The four men and a woman were arrested in a joint operation in Paraguay involving police from both countries, the federal police said in a statement. 
The group had stored weapons in three rented houses and planned to help a Red Command leader escape this weekend, the statement said. It did not give the exact location of the arrests.
Red Command is one of the largest drug gangs in Brazil, where a federal intervention in Rio de Janeiro state has targeted warring drug gangs since February.

""Whenever the Syrian people hold an election, we will leave Syria to its owners after they hold their elections,"" Erdogan said at a forum in Istanbul.
Erdogan agreed with Russian President Vladimir Putin last month to set up a demilitarized zone between rebel and government fighters in northern Syria. It also has a presence in the northwest Afrin region and further east, around Jarablus. 
Erdogan also said on Thursday that Turkey is not experiencing difficulty in conducting talks with radical groups in Idlib, the last major rebel-controlled enclave outside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s control.
Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which includes the al Qaeda-linked group formerly known as Nusra Front, is the most powerful jihadist alliance in Idlib. Turkey designated the group a terrorist organization in August, matching a decision by the United Nations in June.
Last month, in a summit in Sochi, Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to create a demilitarized zone with a depth of 15-20 km, from which radical groups will withdraw by Oct. 15.
On Thursday, Erdogan said that in addition to 12 observation hosted by Turkey in the area, Russia has 10 observation points and Iran has six.

""Securing this corridor means securing Idlib,"" he said. ""And we have started fortifying our observation posts.""

2,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 10:29PM ET</span>",Poll shows Bolsonaro in lead before Brazil's Sunday presidential vote,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro took a commanding first-round lead, according to a Datafolha poll released Thursday, though he is still short of votes to win the election outright this weekend and avoid a runoff vote. 
The poll found Bolsonaro had 35 percent support, a 3 percentage point jump since Tuesday. His nearest rival, Fernando Haddad of the leftist Workers Party, stood at 22 percent. The pair remain deadlocked in a possible runoff vote, Datafolha said.
The poll showed Bolsonaro has 39 percent of the valid votes, 11 points short of a majority needed for a first-round victory. Failing that, the two top vote-getters will face off on Oct. 28.
Brazil's most divisive election in decades will officially come to a close with a televised debate Thursday night. The first-round vote takes place on Sunday. 
Bolsonaro has been unable to campaign, aside from postings on social media, since suffering a brutal stabbing during a rally a month ago. On medical advice, he said he will not take part in Thursday night's debate.
Nonetheless, support for Bolsonaro has surged in recent days - with some observers saying he could even win the presidency in the first-round ballot, with the left-leaning vote split between Haddad and a clutch of other candidates.
In a last push on Thursday, Bolsonaro told a radio station in northeastern Brazil, where his support is weakest and Haddad's is the strongest, that he would put the army to work to help finish some major infrastructure projects long stalled in the region, and said his presidency would invite partners from all parties, including the PT.
""We want to decentralize government revenues and send them to the states, where governors and mayors know best how to apply resources locally,"" he said. 
Haddad's campaign hit hard at Bolsonaro on Thursday, using the last day of TV advertising to compare the former army captain, who has long praised Brazil's 1964-85 dictatorship, to Adolph Hitler. The adverts showed clips of Bolsonaro's more incendiary statements next to footage of the former German leader.

The quake, which struck at 8:58 a.m. (2358 GMT Thursday), had a preliminary magnitude of 5.3, and measured a 'weak 5' on Japan's quake intensity scale of 1 to 7, with 7 being the strongest, Japanese broadcaster NHK said.
There was no danger of a tsunami from the quake, it said.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake, which it measured at 5.2 magnitude, was 42 km (26 miles) deep and centered on Hokkaido's southern coast.

Wedding photos of Dulce Silva and Cesar Yanez, Lopez Obrador's former press aide who will take a key role in the presidential office, were splashed on the cover and across 19 pages of the Mexican edition of Spanish-language society magazine Hola! published on Thursday.
The event, which was attended by 600 guests - including Lopez Obrador, members of his cabinet and social elite - featured a dinner with a menu of lobster and decorations of thousands of white roses and orchids.
Lopez Obrador, who ran on the ticket of a leftist party he founded, defeated the ruling party by a landslide in July's election by capitalizing on the discontent of Mexicans fed up with widespread corruption, poverty and surging violence. 
The magazine spread sparked jeering on social media from many Mexicans who said the event suggested Lopez Obrador's entourage may end up seeking the same privileges enjoyed by the ruling party they blasted during the campaign. 
""What is Cesar Yanez thinking? I believed that his critics exaggerated. I must confess that I had not grasped the magnitude of ... frivolity until I saw the cover of the Hola!"" Rafael Barajas, a political cartoonist for the leftist Jornada newspaper said on Twitter.
Lopez Obrador responded by distancing himself from the affair.
""Well, I did not get married. I was invited, I attended. Everyone is responsible for their own actions,"" he told reporters, pointing out that it was not a government function but a private social event. 
""Of course our adversaries are questioning because they are looking for any possible error to criticize us,"" he said. ""They have the right to do it ... we will continue acting with integrity, with principles, with honesty and republican austerity.""

Lopez Obrador, who is driven around in a economy car and has pledged to sell the presidential jet, has promised to slash government salaries and official privileges in order to boost spending on infrastructure projects and social programs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee will travel to Venezuela ""to assess the current situation,"" a spokeswoman said, amid tensions between Caracas and Washington.
The spokeswoman for Senator Bob Corker, a Republican, said the lawmaker would make the trip in the coming days but could not provide the specific dates in her response to a query from Reuters after sources in Venezuela said Corker would be making the trip.
Corker will meet with U.S. officials, Venezuelan officials, representatives from the opposition and members of the National Assembly and civil society groups, the spokeswoman said. 
He will also meet with members of the Boston Group, a network of U.S. and Venezuelan legislators that had maintained relations between the Caracas’s government and opposition since 2000.
Corker last visited Venezuela in May to secure the release of jailed U.S. citizen Joshua Holt.
The United States imposed new sanctions on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s wife and several of his top allies last week as U.S. President Donald Trump urged members of the United Nations to support a “restoration of democracy” in the once-booming country, a member of OPEC.

The move added pressure on Maduro’s government, which is already widely criticized for economic collapse and undermining democracy. But it does not materially change Washington’s efforts to pressure stalwarts from Venezuela’s Socialist Party who have shown no willingness to hand over power or negotiate a transition.

6,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 08:41PM ET</span>",Pence accuses China of 'malign' campaign to undermine Trump,"By David Brunnstrom and Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence intensified Washington's pressure campaign against Beijing on Thursday by accusing China of ""malign"" efforts to undermine President Donald Trump ahead of next month's congressional elections and reckless military actions in the South China Sea.
In what was billed as a major policy address, Pence sought to build on Trump's speech at the United Nations last week in which he accused China of trying to interfere in the vote that will determine whether his Republican Party will keep control of Congress.
Neither Trump nor Pence provided hard evidence of meddling by China, which last week rejected the president's allegation.
Pence's speech at Washington's Hudson Institute marked a sharpened U.S. approach toward China going beyond the bitter trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. It highlighted disputes such as cyber attacks, Taiwan, freedom of the seas and human rights.
Pence said China was waging a sophisticated effort to sway the elections against the Republicans in retaliation for Trump's trade policies. He vowed to continue to expose Beijing's ""malign influence and interference.""
Pence said Beijing, with an eye not only to the congressional elections but also to Trump's 2020 re-election bid, had “mobilized covert actors, front groups, and propaganda outlets to shift Americans’ perception of Chinese policies” and was targeting its tariffs to hurt states where Trump has strong support.
""China wants a different American president,"" Pence said.
He said that in June, Beijing laid out its strategy in a sensitive ""Propaganda and Censorship Notice"" which stated that China must ""strike accurately and carefully, splitting apart different domestic groups"" in the United States.
The allegations, however, have raised questions as to whether Trump and his aides are trying to deflect attention from an investigation of his campaign’s possible ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and also set up China for blame if Republicans do poorly in November's vote.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement that Pence in his speech had made ""unwarranted accusations ... and slandered China by claiming that China meddles in U.S. internal affairs and elections.""
China is committed to working with the United States for ""non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation,"" she said.
CONFLICTING ACCOUNTS
Washington has long cited China as a major culprit in the hacking of U.S. government and corporate databases. But U.S. officials and independent analysts say they have not detected the kind of systematic manipulation of social media and email hacking Russia was accused of in 2016.
Even so, Pence said: ""As a senior career member of our intelligence community recently told me, what the Russians are doing pales in comparison to what China is doing across this country.""
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told the Washington Post this week there was no indication of any foreign effort to disrupt election infrastructure, but added that ""we know they (China) have the capability and the will.""
China expert Chris Johnson, a former CIA analyst now at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Pence's speech appeared aimed in part at building a narrative that a vote for the Democrats would be vote for China.
""Another part of it is trying to distract attention from the real threat, which is Russia,"" he said. ""There's nothing in that speech that rises to the level of 2016 Russian active measures.""
Trump has justified his trade policy by accusing China of stealing intellectual property and limiting access to its market. The two countries have imposed increasingly severe tariffs on each other.
Pence said Chinese security agencies had masterminded the ""wholesale theft of American technology,"" including military blueprints, and warned Washington would continue to take action.
He urged Google (O:GOOGL) to end development of its ""Dragonfly"" app that would make it easier to track Internet searches and strengthen Chinese censorship.
Google declined comment, except to reiterate that its China search engine project was ""exploratory"" and not close to launch.
Bloomberg Businessweek cited 17 unidentified intelligence and company sources as saying that Chinese spies had placed computer chips in equipment used by about 30 firms, as well as multiple U.S. government agencies, which would give Beijing secret access to internal networks. Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Amazon (O:AMZN) denied the report.
Pence also said China had deployed anti-ship and anti-air missiles on artificial islands in the disputed South China Sea, despite promises not to militarize them.
He accused Beijing of ""reckless harassment"" in an incident on Sunday in which a Chinese naval vessel nearly collided with a U.S. destroyer near the Spratly islands.
""We will not be intimidated,"" Pence said of the operation, the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing’s efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters.
China said a Chinese warship had been sent to warn the U.S. vessel to leave an area of irrefutable Chinese sovereignty.
Pence accused China of using its economic power to bully smaller countries and said it had threatened the stability of the Taiwan Strait by pressuring three Latin American countries to sever ties with Taipei and recognize Beijing. 
Pence also denounced Beijing's crackdown on minority Muslims in the Xinjiang region. 
Last month, a U.N. rights panel said it had received credible reports that up to one million ethnic Uighurs may be held in extra-legal detention in Xinjiang, which China says faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists.
U.S. officials have said they are considering targeted sanctions for human rights abuses.
Daniel Russel, Washington's top diplomat for East Asia until last year, said there was a lot to dislike about China’s behavior. But he said the claim that China was working to defeat Trump at the ballot box ""rings hollow"" and the approach could be counterproductive.

""Even if you accept all of Pence’s complaints at face value, it’s hard to make the case that the administration’s Cold War-style vilification of China will be effective or beneficial to U.S. interests, since it's clearly pushing Beijing to intransigence, not compromise.""

(Reuters) - A 39-year-old U.S. Navy veteran has confessed to sending letters to U.S. President Donald Trump and other senior officials that were initially feared to contain the poison ricin when they were discovered this week, court documents showed.
William Clyde Allen III was arrested on Wednesday at his home in Logan, Utah, and will be charged on Friday, said Melodie Rydalch, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office.
Aside from Trump, Allen is believed to have sent the letters containing ground castor seeds to FBI Director Christopher Wray, Defense Secretary James Mattis and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral John Richardson, according to a probable cause statement filed in Utah state court on Wednesday. 
Allen mailed the envelopes on Sept. 24, the statement said.
The letters were intercepted and no one was hurt, authorities said. The letter addressed to Trump never entered the White House, the U.S. Secret Service has said.
Ricin is found naturally in castor seeds but it takes a deliberate act to convert the seeds into a biological weapon. Ricin can cause death within 36 to 72 hours of exposure to an amount as small as a pinhead. No known antidote exists. 
The probable cause statement did not list a motive in the case. It was filed by an officer with the Utah State Bureau of Investigation and listed Allen's alleged offense as the threat of terrorism. 
It was not clear if Allen has obtained an attorney. He was ordered held in jail on bail of $25,000.

Allen served in the U.S. Navy from October 1998 until October 2002, leaving the service as a seaman apprentice, the second-lowest rank, according to the U.S. Navy Office of Information.

8,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>","For women in Greek migrant camps, even showers are unsafe: Amnesty","By Karolina Tagaris 
ATHENS (Reuters) - Women in Greek migrant camps are too scared to leave their tents at night or use communal showers, and many pregnant women have to sleep on the floor in unsanitary conditions, Amnesty International said on Friday.
More than half of refugees and migrants arriving in Greece are women and children, according to the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR.
The numbers are small compared to those at the height of Europe's migrant crisis in 2015. But slow and lengthy asylum procedures mean thousands of asylum-seekers are holed up in crowded facilities on a few Greek islands. 
There, everyday activities like taking a shower have become dangerous for women and girls, Amnesty said in a report. Lack of sanitation and clean drinking water, as well as streams of raw sewage and mice infestations, are common in all camps, it said.
"" (The) shower in the camp is cold and there is no lock. Men walk in when you are inside. There are no lights in the toilets,"" Amnesty quoted one woman from the Democratic Republic of Congo, whose name was changed to Adele, as saying. 
""At night, sometimes I go to the toilet with my sister or pee in a bucket,"" said Adele, who arrived on the island of Samos in December.
Pregnant asylum-seekers told Amnesty they had to sleep on the floor and had little, if any, access to antenatal care. Other women spent their limited cash on sanitary pads.
""Everything is dirty here. It's impossible to keep clean and when we have our period, it is very difficult,"" Adele said.
Some of Greece's island camps have grown so congested that they operate at more than double their capacity, according to the latest government figures. To ease overcrowding, authorities have begun moving hundreds to facilities on the mainland.
Amnesty said women there said they felt ""abandoned"".
""We feel totally forgotten. Some of us have been in the camp for two years and nothing is changing. We don't know what will happen to us,"" said one Yezidi woman from Iraq staying in the Skaramagas camp near Athens.
Humanitarian organizations working in the camp had reported that smugglers and people bearing weapons had been in the facility, Amnesty said. 

""The enormous failure of European governments to open safe and legitimate routes to refugees fleeing war places women and girls at increased risk of abuse,"" said Amnesty International Secretary-General Kumi Naidoo, who visited the island of Lesbos on Thursday.

9,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>",U.S. counterterrorism strategy puts new focus on Iran and proxies,"By Roberta Rampton and Jonathan Landay
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is giving greater priority to Iran and radical groups it backs in a new U.S. counterterrorism strategy document released on Thursday that further increases the pressure from Washington on Tehran.
The strategy, unveiled by National Security Adviser John Bolton, is the first issued since 2011 when the Obama administration's view of counterterrorism was focused almost exclusively on the threat posed by al Qaeda after the death of its founder, Osama bin Laden. 
The priority given to Iran this time around reflects President Donald Trump’s drive to contain Iran's influence in the Middle East, curtail its ballistic missile program and backing of extremist groups and force it to the negotiating table by re-imposing U.S. sanctions.
Iran was cited only once – on the penultimate page – of the 2011 counterterrorism strategy as an ""active"" state sponsor of ""terrorism."" 
But the current document shows how the Trump administration has put Shi'ite Muslim Iran at the center of U.S. concerns, even as it keeps a focus on Sunni Muslim militant groups in Syria and Iraq.
“In addition, the United States faces terrorist threats from Iran, which remains the most prominent state sponsor of terrorism, really the world’s central banker of international terrorism since 1979,” Bolton told reporters.
""Iran-sponsored terrorist groups such as Lebanese Hezbollah, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad continue to pose a threat to the United States and our interests,"" he said.
Bolton described “radical Islamist terrorist groups"" as the pre-eminent transnational terrorist threat to the United States and to U.S. interests abroad.
He acknowledged that ""additional challenges do remain"" despite U.S.-backed forces having taken most of the areas of Syria and Iraq overrun by the Islamic State group several years ago.
IRANIAN OIL 
Foes since the Iranian Revolution in 1979, Washington and Tehran have been increasingly at odds since Trump pulled out of the 2015 Iran nuclear accord in May and began to reintroduce economic sanctions on Iran.
The United States plans to impose new sanctions targeting Iran's oil sector on Nov. 4. Bolton said the administration aims to compel all importers of Iranian crude to cut their purchases to zero. 
""It's our objective that there be no waivers from the sanctions that exports of Iranian oil and gas and condensates drops to zero. I'm not saying we're necessarily going to achieve that but no one should be operating under any illusions what the objective is,"" Bolton said.
Bolton is a hawk on Iran and believes the reimposition of sanctions is already heaping pressure on Iran's leaders. 
The key thrust of the new strategy, Bolton said, includes pursuing extremists “to their source” and cutting them off “from their sources of support,” goals that in part appear aimed at Iran’s backing for groups like Hezbollah and Houthis rebels in Yemen.
Counterterrorism strategy documents outline a U.S. administration's blueprint for tackling the threat of extremism - from military action to intelligence operations to cooperating with partners and allies and the use of sanctions and other financial tools. 

President Barack Obama’s 2011 strategy emphasized at length principles that included respect for human rights, promoting good governance and the rule of law. The Trump administration's document gave little room to such concerns.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's former authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori on Thursday appealed to current President Martín Vizcarra and to judges not to return him to prison because his ""heart would not cope.""
The former president, 80, spoke from a private clinic where he is undergoing treatment for heart disease and under police guard, in a video address aired on Peru's independent Canal N cable television station. 
""I want to ask the president of the republic and members of the judiciary one thing only: Please, don't kill me,"" Fujimori said. ""If I return to prison, my heart will not cope. It is too weak to go through the same thing again."" 
The former strongman also urged the current authorities not to use him as a ""political weapon"" since he had ""no forces to resist."" 
Fujimori was transported by ambulance to a local clinic on Wednesday after a judge annulled a pardon granted to him last year and ordered his immediate capture and return to prison over human rights abuse allegations. [nL2N1WK1EE]
The ruling by Supreme Court Judge Hugo Nunez marked the latest reversal in fortunes for Fujimori, an agricultural engineer who rose to the presidency on a populist platform in 1990 and a decade later resigned by fax from his parents' homeland of Japan as accusations against him mounted.
Following his extradition to Peru in 2007, Fujimori was sentenced to 25 years in prison for commanding death squads that massacred civilians in a counterinsurgency campaign during his right-wing government. He was later found guilty of corruption.
Former President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski granted Fujimori a humanitarian pardon on Christmas Eve, three days after Kuczynski narrowly survived an impeachment vote with the help of Fujimori's supporters in Congress. [nL1N1P0069]
Fujimori's attorney Miguel Perez on Wednesday filed an appeal and requested a suspension of the arrest order, on the grounds of his client's failing health.

11,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>",U.S. agency saw sharp rise in sexual harassment complaints after #MeToo,"By Daniel Wiessner
(Reuters) - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said on Thursday that the number of sexual harassment complaints workers filed with the agency over the past year rose for the first time in nearly a decade, attributing the increase to the #MeToo movement.
The commission said the number of complaints, known as charges, filed in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 rose more than 12 percent over the previous year, when it received about 6,700. It said the numbers were preliminary, as the agency typically publishes comprehensive data from its fiscal year by the following February.
EEOC Acting Chair Victoria Lipnic said in a statement that the numbers reflected ""the heightened demand of the #MeToo movement.""
The #MeToo movement emerged in response to accusations of sexual harassment and abuse by powerful men in the entertainment industry starting last October. Many lawyers and other experts had predicted that the movement would spur an uptick in harassment claims. 
The number of sexual harassment charges lodged with the EEOC had fallen each year since 2010, when nearly 8,000 were filed. Many worker advocates and women's rights groups, as well as the commission in a 2016 report, said that was likely due to victims not reporting harassment rather than employers effectively addressing it. 
In order to sue employers for harassment, workers must first file charges with the EEOC, which enforces federal laws banning workplace discrimination based on sex and other factors. They also can file complaints with state agencies that enforce anti-discrimination laws, so the EEOC's numbers do not provide a full picture. 
The EEOC on Thursday also said it had filed 41 lawsuits including sexual harassment claims against employers over the past year, a 50 percent increase over fiscal year 2017. The commission in most cases gives workers the right to sue on their own, but can file its own lawsuits.
The commission recovered nearly $70 million for victims of sexual harassment in the past year, up more than $20 million from the previous year.
The impact of #MeToo has also been felt in some courts. In July, a federal appeals court in Philadelphia cited the movement in reviving a sexual harassment lawsuit by a former secretary for a Pennsylvania county. 
The court said #MeToo has shown that many victims of workplace harassment fear retaliation if they speak out, and said victims should not be blocked from suing their employers because they failed to report misconduct.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Former rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight was sentenced in a Los Angeles courtroom on Thursday to 28 years in prison for manslaughter in the death of a man he ran over with his pickup truck outside a hamburger stand in 2015.
The sentence appeared to forestall any chance of a future recording business comeback for Knight, 53, known as much for repeated run-ins with the law as for his career as a hip-hop executive promoting the likes of Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and Tupac Shakur during the 1990s.
The co-founder of the influential label Death Row Records pleaded no contest on Sept. 20 to one count of voluntary manslaughter for the hit-and-run killing of 55-year-old Terry Carter.
He admitted then to using a ""deadly and dangerous weapon"" on Jan. 29, 2015, when he ran down two men with his pickup truck in an altercation outside Tam's Burgers that spilled over from a quarrel on the nearby set of a TV commercial for the film ""Straight Outta Compton.""
Carter later died of his injuries. The second man, Cle ""Bone"" Sloan, was left with a badly mangled left foot and head injuries. Knight, who was out on bail in a robbery case at the time, fled the scene but was later arrested.
Knight had previously contended that he accidentally struck the two men with his vehicle while trying to flee what he thought was an ambush attempt.
Had Knight been convicted of murder and attempted murder as originally charged, he faced a life sentence with no eligibility for parole for 25 years.
As part of his agreement with prosecutors to plead no contest - the legal equivalent of guilty - to the lesser offense of manslaughter, all other charges in the case were dropped. Two separate criminal cases in which he was charged with robbery and making criminal threats were also dismissed. 
Judge Ronald Coen said Knight had earned the equivalent of 4.2 years credit for time served in pretrial detention. He also is eligible to shave another 15 percent, or 4.2 years, off his term for good behavior while in prison, meaning he could end up serving nearly 20 years before release.
Seated beside his lawyer and wearing an orange jail uniform and horned-rimmed glasses, the burly, bald ex-college football player showed no visible emotion as sentence was pronounced. He did not address the court.
Knight previously served more than half of a nine-year term for violating the probation he received in 1995 for an assault on two aspiring rappers at a Hollywood recording studio.
The probation violation stemmed from a scuffle involving Knight at a Las Vegas hotel in September 1996, hours before Shakur was shot to death while riding in a car with Knight on the Las Vegas Strip. Knight was slightly wounded in the attack.
Knight was later named by police as a suspect in the shooting death of rival rap artist Christopher Wallace, known as Notorious B.I.G., but was never charged. Both rap murders remain unsolved.

In 2002, the year after his release from prison, a federal racketeering probe of Knight and his record label was closed with the company pleading guilty to misdemeanor tax charges. The onetime college football star and ""gangsta"" rap pioneer eventually lost control of his label in bankruptcy proceedings.

Since a parliamentary election in May, political wrangling has prevented Lebanon from forming a national unity government, raising concerns in a country with one of the world's highest rates of public debt.
""The economic situation is very difficult...(it) can't bear political disputes,"" Hariri said in an interview on a prime-time television show on Thursday night. ""There are solutions, which (President Michel Aoun) and I have discussed."" 
In the five months since the May vote, Hariri has expressed optimism several times about a near breakthrough.
Key parties in Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system have jostled over ministries, as foreign donors urged avoiding any more delay and Lebanese politicians warned of economic crisis.
A Paris donors conference in April yielded pledges of billions, conditional on reform that a new government will have to undertake. 

Lebanon's last coalition government continued as a caretaker administration after the May vote, which produced a parliament tilted in favor of the Iran-backed Shi'ite Hezbollah movement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday charged seven Russian intelligence officers with conspiring to hack computers and steal data from the nuclear energy company Westinghouse Electric Co as well as anti-doping watchdogs, sporting federations and an international agency probing the use of chemical weapons.
The charges of conspiracy to commit computer fraud and abuse and to commit wire fraud and money laundering came hours after Dutch authorities said they had disrupted an attempt by Russian intelligence agents to hack into the Hague-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in April.
That organization is tasked with probing the use of chemical weapons in Syria and the March 2018 poisoning of a former Russian military intelligence officer in the United Kingdom.
The Justice Department said one of the Russian officers researched Westinghouse and its employees online and stole log-in credentials of Westinghouse workers for servers in the United States, including staff that work at its advanced nuclear reactor development and new reactor technology units.
Westinghouse, which is located outside Pittsburgh, provides fuel, services and nuclear power plant design to customers, including Ukraine. 
“We have found no evidence that the phishing campaigns against employees to breach Westinghouse’s systems were successful,"" the company said in a statement. 
It added that it is cooperating with the Justice Department, but could not go into specifics because the investigation is ongoing.
Three of the seven Russian military officers indicted on Thursday were charged in a separate case brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office for their role in hacking activities designed to influence the 2016 presidential election.
John Demers, the head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, said while the defendants overlap, the case brought on Thursday did not involve Mueller’s office. 
In the indictment, prosecutors alleged that one of the Russian officers, Ivan Sergeyevich Yermakov, who was also charged by Mueller in the election-related hacking, performed “technical reconnaissance” on Westinghouse to gain access to IP addresses, domains and network ports starting in November 2014. 
In December 2014, the hackers registered a fake domain and website designed to mimic the company’s website and sent phishing emails to at least five employees. Once people clicked on the spoofed domain and provided their log-ins, they were rerouted to the original network.
On other occasions, according to the indictment, the conspirators also sent spear-phishing emails to the personal emails of employees at Westinghouse. Two account users clicked on the malicious links. 
The indictment alleges that the seven defendants, all of whom are members of Russia's military intelligence agency, sought to sow disinformation and create an influence campaign as retaliation for the exposure of a Russian state-sponsored athlete doping program.
The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and the World Anti-Doping Agency were among their hacking targets, as well sporting organizations including the Federation Internationle de Football Association (FIFA) and athletes whose medical records were stolen and later publicized.
Russia has denied meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, contradicting a unanimous conclusion by U.S. intelligence agencies.
All seven of the defendants are presumed to be in Russia, which does not have an extradition treaty with the United States. The indictment could make it hard for them to travel to other countries.
The hackers traveled to other countries to carry out hacking activities, sometimes with the use of diplomatic passports, prosecutors allege.
Such efforts, known as ""on-site"" or ""close access"" hacking operations, were carried out in cases where remote hacking from Russia did not provide ""sufficient access"" to networks.
One such trip, for instance, was Rio de Janeiro before and during the 2016 summer Olympic games.
Some of the stolen data was later published under the false auspices of a hacktivist group known as ""Fancy Bears Hack Team.""
""Close access operations, like the ones exposed today, are reminders of the considerable resources available to nation states,"" said John Hultquist, director of intelligence analysis at the cyber firm FireEye.
While the motive behind the hacks involving anti-doping groups and organizations probing Russian poisonings were more clear-cut, the decision to target Westinghouse was less apparent.
Justice Department officials declined to provide additional details on Thursday about the attacks on the company.
Efforts to penetrate its networks started in late 2014, some nine months after Ukraine's pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych was removed from power during the Ukrainian Revolution. 
This is not the first time Westinghouse has been a victim of a state-sponsored hack.
In May 2014, the Justice Department indicted five Chinese military hackers who targeted U.S.-based nuclear power, metals and solar sectors.
According to that indictment, Westinghouse had entered into a deal with a Chinese nuclear company to construct and run four nuclear power plants in China. 

But during the talks, prosecutors say one of the defendants stole proprietary and confidential technical designs and other data from Westinghouse.

COLOMBEY-LES-DEUX-EGLISES, France (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron sought to wrap himself in the mantle of war hero Charles de Gaulle on Thursday after a spate of ministerial resignations dim an aura of invincibility that accompanied his first year in power.
Macron helicoptered into Colombey-Les-Deux-Eglises in eastern France, where de Gaulle had his country estate, to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the constitution the former general drew up, creating a powerful role for the president.
Hailing the durability of France's presidential system before laying a wreath at de Gaulle's tomb, Macron said: ""It allows me to avoid the tyranny of immediacy, which is an absurdity of our times, which means day-to-day vagaries should not decide a nation’s course."" 
Macron has sought to paint himself as a leader in the mold of de Gaulle, a towering father-figure of modern-day France who made strong authority a totem of his presidency and had a deep sense of belief in his own destiny. In his official photograph, a copy of de Gaulle's war memoirs sit on Macron's desk.
But even de Gaulle, who frequently ranks in polls as one of France's greatest historical figures, lost the sheen of success as he sought to rebuild the French economy after World War Two and reform political institutions. 
""De Gaulle could be imperious so long as he delivered positive results for France. Macron faces the same challenge as events crowd in on him,"" said Jonathan Fenby, author of ""The General: Charles de Gaulle and the France He Saved"".
IN THE GENERAL'S FOOTSTEPS
Sixty years ago, de Gaulle felt a duty to transform France as it grappled with a bloody colonial war in Algeria and weak and unstable institutions. Macron too believes he must overhaul France to make its institutions more efficient, create growth and counter the rise of far-right populism.
""It was the spirit of 1958, it must be that of 2018, because today as then and today perhaps more than then, the people want to feel listened to by political elites constantly asked to prove themselves,"" Macron said in a speech on Thursday.
Macron, 40, wants to revamp France's constitution to cut the number of lawmakers by a third and introduce an unaccustomed dose of proportional representation. 
Yet even as Macron sought to place himself in the General's footsteps, his so-called ""day-to-day vagaries"" were quick to catch up with him as he met mostly white-haired pensioners in Colombey-Les-Deux-Eglises. 
Some complained about the higher levies Macron imposed on their pensions in order to lower those on workers. ""Are you joking?"" one said as he denied that pensions had been eroded.
With typical frankness, Macron said France would be a better place if people complained less. ""The General's grandson earlier told me, 'We used to be able to speak freely. The one thing we weren’t allowed to do was complain',"" he told the retirees.
Macron's frequent sharp tongue - he berated striking workers for ""kicking up a bloody mess"" and called critics of his labor law reforms ""slackers"" - has exposed him to accusations of being an arrogant and patronizing president.
""I think the General had it right,"" Macron said. ""You know, this country would be different if we were like that. We don't realize how immensely lucky we are.""

16,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 03:46PM ET</span>",Brazil's next president to struggle for base in Congress,"By Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Whoever wins Brazil's presidential race this month will inherit a fiscal straight jacket and a drifting economy in urgent need of repair - but will have no governing coalition in Congress to pass reforms.
On Sunday, Brazilians will vote for the president, all 513 members of the lower house of Congress, and two-thirds of the 81-member Senate.
The next president, who will take the helm on Jan. 1, will have to hit the ground running on the economic agenda, as the economy revives from its deepest recession in decades and a long-delayed overhaul of Brazil's costly pension system looms. 
""The situation is critical. The economy is in a tailspin that everyone is interested in pulling out. Companies are losing money and workers are losing jobs,"" said Danilo Gennari, head of government relations firm Distrito.
But making major changes will require the kind of congressional deal-making and alliances with which both lead candidates could struggle.
The front-runner ahead of Sunday's vote, far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, has cried foul at the horse-trading of Brazilian politics, where presidents use patronage and pork barrel politics to form working alliances in Congress.
Should he win, the right-winger will have no choice but to negotiate with Congress in order to govern, however. Bolsonaro's tiny Social Liberal Party (PSL) has only one ally, which is even smaller. Between them, they can hope to elect at most 20 members of the lower chamber.
On the left, Workers Party candidate Fernando Haddad lies second in the polls, thanks largely to the popularity of jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the party's founder. Haddad will likely face Bolsonaro in a run-off on Oct. 28, which polls show either could win.
Haddad, who for now can count on only one coalition member, the miniscule Communist Party, may face a daunting task trying to rebuild the coalition in Congress that helped the Workers Party govern Brazil for 13 of the last 15 years. Those alliances exploded during the impeachment of Lula's successor, Dilma Rousseff, amid Brazil's biggest-ever corruption scandal.
As a result, although the Workers Party should control some 50 seats in the lower house, Haddad will find it harder than Bolsonaro to build further backing, analysts said. 
""Haddad will face a more difficult task because he would probably not have the full support of the center parties nor the (current ruling party) MDB,"" said David Fleischer, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Brasilia.
The center bloc, nicknamed the ""centrão"" or ""big center,"" has held sway in Congress for years and flexed its muscles when ramming through Rousseff's impeachment in 2016. 
Center parties could win 170 seats on Sunday and they will most likely vote on Bolsonaro's side of the aisle. If the MDB follows suit, Fleischer believes the fiery lawmaker running on a law-and-order and anti-corruption platform could forge a workable majority. 
The centrist PSDB, a traditional Workers Party rival, may also back some of Bolsonaro's proposals.
Bolsonaro's rage at the traditional give-and-take of Brasilia politics sounds like little more than campaign rhetoric, Fleischer said.

BIBLE, BULLETS AND BEEF
A good starting point for an eventual Bolsonaro coalition will be the powerful farm lobby that endorsed his candidacy this week. The Parliamentary Agricultural Front (FPA) holds more than a third of the lower house and a quarter of Senate seats.
Farmers in Brazil's booming soy belt back Bolsonaro because he plans to ease gun laws and encourages landowners to defend themselves from rising crime in rural areas.
Most of the Evangelical Christian caucus in Congress already backs Bolsonaro for his strident defense of family values and his vows to block the legalization of abortion, gay marriage and drugs.
""The farmers will vote blindly for him. He can rally the agricultural, evangelical and gun lobby members to press their party leaders to form a coalition,"" said Gennari.
One of the first tests of congressional relations may be a request by the incoming president to raise the budget deficit target for 2019 to give leeway for spending on projects to stoke the economy. Approval for privatizing state companies to close the budget gap, as Bolsonaro's economic team has suggested, could also be a key trial. 
Most political leaders are well aware of the gravity of the fiscal crisis and some form of pension reform should get the votes to pass, said Cristiano Noronha, vice president of Arko Advice consultancy.

""I'm moderately optimistic. One candidate could propose a more aggressive plan, the other a lighter one, but they both see the need for reform,"" Noronha said.

A year after a failed bid for independence, Iraq's Kurds voted on Sunday in a parliamentary election that could disrupt the delicate balance of power in the region.
With 85 percent of ballots counted, the KDP was leading with 595,592 votes, the Independent High Elections and Referendum Commission (KHEC) said in a news conference.
Its historic rival and junior coalition partner in government, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), was in second place with 287,575 votes.
The commission said it had received and was investigating 1,045 complaints, which is why it had not published final results.
On Sunday, the PUK said it might not recognize the results of the election due to what it described as violations in the voting process, and then appeared to backtrack, injecting uncertainty into the process.
Election observers also said there were irregularities.
With opposition parties weak, the KDP and PUK are likely to extend their almost three decades of sharing power, but the preliminary results suggest that Masoud Barzani's KDP will take a dominant position in Kurdish politics.
The two parties, who fought a civil war in the 1990s but more recently have taken to sharing power, have just come out of a grueling political battle in Baghdad, where they competed for the presidency of federal Iraq. The PUK came out on top with the election of Barham Salih.
The largest Kurdish opposition party, Gorran, or Movement for Change, was in a distant third with 164,336 votes. There are 111 seats in the Iraqi Kurdistan Parliament, with 11 reserved for minority groups.

SONORAN DESERT, Ariz. (Reuters) - The brightly-colored crosses that Alvaro Enciso plants in the unforgiving hard sand of Arizona's Sonoran desert mark what he calls 'the end of an American dream' - the places where a migrant died after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.
The bodies of nearly 3,000 migrants have been recovered in southern Arizona since 2000, according to the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner. Aid group Humane Borders, which sets up water stations along migrant trails, said that may be only a fraction of the total death toll, with most bodies never recovered.
Humane Borders, in partnership with the medical examiner's office, publishes a searchable online map, which marks with a red dot the exact location where each migrant body was found.
It was that map and its swarms of red dots that inspired Enciso, a 73-year-old artist and self-described 'reluctant activist,' to start his project. 
""I saw this map with thousands of red dots on it, just one on top of the other,"" he told Reuters at his workshop in Tucson in September. ""I want to go where those red dots (are). You know, the place where a tragedy took place. And be there and feel that place where the end of an American dream happened to someone,"" he said. 
The red dots of the map are represented by a circle of red metal Enciso nails to each cross, which he makes in his workshop. He decorates the crosses with small pieces of objects left behind by migrants, which he collects on his trips to the desert.
With temperatures topping 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius), Alvaro and his two assistants, Ron Kovatch and Frank Sagona, hauled two large wooden crosses, a shovel, jugs of water and a bucket of concrete powder through the scrubby desert south of Arizona's Interstate 8, weaving through clumps of mesquite trees and saguaro cacti. 
They used a portable GPS device to navigate to a featureless patch of rocky ground - the place where the remains of 40 year-old Jose Apolinar Garcia Salvador were found on Sept. 14, 2006, his birthplace and cause of death never recorded. 
They planted another cross for a second person who was never identified, one of 1,100 recovered from Arizona's deserts since 2000 whose names are unknown.
Enciso, who left Colombia in the 1960s to attend college in the United States, considers the crosses part art project and part social commentary. He would like to see an end to migrant deaths in the desert and a change in U.S. immigration laws.  

""We cannot continue to be a land, a country that was created on the idea that we accept everybody here. We have broken the number one rule of what America is all about,"" he said.

19,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 02:15PM ET</span>",West accuses 'pariah state' Russia of global hacking campaign,"By Guy Faulconbridge, Anthony Deutsch and Lisa Lambert
LONDON/THE HAGUE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Western countries issued coordinated denunciations of Russia on Thursday for running what they described as a global hacking campaign, targeting institutions from sports anti-doping bodies to a nuclear power company and the chemical weapons watchdog.
In some of the strongest language aimed at Moscow since the Cold War, Britain said Russia had become a ""pariah state"".
The United States said Moscow must be made to pay the price for its actions. And their allies around the world issued stark assessments of what they described as a campaign of hacking by Russia's GRU military intelligence agency.
Russia denied what its Foreign Ministry spokeswoman called a ""diabolical perfume cocktail"" of allegations dreamt up by someone with a ""rich imagination"".
But the accusations deepen Moscow's isolation at a time when its diplomatic ties with the West have been downgraded over the poisoning of an ex-spy and while it is under U.S. and EU sanctions over actions in Ukraine.
Britain and the Netherlands accused Russia of sending agents with wifi antennas to the Hague to try to hack into the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) while it was investigating an attack on an ex-spy in England.
The United States indicted seven suspected Russian agents for conspiring to hack computers and steal data to delegitimize international anti-doping organizations and punish officials who had revealed a Russian state-sponsored athlete doping program.
They were also accused of trying to hack into Westinghouse Electric Co, a nuclear power company that provides atomic fuel and plant designs. The Justice Department said one of the Russians performed reconnaissance of personnel and stole login credentials at the company.
Three of the seven had already been indicted by the special prosecutor investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, which Moscow denies.
The various accusations were announced at briefings around the globe that were held as NATO defense ministers gathered in Brussels to present a united front to their Cold War-era foe.
""This is not the actions of a great power, these are the actions of a pariah state,"" British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson told reporters.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, at a news conference in the Belgian capital, said Russia must pay a price, and a number of response options were available.
EU officials said in a statement Russia's ""aggressive act demonstrated contempt for the solemn purpose"" of the OPCW. 
Australia, New Zealand and Canada were among other countries to issue strongly worded statements backing their allies' findings.
Russian officials portrayed the allegations as part of an anti-Russian campaign intended to entrench Moscow's reputation as an enemy. Accusations against Russia ""know no limits"", said Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov.
Dutch authorities said they had disrupted the attempt to hack into the Hague-based OPCW in April, a time when the watchdog was looking into both the attack on ex-spy Sergei Skripal in Britain and chemical strikes in Syria that the West has blamed on Russia's ally President Bashar al-Assad.
Four Russians arrived in the Netherlands on April 10 and were caught three days later with spying equipment at a hotel located next to the OPCW headquarters, the Dutch military intelligence agency said. The men had planned to travel on to a laboratory in Spiez, Switzerland used by the OPCW to analyze samples. Instead, they were expelled to Russia.
The Netherlands released copies of passports of the four, which identified them as Alexey Minin, Oleg Sotnikov, Evgenii Serebriakov and Aleksei Morenets, all in their 30s or 40s. Reuters was not immediately able to contact them. 
AGGRESSOR
Earlier on Thursday, Britain released an assessment based on work by its National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which cast Russia's GRU military intelligence agency as a cyber aggressor which used a network of hackers to sow worldwide discord.
The GRU, Britain said, was almost certainly behind the BadRabbit and World Anti-Doping Agency hacking attacks of 2017, the hack of the U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 2016 and the theft of emails from a UK-based TV station in 2015.
""The GRU’s actions are reckless and indiscriminate: they try to undermine and interfere in elections in other countries,"" said British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. ""Our message is clear - together with our allies, we will expose and respond to the GRU's attempts to undermine international stability.""
The GRU, now formally known in Russia by a shorter acronym GU, is the agency Britain has blamed for sending two agents to kill Skripal -- himself a former GRU agent -- with a nerve agent sprayed on his door. Russia says the two men were sightseers who visited Skripal's home town twice on a weekend trip to England.
Skripal, his daughter and a police officer fell seriously ill and a British woman later died from poison her partner found in a discarded perfume bottle.
After the Skripal poisoning, dozens of Western countries launched the biggest expulsion of Russian spies working under diplomatic cover since the height of the Cold War. Moscow replied with expulsions of Westerners.
In a separate case on Thursday, a Norwegian court extended for a second two-week period the detention of a Russian citizen suspected of spying on Norway's parliament. Norway arrested Mikhail Bochkaryov on Sept. 21 as he was about to fly out of the country. Moscow says he is a Russian parliamentary staff member and has demanded Oslo lift the ""absurd charges"".
Britain said the GRU was associated with a host of hackers including APT 28, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Pawnstorm, Sednit, CyberCaliphate, Cyber Berkut and Voodoo Bear.

The United States has sanctioned GRU officers including its chief, Igor Korobov, in 2016 and 2018 for attempted interference in the 2016 U.S. election and cyber attacks.

The video of the attack on student Marie Laguerre, which she posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on July 25, boosted support for plans to punish sexual harassment on France's streets with fines.
The court determined that the defendant, named only as Firas M., was responsible for his acts when he punched Laguerre.
The sentence also included a further six months suspended jail term. He will also have to undergo treatment for drug and alcohol addiction.
""My client wanted a punishment but she didn't want his head to roll, she just wanted him to learn a lesson,"" said Noemie Saidi-Cottier, Laguerre's lawyer. ""If he never does that again, she feels she has won.""
Days after the video went viral, lawmakers adopted a law imposing on-the-spot fines of up to 750 euros on cat-callers and aggressively lecherous people.
Firas M. was convicted for aggravated violence with an object used as a weapon and not sexual harassment since the new law was passed after the assault. 
The footage showed a passerby throw an ashtray at a woman he had yelled at, then walk back towards her and punch her in the face before calmly walking away. Three men and a woman from the cafe terrace challenged the aggressor but eventually let him go.
Police arrested him in August.

The investigation started in March 2016 when three of the bank's customers had money removed from their accounts shortly after interacting with 27-year old employee, Liberty Staph, who worked in a HSBC branch in central London.
Staph has pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud by abusing her position.
HSBC declined to comment.

22,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",Address of Russian hacking suspect is a spy agency unit - records show,"By Maria Tsvetkova and Maria Kolomychenko
MOSCOW (Reuters) - One of the Russians accused by U.S. officials of conducting cyber attacks around the world is registered at an address in Moscow that has been identified by the U.S. government as a base of Russian military intelligence.
Alexei Morenets was one of seven Russians named in a U.S. indictment released on Thursday. He is accused of hacking into the networks of international sports bodies in Switzerland and a chemical weapons watchdog in the Netherlands.
Morenets is registered as living at a building on Moscow's Komsomolsky Prospect, according to someone who had seen the address on two official Russian databases - one for vehicle registration and another for home addresses.
The specific address is the same one that, according to the U.S. indictment, is home to Military Unit 26165, a unit of the GRU military intelligence service. A publicly available database of Russian legal entities also gives the location as legal address for the unit with the same number.
Morenets was listed as a registered owner of a Russian-made VAZ car, that had Military Unit 26165 as a place of registration for several years in the mid-2000s, according to the vehicle registration database.
The name and date of birth of the Alexei Morenets registered at the Moscow address match the passport details of one of the Russians who Dutch officials on Wednesday accused of trying to hack into the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in the Hague.
Another of the seven Russians, Alexei Minin, also has an address related to the Russian military. He is registered as living at a building on Narodnogo Opolcheniya street in Moscow. This is the legal address of the Military Academy run by the Russian Defence Ministry.
Reuters was unable to contact either of the men by telephone.
The Dutch and U.S. authorities said publicly that Morenets and the other alleged hackers were GRU officers.
But the detail about the Moscow address gives an indication of how investigators may have tied the suspects to Russian military intelligence.
When Reuters tried to reach Military Unit 26165 by phone, someone picked up and said the unit moved out long ago. Reuters called another military unit registered at the same building and a man answered the phone.
Asked if the call had come through to military unit 06410 he said: ""I can't confirm or deny that. You won't get any information here anyway.""
A number listed for Morenets was de-activated.
A taxi receipt which Dutch officials said was found on one of the alleged hackers offered another clue linking the hacking suspects to the GRU.
The receipt was found when the suspects were detained earlier this year before being expelled from the Netherlands. The receipt was for a journey across Moscow carried out on April 10, shortly before they arrived in the Netherlands. 

It gave the destination as Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, and the pick-up point as Nesvizhsky Lane. That street runs directly behind the address given in the U.S. indictment for GRU Military Unit No. 26165.

HAWASSA, Ethiopia (Reuters) - Ethiopia's government is failing to protect its citizens amid escalating ethnic violence that has displaced nearly a million people in the last six months, the head of a national human rights body that reports to parliament said on Thursday.
Among other conflicts along ethnic lines, fighting in the south between the Oromo and Gedeo groups has escalated since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed - the first leader from the Oromo ethnic group in Ethiopia's modern history - came to office in March.
Last week alone, more than 70,000 people, mostly Oromos - the largest ethnic group in the country, were targeted by members of other groups in the western state of Benishangul-Gumuz, regional officials said.
""In some cases, security officials deliberately avoided stepping in. It is when the government fails in its responsibility to protect its citizens that such rights abuses took place,"" Addisu Gebregziabher, head of the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, told Reuters.
It is the first time Addisu has publicly criticized Abiy's administration for its handling of the violence.
The independent commission also investigated the conduct of the Ethiopian authorities during the three years of unrest that forced the resignation of the previous prime minister, paving the way for Abiy's appointment.
""The conflicts we are seeing involve serious human rights abuses,"" Addisu told Reuters after a news conference in the southern city of Hawassa, where the ruling coalition is holding a long-delayed congress.
The event is expected to help cement the authority of Abiy, a 42-year-old former army officer who has presided over major political and economic changes in the country in his short time in power.
Some critics say that Abiy has loosened his coalition's grip on the country and that releasing political prisoners and lifting a ban on opposition groups has led to the surge in ethnic violence as dormant rivalries were allowed to resurface.
Government spokesman Ahmed Shide did not answer phone calls requesting comment on Thursday afternoon, while the ruling coalition's meeting was continuing.
Though Abiy's new approach has drawn praise inside Ethiopia and abroad, his rhetoric is beginning to ring hollow in some parts of the country due to the rising violence -- and concerns that his government is not acting to stop it.
Referring to the violence, Addisu said: ""There is also a lack of accountability. For instance, while some regional officials were apprehended for stoking violence in Gedeo, others are yet to be held accountable.""

He said that in the case of the ethnic violence in Benishangul-Gumuz, regional officials had prevented his commission from carrying out research in some areas.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. general on Thursday sharply criticized Russia's deployment of the S-300 surface-to-air missile system in Syria, saying it was a needless escalation and a knee-jerk response to last month's downing of a Russian military aircraft there.
Army General Joseph Votel, who oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East, said the deployment also appeared to be an effort by Moscow to help shield ""nefarious activities"" by Iranian and Syrian forces in the country.
U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered bombing of Syria two times since taking office last year in response to what he says was Syria's use of chemical weapons in that country's civil war. 
Israel has justified its air raids in Syria by saying they are needed to foil deployments and arms transfers by Iran or Lebanon’s Hezbollah guerrillas, both allies of Damascus.
The S-300 deployment ""appears to be an effort to cover for Iranian and Syrian regime nefarious activities in Syria. So, again, I think this is a needless, needless escalation,"" Votel told reporters at the Pentagon. 
Moscow said on Tuesday that it had delivered the S-300 following a decision it took after accusing Israel of indirect responsibility for the downing of a Russian spy plane by Syrian forces as they fired on attacking Israeli jets in September.
Reuters reported in 2015 that Israel had trained against a Russian-supplied S-300 system in Greece. The United States has also been deepening its military cooperation with Greece, a NATO ally. Last month, Greece hosted U.S. General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in Athens.
'PROBLEMATIC'
Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz, a member of Israel's security cabinet, acknowledged that the S-300 deployment was ""a problematic matter for us.""
""And it could be for the Americans too. This is a system which certainly makes things difficult for us and requires that solutions be found,"" Steinitz told Israel's Army Radio.
At the same time, Steinitz acknowledged that the technology driving the S-300 was decades old, with systems developed in the 1970s. He said Israel would continue its campaign against Iran in Syria and would overcome the challenges posed by the S-300.
Votel said the U.S. military was aware of the S-300's capabilities and did not suggest the system's deployment would halt any U.S. military activities in Syria, where U.S. forces are battling Islamic State militants.
""Our forces here have been operating under a latent anti-air threat for some time and we will continue to do so,"" he said. The United States has been ramping up its rhetoric against Iran in recent weeks as it tightens sanctions against the country after pulling out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran on Wednesday for threats to American missions in Iraq and said the United States was terminating a treaty of amity with Tehran, which is the target of increasing U.S. sanctions over its missile programs.
Votel suggested that countries in the region had good reason to be concerned about Iran's activities in Syria.

""We believe they are moving lethal capabilities into Syria that threaten neighbors in the region,"" he said.

The falling support for the Christian Social Union (CSU) suggests the party will lose the absolute majority with which it has ruled Bavaria for most of the post-war period, a development that risks grave implications for Merkel's government in Berlin.
The Infratest dimap poll for broadcaster ARD showed support for the CSU falling two points to 33 percent. Such a result would compare with the 47.7 percent the CSU scored in the last state vote in 2013 and see the party lose its absolute majority. 
The CSU has fallen short of an absolute majority in Bavaria's state assembly only once since 1954, when it missed by two seats in 2008. Its vote share, usually close to 50 percent, has not fallen below 43 percent in 64 years.
That regional power has assured Bavarian CSU leaders a solid grip on senior cabinet positions in the conservative national governments that have dominated post-war Germany.
If the latest poll is right, the vote will be a heavy blow to CSU leader Horst Seehofer, who props up Merkel's coalition government in Berlin and serves as interior minister. If he is weakened, Seehofer could become more prickly - or even quit.
Seehofer was at the center of a crisis over the fate of Germany's spy chief last month that came close to tearing apart Merkel's ruling coalition, an awkward alliance of her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the CSU and the left-leaning Social Democratic Party (SPD).
The Infratest dimap poll showed support for the ecologist Greens up one point at 18 percent, which would make them the second largest party in Bavaria.
Support for the SPD was unchanged at 11 percent and the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) was also steady, at 10 percent, an outcome that would see the anti-immigration party muscle into Bavaria's regional parliament for the first time.

Infratest dimap polled 1,002 Bavarian voters on Monday and Tuesday. The poll showed that 71 percent of those surveyed thought Bavaria would be better off with a coalition government.

26,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 12:52PM ET</span>",EU court may decide before Christmas if UK can unilaterally reverse Brexit,"By Elisabeth O'Leary
EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Scotland's Court of Session said on Thursday it has asked the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for a preliminary ruling on whether the British parliament can change its mind about leaving the European Union without the bloc's agreement.
Britain's Conservative government is struggling to reach a deal with the EU on how it will leave the world's biggest trading bloc as the March 29 exit date approaches. 
Petitioners, who represent Scottish voters, successfully argued to the Scottish court that if parliament is to vote on the government's eventual Brexit deal, it needs legal certainty on whether the process can be reversed without permission from the other 27 EU states.
The Court of Session has asked the Luxembourg-based ECJ, which rules on the meaning of EU law, for a preliminary ruling, the court said in a statement.
The British government, which has said it has no plans to reverse Brexit and therefore does not need to know, said it was disappointed by the decision. 
""We are giving it careful consideration,"" a government spokeswoman said. ""But as the government has repeatedly said, we are committed to implementing the result of the referendum and will not be revoking Article 50."" 
The Article 50 withdrawal clause in the EU's Lisbon Treaty can be reversed with the permission of the other 27 EU members.
But it does not specify whether the exit process can be unilaterally reversed, although former British diplomat Lord Kerr who drafted it has said Britain can change its mind at any stage before the final exit date in 2019.
Scottish lawmakers opposed to Brexit filed a petition to the Court of Session, Scotland's highest court, last year. 
They represent electoral areas in Scotland which voted strongly to remain in the EU in the June 2016 referendum. The United Kingdom as a whole voted to leave.
The Scottish National Party, the strongest political party north of the border, has opposed leaving the bloc. 
Given the urgency of the Brexit deadline the ECJ hopes to make a decision on the case before Christmas, sources close to the case told Reuters. 
The government could in theory have presented an appeal to this stage of the process, but have not done so.
""This ship sailed yesterday - when the reference was sent to Luxembourg - and the government wasn't on it,"" Jo Maugham, a lawyer who is funding the Scottish lawmakers, said on Twitter.
""We believe it's now too late."" 
The Scottish petitioners argue that legal certainty about the process is needed in advance of any British parliamentary vote on an EU withdrawal deal because no country has ever before withdrawn from the European Union.

Brexit supporters say that after the vote to leave, any attempt to halt the process would be anti-democratic. But opponents say the country should have a right to pass final judgment on any exit deal negotiated, and the Scottish challenge is one of the most robust legal challenges to it so far.

PARIS (Reuters) - French forces carried out air strikes in northern Burkina Faso on Wednesday night after dozens of Islamist fighters attacked a police unit at a local gold mine, the latest incident to underscore rising insurgency in the region.
West Africa's arid Sahel region is suffering a spike in violence by militant groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State, highlighting the difficulty international partners face in restoring regional stability.
The Burkinabe Ministry of Security said one gendarme was killed and another wounded in an attack on police at the Inata gold mine in the northern Soum region carried out by a large group of heavily armed terrorists.
France's army said in statement that at the request of the local authorities its forces intervened to hunt down the attackers. It dispatched a Reaper drone and two Mirage fighter jets from a base in neighboring Niger. 
""The drone detected a column of several motorcycles leaving the area in the direction of the north. After observing the group and establishing its terrorist nature, both Mirage planes carried out strikes,"" the statement said.
An army spokesman said some 15 motorcycles had been targeted, but it was too early to say how many fighters had been killed. 
Former colonial power France intervened in Mali in 2013 to drive out Islamist militants that had occupied the north and has since kept about 4,500 troops in the region as part of counter-terrorism operations. French officials acknowledge Paris is likely to remain in the zone for the next decade. 
No group claimed Wednesday's attack, but the province of Soum is known to be an area where Ansarul Islam, a jihadi Salafist group, operates.
The northern region of Burkina Faso, bordering Mali and Niger, has been the theater of many jihadist attacks since 2015. 
""It is a threat that could potentially extend across the region,"" said a French army spokesman. ""We are here to help when necessary.""
Led by France, Western powers have provided funding to a regional force made up of soldiers from Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania to combat jihadists.
But the so-called G5 force has been hobbled by delays in disbursing the money and poor coordination between the five countries while insecurity has escalated in the border region between Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions against a Turkish-based company, its top directors, and a North Korean diplomat, accusing them of trading in weapons and luxury goods with Pyongyang in violation of international sanctions.
The latest sanctions come as Washington maintains pressure on Pyongyang to dismantle its missile and nuclear programs. U.S. sanctions have targeted North Korea's trade routes in an effort to choke off funding for the weapons programs. 
The U.S. Treasury said in a statement that SIA Falcon International Group, which also has a branch in Latvia, would be blacklisted for exporting weapons into or from North Korea.
It also listed SIA Falcon Chief Executive Huseyin Sahin and its general manager, Erhan Culha, for having ""acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly SIA Falcon.""
Additionally, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on Ri Song Un, the economic and commercial counselor at North Korea's embassy in Mongolia. It said SIA Falcon officials hosted Ri earlier this year in Turkey to negotiate weapons deals with him.
Calls to SIA Falcon's offices in Istanbul seeking comment went unanswered, and calls to its office in Latvia were met with a pre-recorded message in Arabic.
""SIA Falcon International Group and individuals acting on its behalf are blatantly attempting to flout longstanding UN sanctions on trade in weapons and luxury goods with North Korea,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
The company's operations span defense, livestock, energy and food products, according to the SIA Falcon website. It described itself as ""one of the biggest companies ... in the defense industry,"" saying it supplied armed services and security forces of more than 30 nations on five continents.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo heads to Pyongyang on Sunday to resume negotiations with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on dismantling the country's missile and nuclear programs.
Part of the talks will focus on a second summit between Kim and President Donald Trump, possibly later this year.

The two leaders met in Singapore in June, where Kim pledged to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. His actions, however, have fallen short of Washington's demands for irreversible steps to give up an arsenal that potentially threatens the United States.

30,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>","Bosnia's election campaign plagued by abuses, hate speech: monitor","SARAJEVO (Reuters) - The run-up to Bosnia's Oct. 7 election has seen an unprecedented spate of campaigning violations, abuse of public funds and hate speech, anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International (TI) said on Thursday.
The campaign has been awash with the sort of divisive ethnic rhetoric that helped trigger Bosnia's 1992-95 war, raising doubt whether the country will be able to pursue a path toward European Union and NATO membership after the vote.
Officials in the main Serb, Croat, and Bosniak Muslim parties have also sought to ""buy"" votes from public employees by opening new public roads and offering free medical check-ups, and threatening those who reject the blandishments, the Bosnian branch of Transparency International said in a report.
""Party functions have totally merged with public functions,"" said TI Bosnia program manager Ivana Korajlic, adding that there had not been such a blatantly dirty election campaign since the 1990s war. 
""The abuses have been conducted in the most open manner ever. Direct threats and attacks, pressures on voters and vote-buying, which in the past had been somehow subtle, have become fully transparent. There are no attempts even to conceal them.""
She said that in just 25 days, Bosnian Serb separatist leader Milorad Dodik laid cornerstones for six public buildings, opened an artificial lake, a bridge, a factory, a hospital wing and a highway, and took political credit for all of them.
Dodik, who is running for the Serb seat in Bosnia's inter-ethnic presidency, has also declared that one-off payments to pensioners in Bosnia's autonomous Serb Republic (RS), where he rules, was a sweetener for voters ahead of the election. 
Dodik has further told employees in a public company that they would lose their jobs if they cast vote for his political rival, the TI's Korajlic said, and used crude language to attack rival political moderates and Western diplomats.
""Don't any of you who is employed in Gacko dare to vote for Govedarica, we will kick you out of your jobs,"" Dodik said at a rally in the eastern town of Gacko. He was referring to political rival Vukota Govedarica, head of the opposition SDS, which is part of Bosnia's weak federal government.
On Thursday, Bosnia's election commission fined Dodik and his SNSD party 6,000 euros ($6,912.60) for hate speech. 
Korajlic said that Bosniak and Croat officials have also abused their public jobs to campaign for their parties. 
Korajlic also said public broadcasters had become mouthpieces of the dominant nationalist parties, underlining the case of RS television in particular.
""This has grown to abnormal proportions in the sense of labeling people, calling for aggression, invoking hatred not only towards political opponents but also civic (democracy) activists. ""A very hostile atmosphere has been created...""
Bosnia will hold presidential and parliamentary elections on Sunday after a campaign marred by reports of irregularities including fraudulent voter lists. A lack of reliable polls and accusations of electoral fraud and irregularities ahead of the vote are making predictions of the outcome difficult.

Dodik has been campaigning for greater autonomy and eventual secession of the RS, while Bosnian Croat leader Dragan Covic has called for the creation of a separate Croat-run region.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union negotiators see the outline of a compromise on the Irish border issue which is holding up Brexit talks, EU sources told Reuters on Thursday, raising hopes that a new British offer could unlock a deal. 
Prime Minister Theresa May has promised new proposals and sketchy details seen so far have found a tentative welcome in Brussels as the sides push for a deal with 176 days to Brexit.
""This is a step in the right direction,"" said one EU source close to the negotiations. ""It makes finding a compromise possible."" 
A second source said EU negotiator Michel Barnier was looking at where the bloc could make improvements to what it has offered London as both sides race to overcome the remaining obstacles to a Brexit deal before a high-stakes EU summit on Oct. 17-18.
""We are definitely engaging with Britain"" on ways to break the deadlock over what is known as the ""Irish backstop"", said an EU diplomat following the negotiations.
Barnier himself said negotiations were in their final stages and the EU was working ""hand-in-hand"" with the Irish government.
""To agree to any deal, we need to have a legally sound backstop solution for Ireland and Northern Ireland,"" Barnier said after meeting Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar.
Britain has yet to formally deliver its new ideas, Varadkar said, notably about a fall-back option to keep the whole of the United Kingdom in a customs union with the EU. 
Varadkar said Dublin was open in principle to anything that helps escape extensive Irish border checks but voiced caution on an all-UK customs union, which the EU has once rejected before. 
The EU is insisting on a ""backstop"" clause in any withdrawal treaty to avoid erecting border posts between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland if London and Brussels cannot agree a trade pact for the future.
A seamless border is part of the settlement which largely ended decades of violence in the province. 
Signals that the EU was willing to engage with the new plan taking shape in London sent the pound rising against the dollar. 
Varadkar also met EU summit chair Donald Tusk in Brussels.
Tusk urged May to put a round of angry rhetoric behind and get down to sealing an agreement that would preserve peace in Ireland and open the way to a post-Brexit relationship he called ""Canada plus plus plus"" -- combining free trade deal like the one agreed with Canada with close security, global affairs, research and other cooperation.
Another senior EU diplomat said the bloc's offer was to have ""zero tariffs and zero quotas"" in UK trade after Brexit. 
TIGHT TIMING
EU diplomats and officials described an emerging new proposal under which Britain would agree to an indefinite border backstop solution, a commitment missing in London's previous proposal rejected by the remaining 27 EU states last June. 
But Britain would stick to its line that, if the backstop was triggered, the whole of the United Kingdom would stay in a customs union with the EU. That would mean having the same external tariff on some goods, as the EU currently has with Turkey, and curb Britain's ability to strike trade deals with other countries. 
Under the British proposal described by EU sources, that would remove the need for customs checks on goods and agriculture on the island of Ireland.
While Varadkar has not ruled that out point-blank, he told a Brussels news conference: ""There would be constraints. A lot of countries would take the view that any UK-wide arrangement is really a matter for future relations rather than a backstop which is about Ireland and Northern Ireland,"" he said.
The EU has feared such an arrangement could allow Britain to use Northern Ireland's special access to the bloc's single market to push goods that did not conform to high EU norms, and hence be sold cheaper. 
For separate regulatory checks, Britain would agree to simplified, light controls on goods going from the British mainland to Northern Ireland that would be carried out away from the actual border as much as possible, according to EU sources describing the emerging proposal. 
That is difficult for May, whose government relies on the support of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party which vehemently opposes differing rules on its soil from the rest of the United Kingdom. Barnier is due to meet the DUP head Arlene Foster next week.
EU and Britain are seeking ""decisive progress"" on the Irish issue in time for a leaders summit due Oct.17-18 and then a final deal, including a blueprint of future relations, at another one in mid-November. 

Should they succeed, Britain would get a status-quo transition period after Brexit until the end of 2020. Should they fail, London faces crashing out of the bloc next March with little to replace four decades of closest cooperation from trade to security to air traffic.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - The best way to resolve Yemen's humanitarian crisis is to fix the economy so stemming a slide in the riyal currency is the top international priority, the U.N. special envoy said on Thursday.
Martin Griffiths said the United Nations is discussing an emergency plan to stem the riyal's fall and restore economic confidence. Yemen is one of the poorest Arab nations and faces the world's worst humanitarian crisis, exacerbated by a war that begin in 2015.
Three-quarters of its population, or 22 million people, require aid and 8.4 million people are on the brink of starvation.
""There's no doubt in my mind whatsoever that this economic issue is now the overwhelmingly most important priority,"" envoy Martin Griffiths told Reuters.
""Within the U.N. we're talking about the need for such a master plan ... an immediate set of measures over weeks which the World Bank, IMF, UN agencies, the Gulf obviously, the government of Yemen could come together to discuss,"" he said.
The riyal has lost more than half its value against the U.S. dollar since the start of the war. Authorities sought to boost liquidity last year by printing money, but it plunged from 250 to the dollar after the first batch of notes was rolled out. It was trading at around 700 on Thursday.
Soaring prices have put some basic commodities out of reach for many Yemenis and the central bank has struggled to pay public-sector salaries on which many depend as foreign exchange reserves dwindle.
Griffiths said that by November the United Nations hopes to resume consultations with the warring sides. These are the Houthis who are aligned with Iran and the internationally-recognized government, which is backed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the West.
The first attempt in three years at talks collapsed a month ago after the Houthis failed to turn up.
The Houthis, who control northern Yemen and the capital Sanaa, accused the coalition of blocking their delegation from traveling to Geneva. The government blamed the Houthis for sabotaging the negotiations.
CENTRAL BANK
Griffiths, who took up his post in March, said he was close to securing a solution in order to avoid more ""last minute surprises"".
""What I'd like to see happen is within the next couple of weeks maximum we could have resolved those issues so that we can then say, 'OK, we now know the logistical basis that we have, let's go back to the table,"" he said in the Emirati capital Abu Dhabi.
""I'd like it to happen in November but I'm not predicting at the moment because we've got to get these logistical issues out of the way."" He said the talks would probably happen in Europe but declined to confirm a specific location.
The coalition intervened in Yemen's war against the Houthis in 2015 with the aim of restoring the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. 
Saudi Arabia donated $200 million to Yemen's central bank this week to help shore up the riyal, following earlier deposits of nearly $3 billion, but Griffiths said a more comprehensive approach was needed.
""I don't think we can always rely and shouldn't always rely on Saudi generosity to put money into the system,"" he said.
The central bank has been considered the last bastion of Yemen's financial system, and is effectively running the economy, according to central bank officials, diplomats and Yemeni political sources on both sides of the war.
Hadi’s government moved it from Sanaa to Aden in 2016, placing it in the crossfire. The government has accused the Houthis of squandering some $4 billion in reserves on the war effort, but the Houthis say the funds were used to finance imports of food and medicine.
Griffiths said the U.N. and International Monetary Fund were working to reunite the rival branches and de-politicize their activities within two weeks, though he gave no details.

Duterte has disappeared from public view before. He was not seen for a week last year, fuelling speculation he was ill. The government insisted then the speculation was baseless. 
But this was the first time he seemed to confirm he might have health problems.
""I don't know where I'm now physically, but I have to wait for that,"" Duterte told a dinner he hosted for soldiers and police officers at the presidential palace, in a speech that was televised nationally.
""But, I will tell you if its cancer, it's cancer. If it's third stage, no more treatment. I will not prolong the agony in this office or anywhere.""
Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea confirmed the president underwent a colonoscopy on Wednesday, a procedure the president ""submits to on a yearly basis"". He underwent the same test three weeks ago, but his doctors wanted to get more tissue samples, Duterte said. 
But presidential spokesman Harry Roque told a news briefing early Thursday Duterte got tired and took a day off, denying rumors he had been admitted to a hospital.
Known for a busy schedule and long speeches, often several a day, the 73-year-old Duterte's frequent disappearances have fueled rumors he is in declining health and that the government is trying to keep that under wraps.
After a trip to Israel and Jordan last month, Duterte said his skin was burned by his long exposure to desert sun when the public notice discoloration in his face.

Before addressing Congress in late July, Duterte also made a routine check at a hospital and his aides were quick to say there was nothing wrong with his health.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - ""Hadah?"" ""Hadila?"" ""Andrade?"" When Fernando Haddad took over the Workers Party's presidential ticket, replacing its jailed founder, the former Sao Paulo mayor heard a host of creative pronunciations from supporters who had never heard his name.
Yet voters understood what the stand-in for former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva represented as he took center stage in the final weeks before Sunday's election in Brazil: ""Haddad is Lula! Lula is Haddad!"" his campaign slogan declared.
The message helped him surge in opinion polls to challenge right-wing front-runner Jair Bolsonaro, whom he is expected to face in a second-round runoff later this month. 
(GRAPHIC: Polling, issues and leading candidates in Brazil's election - https://tmsnrt.rs/2Ixe0NI)
Promising to make ""Brazil happy again,"" 55-year-old Haddad has played to the nostalgia of working-class Brazilians whose standard of living rose sharply a decade ago thanks to Lula's generous social programs amid a global commodities boom.
The message has connected with poorer voters in Workers Party bastions such as northeast Brazil, even if they struggle with his name of Lebanese origin. 
Yet he faces a backlash from Brazilians blaming Lula and the Workers Party for rampant corruption and a deep economic downturn after running the country for 13 of the last 15 years.
Haddad's challenge will be to shed the image of Lula's pawn, cope with party leaders skeptical of his rise and convince voters he can avoid the economic missteps of recent years and the graft scandals that stain Lula's legacy.
A mild-mannered law professor with an economics degree and only one electoral victory to his name, Haddad has begun working to calm investors scarred by the public spending spree under Lula's last handpicked successor, Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached in 2016 for breaking budget rules.
In August, Haddad told Reuters he was meeting with several banks and investment firms to tame fears of a leftist return to power — an echo of Lula's move toward the center in 2002 when he won his first term after pledging orthodox economic policies.
Financial analysts said investors found him more open than they had expected and more reasonable than the Workers Party as a whole, though concerns remain over a leftist turn in policies. 
""Haddad is moving toward the center economically and we can expect a government that is closer to Lula's first term administration than to Dilma Rousseff's in terms of economic orthodoxy,"" said Fabio Knijnik, a Stanford-trained economist and managing director for Sao Paulo-based wealth fund K2 Capital.
ROUSSEFF CRITIC
Haddad, who served as education minister under Lula and rode his mentor's popularity to Sao Paulo City Hall, has publicly criticized certain Rousseff policies that economists fault for deepening Brazil's worst recession in a generation.
In a magazine article last year, he questioned her efforts to contain inflation by holding down costs of public services such as electricity rates and gasoline prices. 
""Something was very wrong. No one thinks of controlling inflation of a continental-sized country by holding back municipal tariffs,"" Haddad wrote in Piaui magazine. ""Macroeconomic stability cannot be achieved through microeconomic intervention.""
Haddad's 2016 mayoral re-election bid met with a stunning first-round defeat but he boasts of leaving Brazil's biggest city with funds for long-term investment, a restructured debt load and investment grade from international ratings agencies.
Knijnik said Haddad would move further to the center ahead of a second-round vote and could pick an economist at odds with many in the Workers Party without losing the party's base.
The market expects Haddad to stay close to current economic advisor Marcos Lisboa, who is well respected by investors.
Haddad has also said he would respect concessions signed with foreign oil companies to develop vast offshore oil fields rather than tear them up as leftist rivals and many in his party have proposed.
Samuel Pessoa, an economist who has known Haddad since they studied together at university, said the former mayor had little in common with the more militant left-wing factions of his party, known as the PT for its initials in Portuguese.
""He is very different from the PT. Fernando is a democrat and not an adventurer,"" Pessoa said.
While Haddad and his party call for abolishing labor reforms enacted after Rousseff was ousted in 2016, his proposals to overhaul Brazil's costly pension system to bring down a gaping budget deficit could meet with resistance from fellow partisans.
Haddad accepts the need to create a minimum retirement age, which is anathema to the party, and he recently said ""nothing is taboo"" when it comes to reforms, shocking party leaders who distrust his more orthodox approach to economic policy.
LULA'S LAWYER
Long considered Lula's golden boy, the key test of Haddad's independence if elected may be whether he can resist pressure in the party to free his mentor, who is serving a more than 12-year prison sentence for his role in a graft scheme involving contracts at state oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA. 
Haddad has vowed there is no way he would pardon Lula.
Still, he remains a member of Lula's legal team, paying weekly visits to the former president in his prison cell and advocating for his freedom in Brazilian courts and international forums. He describes Lula as a key advisor but denied the jailed leader would have any role in his government if he is elected.
""The ideas that I defend have been discussed with Lula and have his endorsement,"" Haddad told Reuters in an interview. Haddad drafted his party's platform for Lula and was considered a candidate for finance minister if the former president had been allowed to run.
Those close to Haddad say despite his loyalty to Lula, the two have had their differences, including key appointments during his time as education minister. Haddad's friction with the rest of the party has been even more acute.
The best known incident came shortly after he became mayor of Sao Paulo, when Rousseff called him to Brasilia and asked him to put off a planned hike to city bus fares, needed to shrink its budget deficit. Haddad proposed using a federal fuel tax to subsidize bus fares, which Rousseff denied.
Haddad held out until May before budget constraints forced him to hike bus fares, triggering huge street protests that spread to the rest of the country, in the biggest wave of unrest seen in Brazil since the end of military rule in 1985.

In an unexpected twist, the protest movement eventually provided the popular momentum that would underpin Rousseff's impeachment in 2016.

""No child in this country is without a book,"" Malawi's Education Minister Bright Msaka told the first lady.
The first lady heads to Kenya later on Thursday and then stops in Egypt on Saturday before returning to the United States.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo has accused the European Union of interfering in its upcoming presidential election by not heeding Kinshasa's call to lift sanctions on President Joseph Kabila's hand-picked candidate, letters from his lawyers show. 
The candidate, Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, was interior minister during violent crackdowns on protesters demonstrating against Kabila's refusal to step down when his second elected term expired in December 2016. 
The EU imposed sanctions on Ramazani and 15 others for what it said were rights violations and interference in the election process, and is due to vote on whether to renew those sanctions on Dec. 12. DRC's presidential election is on Dec. 23. 
In a series of letter to the Council of the European Union between Sept. 10-28 seen by Reuters, lawyers representing 15 of the officials under sanctions said Kabila's decision in August not seek a third term had rendered the sanctions moot and called them ""blatant interference"" in the electoral process.
""By maintaining restrictive measures against Mr. Ramazani Shadary, a candidate in the presidential election, the Council has permitted itself to take a position in the internal democratic debate in Congo,"" the lawyers wrote.
Renewal requires a unanimous vote from the EU member states, some of whom have been reluctant in the past to impose sanctions. Congo's government says the sanctions are unjustified and illegal -- a position backed by the African Union.
One of the lawyers, Thierry Bontinck, told Reuters they had filed a challenge on behalf of the 15 officials to the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second highest.
They include government spokesman Lambert Mende, intelligence chief Kalev Mutond and army inspector general John Numbi. 
Bontinck said he had since exchanged memos with the court, but declined to elaborate. 
An EU official speaking on condition of anonymity said in response that the Council could not comment on correspondences with individuals but it always carefully considers objections to sanctions. 
Kabila's decision not to run in December has cleared the way for what could be Congo's first democratic transition after decades marked by autocratic rule, coups and rebellions.

The service member, assigned to NATO's Resolute Support training and advisory mission, was not identified. The statement said the incident was under investigation.
At least six U.S. servicemen have been killed in Afghanistan this year in combat incidents or insider attacks by members of the Afghan forces. The Pentagon says there are about 14,000 U.S. service members in Afghanistan.
The U.S. military mission in Afghanistan is focused mainly on guiding and aiding Afghan forces, and also fighting extremist groups including Islamic State’s affiliate in the country's east.

MIHATOVICI, Bosnia (Reuters) - Edis Haskic has been living in a reception center since 1995, when Bosnian Serb forces killed his father and 8,000 other Muslim Bosniak men and boys in the eastern town of Srebrenica in Europe's worst atrocity since World War Two.
He shares the destiny of more than 7,000 people from across Bosnia's ethnic divide, still displaced from the 1992-95 war and residing in 120 such shelters.
Their fate is not high on the agenda of Bosnian politicians whose campaigning for Oct. 7 general elections is characterized by ethnically divisive rhetoric and opposing views of Bosnia's future - the very issues at the core of the war in which 100,000 people were killed and two million driven from their homes.
Waiting for the state to assign him a new home, Haskic, 33, got married in the northern village of Mihatovici and is now trying to raise his own children with monthly state aid of 60 euros. He is forced to seek daily jobs to help make ends meet. 
""Politicians are guilty for this situation because, apart from free meals, no other chance or help was given to me,"" he said, adding he has lost hope of ever returning to Srebrenica.
The 1995 Dayton peace deal ended the war by splitting Bosnia into two distinct regions - the Serb Republic and the Bosniak-Croat Federation - but ethnic tensions remain high, blocking progress toward membership of NATO and the European Union.
Muslim Bosniak children and Roman Catholic Croats attend the same schools but still learn from different curricula - a practice devised as an interim solution after the war that has persisted despite a top court ruling it as discriminatory.
""The politicians are guilty for everything. They are the ones who divide us,"" said Rasko Kovacevic, a Serb from a camp in the northern village of Kladari Donji, where life is far from easy. 
Most families have only one room in which they sleep, prepare meals and even take baths. Many can use only makeshift wooden toilets shared by a dozen of people.
""They (politicians) only visit us before the elections when they need a vote but when I'm looking for a job, they just tap me on my shoulder,"" said Branko Mlikota, who lives in the Croat center outside the southern town of Capljina for 24 years.
After many delays, the government has set a 2020 deadline for the closure of these centers. ""They just promise but nobody has ever done anything for us,"" one refugee said.

Bosnians vote for a new presidency, national and regional parliaments on Oct. 7 in elections dominated by public frustration with the failure of authorities to tackle rampant corruption and sky-high unemployment.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Thursday that Russia's violation of an arms control treaty was ""untenable"" and unless it changed course the United States would respond.
The United States believes Russia is developing a ground-launched system in breach of a Cold War treaty, known as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), that could allow Moscow to launch a nuclear strike on Europe at short notice. Russia has consistently denied any such violation.
""Russia must return to compliance with the INF treaty or the U.S. will need to respond to its cavalier disregard to the treaty's specific limits,"" Mattis told a news conference after a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels.
""The United States is reviewing options in our diplomacy and defense posture to do just that. Make no mistake: The current situation, with Russia in blatant violation of this treaty, is untenable,"" Mattis said. 
He declined to give details on the possible U.S. response.
The 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty bans medium-range missiles capable of hitting Europe or Alaska and ended a Cold War-era crisis, when the Soviet Union installed nearly 400 nuclear warheads pointed at western Europe.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Moscow had developed a missile known as Novator 9M729, which analysts say is similar to Russian short-range, sea-launched missiles but can fly between 500 km to 5,500 km (310-3,420 miles). 
Mattis' comments are likely to worsen relations between Moscow and the West, already at a post-Cold War low over Russia's 2014 seizure of Crimea, its bombing campaign in Syria and accusations of meddling in Western elections.
While the United States has called for Russia to come back into compliance with the INF treaty for several years, Mattis' comments come just days after Washington's envoy to NATO said Russia must halt its covert development of the banned cruise missile system or the United States would seek to destroy it before it becomes operational.
U.S. ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison said on Tuesday Washington remained committed to a diplomatic solution but was prepared to ""take out"" any Russian missile if development of the medium-range system continued.
The Russian foreign ministry reacted by saying Hutchison's comments were dangerous. Hutchison clarified that she was not talking about a preemptive strike against Russia.
U.S. STARTING MISSILE RESEARCH 
The top U.S. general in Europe said the United States needed to make strong statements on Russia's violation. 
""We also will take the steps necessary to ensure that we don't have any gaps in a credible defense and deterrence posture,"" General Curtis Scaparrotti, head of U.S. European Command and NATO's supreme allied commander, told reporters during the NATO meeting. 
A recent U.S. State Department report found Russia had violated obligations ""not to possess, produce, or flight-test"" a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km (310-3,420 miles), ""or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles"".
Earlier this year, the U.S. military said in a new national defense strategy that countering Russia, along with China, would be a priority. The move reflects shifting U.S. priorities after more than a decade and a half of focusing on the fight against Islamist militants.
The Pentagon's nuclear policy document released in February said that in response to Russia's violation, the United States would start reviewing its own options for conventional, ground-launched, intermediate-range missile systems. 
Kingston Reif, the director for disarmament research at the Arms Control Association advocacy group, cautioned that if the United States also abandoned the INF treaty, it would allow Russia to potentially station hundreds of missiles near Europe.

Any new U.S. missile system would also be politically difficult to station in Europe as no NATO ally would want to host it, he said. ""Attempting to force it upon the alliance would be incredibly divisive. It is thus a weapon to nowhere.""

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) directed its partners working in northwest Syria to immediately cease all use of the Bab al-Hawa border crossing for USAID-funded awards on Sept. 26, a USAID official said.
USAID had received information that jihadist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham was likely drawing financial benefits from trucks crossing through the border, the official said.
Likewise, Britain's Department for International Development (DFID) directed its aid partners to stop using the crossing, a UK government source said, citing concerns that levies were being paid to extremist groups in exchange for allowing aid trucks to pass.
Tahrir al-Sham, the main jihadist group in the Idlib region, is designated a terrorist organisation by the United Nations, the United States and Turkey. Bab al-Hawa is the only official border crossing connecting Turkey to the Idlib region, where an estimated 2.1 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Some 2,284 trucks carrying aid went through the crossing in the first eight months of this year, according to David Swanson of the United Nation's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
The Bab al-Salama border crossing from Turkey into Aleppo province, also used by USAID partners for humanitarian shipments, will not be impacted, the U.S. official said. Only 428 trucks passed through Bab al-Salama in the first eight months of this year.
The Syrian Salvation Government, an administration set up to run civilian affairs in opposition-held Idlib, on Saturday said the collection of fees on trucks delivering humanitarian aid would be stopped from this month.
But the aid convoys have yet to resume. Britain is currently reviewing its decision, the UK government source said, while the USAID official did not comment on whether the decision is under review following the Salvation Government statement.
""We hope that the convoys with life-saving assistance will be able to resume without delay to avoid any break in supporting the 3 million people who live in the area,"" OCHA's Swanson said.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan has ordered 18 international aid groups to shut down operations and leave the country, a spokeswoman for ActionAid said on Thursday, the latest move against foreign aid groups in the country. 
ActionAid, which focuses on education, poverty alleviation and human rights and is headquartered in Johannesburg, said it had received an expulsion notice from Pakistan's Ministry of Interior, but a statement from the group did not say whether the ministry gave any reason for its decision.
The ActionAid statement called the move ""an attack on civil society and human rights organizations"".
A UK-based spokeswoman for ActionAid told Reuters that 17 other foreign-funded aid groups had received similar notifications but would not give their names.
Pakistan's interior ministry did not respond to messages asking about the expulsion orders, and the information ministry said it would check on the matter.
The new round of expulsion orders comes amidst complaints by journalists and editors of increasing constraints on press freedom, continuing what rights campaigners have termed an attack on free expression and activism in the Pakistan. 
Pakistan has been clamping down on foreign-funded aid groups for several years, with one shutdown notice last year accusing a group of ""pursuing (an) anti-state agenda"".
In December, the previous government of the then-ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) issued expulsion notices to 27 international aid groups, mostly those working on human rights issues.
That list also included ActionAid, which appealed the notice, and it was unclear how many of the new expulsion list were also on the previous list of 27. 
""The immediate victims will be the thousands of ordinary Pakistani families who ActionAid has been supporting to claim their rights and build a better life,"" ActionAid said in a statement.
""Pakistan's decision to shut down ActionAid and other International NGOs is a worrying escalation of recent attacks on civil society, academics and journalists,"" it said.

WANI, Indonesia (Reuters) - Ship's engineer Charles Marlan had the unsettling sensation his vessel was being sucked out to sea, the telltale sign of an imminent tsunami, just minutes after a major earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
His passenger and cargo vessel, the 500-tonne KM Sabuk Nusantara 39, was docked in Wani, east of the city of Palu, which suffered the brunt of the disaster.
""The whole ship was shaking, everything in our bunks started falling,"" Marlan said.
The ship was picked up by the tsunami rushing in from the sea and slammed onto land, crashing into a dockside settlement.
And that's where it lies, high and dry, nearly a week after the earthquake and tsunami devastated the area, killing at least 1,424 people.
Marlan and his fellow crewmen knew they were in trouble when they felt the ship being pulled back out to sea from the dock, as the sea receded, heralding the arrival of a tsunami.
They had no sooner scrambled into life jackets when a five-meter wave bore down on them.
""I could hear the waves coming,"" Marlan said, describing how he was gripped by fear.
""The waves carried us very fast and before we knew it, we were sitting on land,” he said in an interview aboard the ship, which sits balanced precariously, its propeller and rudder exposed, hanging dusty meters above the ground.
No one on the boat was hurt.
Now Marlan and 20 crewmen are stranded, awaiting a decision on what should be done from the national ferry operator, which owns the vessel.
They survive on handouts from passing ferries and while away the time, attending a roll-call every now and then and chatting with neighborhood kids who climb up on board.
Marlan said he was thankful his ship had not killed anyone when it was hurled onto the land, as far as they knew.

""What is important is we are alive and for that we should be grateful.""

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Dutch authorities disrupted an attempt in April by Russian intelligence agents to hack the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Defence Minister Ank Bijleveld said on Thursday.
At a news conference in The Hague, Bijleveld called on Russia to cease its cyber activities aimed at ""undermining"" Western democracies.
She noted that the U.S. Department of Justice is expected to issue indictments of suspected Russian spies later on Thursday, in part due to information gleaned from the Dutch operation.
According to a presentation by the head of the Netherlands' military intelligence agency, four Russians arrived in the Netherlands on April 10 and were caught on the 13th with spying equipment at a hotel next to the OPCW headquarters.
The men were not successful in breaching OPCW systems, the minister said.
At a presentation, Dutch Major General Onno Eichelsheim showed the antennae, laptops and other equipment the men intended to use to breach the OPCW's wifi network. He said the spies were caught red-handed and attempted to destroy some of their own equipment to conceal what they had been doing.
At the time, the OPCW was working to verify the identity of the substance used in the March attack in Salisbury, Britain, on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. It was also seeking to verify the identity of a substance used in an attack in Douma, Syria.
The four Russians in the Netherlands were detained in April and expelled to Russia and not immediately prosecuted because the operation was considered military, not police, Eichelsheim said. 
The men, who were also believed to have spied on the investigation into the 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 had planned to travel on from the Netherlands to a laboratory in Spiez, Switzerland used by the OPCW to analyze chemical weapons samples, he said.
They were instead ""put on a flight to Moscow,"" said Bijleveld.
Eichelsheim warned against being naive and considering the Netherlands as relatively safe from Russian cyber attacks.

Russian military intelligence ""is active here in the Netherlands ... where a lot of international organizations are (based),"" Eichelsheim said.

YAOUNDE (Reuters) - It was the nine corpses left by the roadside after a gunfight that made Honrne Waba flee her village in Northwest Cameroon in May and hide in the bush. 
When weeks later she learned that her house had been burned down with all her belongings inside, she decided to leave the region altogether. 
""I felt so scared, I had a broken heart and I said I had to leave,"" Waba, 40, told Reuters in the narrow courtyard of her daughter's house in the capital Yaounde, where she has been staying for a month since leaving her home village of Njinikom. 
Waba is one of tens of thousands of Cameroonians displaced by a separatist insurgency in the English-speaking Northwest and Southwest regions who find themselves without a home and with nowhere to vote in Sunday's presidential election. 
Even those still in Anglophone areas will struggle to reach a ballot box: armed separatist groups have vowed to stop the election from happening there, potentially silencing up to five million English-speaking voters in the majority French-speaking country of about 24 million. 
The chaos in Anglophone opposition strongholds may help Cameroon's 85-year-old President Paul Biya, who is expected to easily win a seventh term to extend his 36 years in office, aided in part by a weak opposition and a resigned population, many of whom view elections as a means to rubber-stamp seven more years of Biya. 
Victory would leave Biya as one of Africa's last strongmen, vestige of a post-colonial era that a wave of democracy has slowly eroded. During his tenure, neighboring Nigeria has had nine different presidents; the only current African president to have ruled longer is Equatorial Guinea's Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. 
The level of neglect across Cameroon has caused a ""groundswell of discontent"" directed at the president, said opposition candidate Akere Muna. However, if Anglophones cannot vote ""the irony is that the secessionists may be helping Biya"". 
In the Simbock neighborhood of Yaounde, where small concrete houses creep haphazardly up one of the city's many lush, steep hillsides, displaced Anglophones say they have more pressing concerns than who will win the election. 
Waba brought her voting card with her from the Northwest, but four days before the election she was not registered to vote in Yaounde and was unsure if it was even possible.
She is more worried about how to make ends meet now that she cannot sow corn, beans and other vegetables at her farm at home.
""We are not managing very well in Yaounde. Food is very expensive. I sleep on the floor now,"" said Waba as she prepared a cloudy cow-skin broth over a charcoal stove. ""I used to do my farming, I used to send my children to school."" 
NOT ENOUGH ROOM 
It is unclear how this kind of hardship will play out at the ballot box. 
Biya rules the cocoa- and oil-producing country essentially by decree. His popularity has been largely unaffected by the long stretches he spends abroad in Swiss hotels with his fashion-conscious wife, Chantal, whose flamboyantly coiffed strawberry bouffant has made her instantly recognizable. 
He is still considered by many as the ""force of experience"" touted by election campaign posters across the capital. 
Still, the Anglophone crisis is his gravest threat yet. What began as a peaceful movement in 2016 calling for broader recognition of Anglophone teachers and lawyers has opened a deep wound in Cameroon. 
For ten years after the French- and English-speaking regions joined together in 1961, the country was a federation in which the Anglophone regions had their own police, government and judicial system. 
Since then, Anglophone autonomy has declined and English speakers have felt marginalized. Today, the governors of the Southwest and Northwest are Francophone, as are prefects of most English-speaking districts. 
A government crackdown on protests against the marginalization of Anglophones since 2016 has killed dozens, bolstering support for radical elements calling for secession. 
Soldiers went into remote Anglophone villages, burning houses and killing residents, witnesses told Reuters. In retaliation, hundreds have taken up arms to form small militias, killing hundreds of soldiers and gendarmes. 
The military denies using excessive force and accuses the separatists of terrorism. 
""It is the separatists in this crisis who have gained most prominence and not enough room has been left for moderates,"" said Simon Munzu, a former United Nations official who has called for dialogue between the two sides. 
YOU HEAR GUNSHOTS
Displaced Anglophones in Yaounde all agree on one thing about the life they have fled: they were sick of the shooting. 
""You can be walking along, you hear gunshots and you see people running. You get inside, you dive on the floor,"" said 55-year-old Kum Rose, who in August left Bomaka in the Southwest, taking the bus with four children and 7 grandchildren. 
She managed to bring some pots, charcoal and palm oil for cooking but the tiny room where she sleeps with her whole family in a rundown house in Yaounde is no substitute for home. Rose proudly showed her voting card, kept dry in a red holder, but admitted she had no idea where to register in Yaounde.
Musician Rawlings Fofeyen, 23, left the Northwest city of Bamenda two weeks ago. He said the Cameroonian military routinely picked up young men on the streets, suspecting them of being separatist fighters. 
His money dried up when friends stopped coming to his studio to record music. He felt he could no longer stay when he saw a dead body in his neighborhood last month. 
""I have some friends who have gone and who I never saw again,"" he said. 
Bamenda has gone quiet, he said. Public spaces and markets are empty. 
""We used to be a happy people, very welcoming,"" he said, holding back tears. ""Now we don't trust anybody.""

Social media footage of the protest in Magas, the regional capital, showed several thousand people in the vicinity of the regional parliament, accompanied by the sound of security forces firing into the air to try to disperse the crowd.
The regional parliament on Thursday endorsed the new border deal agreed by the heads of Ingushetia and Chechnya, both majority Muslim regions, on Sept. 26.
The deal envisages a land swap meant to end simmering territorial tensions that emerged after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union.
Protesters in Ingushetia said they believed that the deal amounted to a surrender of territory and that the arrangement favored Chechnya at their own region's expense. 
Artyom Perekhrist, an adviser to Yunus-Bek Yevkurov, the head of Ingushetia, told Reuters that up to 10 of the protesters had accepted an invitation to discuss their concerns with the authorities and that the demonstration was thinning out.

Bulgaria fought on Nazi Germany's side in World War Two but then became a loyal Soviet satellite until the fall of communism in 1989.
In the post-communist era the 37-metre high monument, which depicts nine Soviet soldiers advancing against the enemy, has often been targeted by vandals.
In 2011, the soldiers were painted as American superheroes, prompting an official protest by the Russian embassy in Sofia. A year later, they were clothed in brightly covered balaclavas, similar to those worn by members of anti-Kremlin Russian punk band Pussy Riot.

The Russian foreign ministry has demanded that Norway lifts ""the absurd charges"" and releases Mikhail Bochkaryov, whom it identified as a staff member of the Russian parliament's upper house.
""My client disagrees with the decision, and has already appealed it to the higher court,"" his Norwegian lawyer, Hege Aakre, told Reuters.

Bochkaryov was detained on Sept. 21 at the Oslo airport before a flight out of the country after attending a seminar on digitalization at Norway's parliament, Stortinget.

The PST was not immediately available for comment.
Aakre said she expected the Borgarting Court of Appeals to hold a hearing on the grounds for continued detention on Friday or Monday at the latest.

52,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Saudis seek wide-ranging deals with South African arms firms,"By Joe Bavier
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is in talks with South Africa's major arms manufacturers and is considering taking an equity stake in the struggling state-owned defense firm Denel, the head of the Saudi state defense company told Reuters.
Saudi Arabian Military Industries' (SAMI) chief executive Andreas Schwer said he expected to conclude the first partnership deals with South African companies by the end of the year, though he would not identify those initial partners.
South Africa's Department of Public Enterprises, which oversees Denel, acknowledged the talks with SAMI but said it was too early to give details of any potential partnership arrangement.
The Paramount Group, a privately held South African company, has already said it is in talks with SAMI. 
""To make it clear, we are in discussions with all major South African companies, not only Paramount, not only Denel,"" Schwer said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. 
South Africa's defense industry once played a major role in the country's economy, but more recently it has suffered from the impact of a squeeze on defense spending globally and a weak home market.
Saudi Arabia is the world's third largest defense spender behind the United States and China with an estimated military budget last year of nearly $70 billion. 
Since 2015, the Gulf state has been fighting a war against the armed Houthi movement in Yemen in support of the internationally recognized government there.
With little local manufacturing capacity, however, it has long been forced to import the bulk of its military hardware. 
The Saudi government is now seeking to develop its own domestic defense industry with the goal of localizing half of its military spending by 2030. Schwer said SAMI aimed to have all its foreign partnerships in place by the end of next year.
""We are in discussions with the South African government in order to identify opportunities to set up strategic partnerships which could include an equity investment from our side into Denel. It's not decided yet, but it's one option,"" Schwer said.
STRUGGLING INDUSTRY
Over 60 percent of Denel's revenues come from exports. But the company has been grappling with a liquidity crunch after becoming embroiled in corruption scandals during the presidency of Jacob Zuma.
""We hope to get access to their technology. They have to commit to transfer their technology to Saudi Arabia and to build up together with us local capabilities, not only manufacturing but also engineering,"" Schwer said.
He said those same conditions would apply to all of SAMI's partners, and in return Saudi Arabia would offer preferred or exclusive market access to companies. 
Denel did not pay senior staff their salaries in full this month. Labor unions say it is critical that Denel receives financial support - either via additional government guarantees or a capital injection.
A Denel spokeswoman said she was not aware of the discussions with SAMI and the Saudi government. 
""Denel would welcome any country that looks at South Africa for procurement of defense material,"" the spokeswoman Vuyelwa Qinga, wrote in an emailed response to Reuters' questions. 
President Cyril Ramaphosa visited Saudi Arabia in July and subsequently announced that the Saudi government pledged to invest at least $10 billion in South Africa.
Department of Public Enterprises spokesman Adrian Lackay said there had been discussions between SAMI and various state bodies about Saudi Arabia's interest in defense technology. 
""But at this stage it would be premature and speculative for the DPE to attempt to provide details of any specific transactions,"" he said.
A United Nations arms embargo imposed on South Africa's apartheid government in 1977 forced the country to produce all its own military hardware.
By 1994 when Nelson Mandela was elected president, the industry employed over 100,000 people. But defense spending has steadily declined and just 15,000 work in the sector today, a trade association official said earlier this year.
""In the beginning, we will pump in lots of additional capacity into South Africa to expand the capabilities and capacities in order to serve our needs and, yes, progressively we will build up capabilities here in the kingdom,"" Schwer said.

The language of the Israeli military statement did not appear to herald any imminent offensive in Gaza but seemed to suggest stronger action at the frontier to foil any further Palestinian attempts to breach Israel's security fence during the demonstrations, which began in March.
Israel accuses Gaza's dominant Hamas Islamist group of inciting violence at the border, an allegation it denies. Hamas has controlled Gaza since 2007, during which time it has fought three wars with Israel, most recently in 2014.
Since the protests began in March at least 193 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, Gaza medics say. One Israeli soldier has been killed by a Palestinian sniper.
The protesters demand the easing of an Israeli-Egyptian blockade of the territory and rights to lands Palestinian families fled or were driven from on Israel’s founding in 1948.
The Israeli military said it ""decided on wide-scale reinforcements in the southern command in the coming days and the continuation of a determined policy to thwart terror activity and prevent infiltrations into Israel from the Gaza Strip"".
Commenting on the deployment, Tzachi Hanegbi, a non-voting member of Israel's security cabinet, told Israel Radio: ""Our wish is to prevent escalation. I hope that the other side has a similar desire.""
In an interview published on Thursday in Israel's Yedioth Ahronoth daily and Italy's la Repubblica newspaper, Hamas's Gaza-based leader Yehya Al-Sinwar was quoted as saying that ""a new war was not in anyone's interest"" but ""an explosion was unavoidable"" unless Gaza's ""siege"" was lifted.
Citing security concerns, Israel and Egypt maintain tight restrictions on the movement of people and goods along their borders with Egypt, a policy that the World Bank says has brought the enclave of 2 million people to economic collapse.
Hanegbi said Hamas, which is engaged with Egypt in efforts to achieve a long-term ceasefire with Israel, had ""gone back to its old ways"" in recent weeks by encouraging ""bombs, shooting and attempts to carry out terrorist attacks on the fence"".

""Therefore a mobilization of troops is really required,"" he said.

DAMASCUS (Reuters) - A stone image of an ancient priest is one of hundreds of stolen antiquities recovered by the Syrian government and put on display in Damascus this week, a reminder of the mass looting of Syria's heritage during seven years of war. 
It was carved for Yalhi bin Yalhabouda, a high priest in Palmyra, upon his death in 120 AD, his status apparent from his tall hat and laurel wreath. It was illegally dug up during Islamic State's occupation of the desert town. 
""This civilization is not only for Syria, but we are the custodians of it and we preserve it for the world,"" said Khalil Hariri, head of the Palmyra antiquities department. 
Syria stood at the heart of the ancient Middle East, a crucible for some of the world's earliest civilizations and was at times incorporated into Egyptian, Babylonian, Assyrian, Hittite, Persian, Greek and Roman empires. 
After its descent into a messy, multi-sided civil war in 2011, when the country was fragmented into numerous enclaves, the warring parties began to plunder that inheritance, looting museums and excavating ancient sites. 
Islamic State, which from its days as the al Qaeda branch in Iraq had long experience of selling stolen antiquities for profit, seized Palmyra and its extensive Roman-era ruins, a UNESCO world heritage site, in 2015. 
As with other parts of Syria and Iraq which it turned into a short-lived ""caliphate"", it made a public show of destroying many artefacts and ancient buildings as idolatrous, while secretly benefiting from the illicit trade in historical goods. 
The group blew up Palmyra's monumental arch and beheaded its 82-year-old antiquities chief, hanging his body from an ancient column. After changing hands more than once, it was retaken by the Syrian army last year. 
The life-sized image of Yalhi bin Yalhabouda, standing out in relief from a stone tombstone, was excavated from Palmyra's ancient tombs, said the city's new antiquities chief Hariri, and found in a house in the modern town. 
It is inscribed with his name and year of death and shows him carrying a cup of sacred oil and a bowl of cereal, such as would have been ritually distributed after his demise.
Iconoclast jihadists had smashed part of the sculpture's cheek and hat, but it was restored. As with all other stolen Palmyra relics seized by the government, it will be returned to the city, Hariri said. 
But while thousands of stolen objects have been recovered, tens of thousands more are missing - many of them likely outside Syria and in the hands of specialist dealers ready to wait decades before selling them to private collectors. 

The 500 objects displayed in Damascus this week were from eras ranging from 10,000 BC to the Islamic period and were found in captured areas by the army, said Mahmoud Hammoud, head of Syria's antiquities department.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The people of Iran face a sensitive time because of the pressure from America and economic problems, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a key address broadcast by state television on Thursday. 
Khamenei was speaking to tens of thousands of members of the Basij militia and top Revolutionary Guards leaders gathered in a stadium in Tehran.
Discord between Iran and the United States has worsened since U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from a multilateral nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic in May and reimposed sanctions.
""The situation of the nation, region and world is sensitive, especially for us the people of Iran,"" Khamenei said.
""Sensitive in this respect that on one hand we have the shouting of the arrogant powers and politicians of imperialist America...on another hand the economic problems of the nation and the tightness of the livelihood of a large portion of the weak people in the country.""
The Iranian rial has lost approximately 75 percent of its value since the beginning of 2018. 
The United States has said it plans to impose new sanctions targeting Iran's oil sector on Nov. 4 with the aim of stopping Iran's involvement in conflicts in Syria and Iraq and bring the Islamic Republic to the negotiating table for its ballistic missile program.
Iranian officials have said they are involved in the Syrian conflict at the request of President Bashar al-Assad and have refused any negotiations on their missile program.
At a press briefing in Geneva on Thursday, Robert Wood, the U.S. Ambassador to the Conference on Disarmament, said: ""We want to see Iran no longer operating in Syria ... And we will continue to tighten sanctions on Iran – you will be seeing some new steps in November, and we’ll go from there.""
In his speech in Tehran, Khamenei also said that Iran must deliver a slap to America by defeating sanctions.
""With the kindness of God we will defeat sanctions and the defeat of sanctions is the defeat of America,"" Khamenei said. ""And America must receive another slap from the people of Iran with the defeat of sanctions.""

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine has given a Hungarian consul 72 hours to leave country after accusing his consulate of illegally issuing passports to ethnic Hungarians in Ukraine, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said on Thursday. 
Ukraine accused the consul, who is based in the western town of Berehove near the Hungarian border, of ""activities incompatible with the status of a consular officer"". 
The expulsion is the latest in a series of diplomatic rows between Ukraine and Hungary, which have led to Hungary promising to block Kiev's aspirations to join the European Union and NATO. 
""We hope that the Hungarian side will refrain from any unfriendly steps towards Ukraine in the future, and that its officials will not violate Ukrainian legislation,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement. 
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin had warned in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Wednesday that ""the events around the distribution of Hungarian citizenship in Berehove, let's say, do not add joy. They only complicate the already not perfect relationship between the two countries.""
Ukraine's move to oblige teachers to use only Ukrainian in secondary schools prompted Hungary's Foreign Minister last year to say bilateral relations were at their lowest point since the fall of the Soviet Union. 
Ukraine has sought greater integration with Europe since the ouster of a Moscow-backed president by mass protests in 2014 and the subsequent outbreak of a pro-Russian separatist insurgency in eastern regions.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Head bowed, German Chancellor Angela Merkel paid homage in Jerusalem on Thursday to the six million Jews killed by the Nazis and said Germany had a responsibility to confront anti-Semitism and never to forget the Holocaust.
She began a day of meetings between Israeli and German government officials with a visit to Yad Vashem, Israel's national Holocaust memorial, where she laid a wreath on a stone slab that contains ashes of death camp victims.
""Almost 80 years ago, on the pogrom night of November 9, Jews in Germany faced unimaginable hate and violence. This was followed by the unprecedented crimes against civilization in the form of the Shoah,"" Merkel, speaking German and using the Hebrew word for Holocaust, said at Yad Vashem.
""Germany has a perpetual responsibility to remember those crimes and to confront anti-Semitism, xenophobia, hate and violence,"" she said. 
Merkel arrived in Israel on Wednesday for a 24-hour visit as part of annual government-to-government talks between German and Israeli ministers. 
The chancellor's conservative party is under pressure from a surge in nationalism and far right violence in Germany which has been fueled by anger at her decision to welcome more than a million mostly Muslim asylum seekers in 2015.
Merkel had dinner with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Jerusalem residence on Wednesday and the two leaders planned further discussions on Thursday that are expected to focus on Iran and the long-stalled peace process with the Palestinians, before holding a news conference.
Germany remains party to a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and world powers from which U.S. Donald Trump pulled out in May. At the U.N. General Assembly last week, Netanyahu accused Europe of appeasing Iran and said he would prevent Tehran from entrenching in Syria and arming Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas.

On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Merkel has said she sees no reasonable alternative to a two-state solution and voiced concern about Israeli settlement expansion in occupied land Palestinians seek for a country of their own.

Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants detonated the improvised explosive during the passage of a military convoy in the Gercus region of the province, the local governor's office said. An operation was launched to capture the perpetrators, it said. 
The PKK, considered a terrorist organization by the United States, Turkey and the European Union, has waged an insurgency against the state since the 1980s. Violence in the largely Kurdish southeast has escalated since the collapse of a ceasefire in 2015.
Separately, the Turkish military said 13 PKK militants were killed in air strikes in northern Iraq's Avasin-Basyan and Zap regions and in Turkey's southeastern province of Siirt in air strikes over the past two days.
Turkey has in recent months carried out strikes on PKK bases in northern Iraq, especially its stronghold in the Qandil mountains, where Ankara has also threatened to carry out a ground offensive.

Myanmar, which lies in the notorious ""Golden Triangle"" region bordering Thailand and Laos, is at the heart of the global trade in illicit wildlife, with goods smuggled mostly to China.

A report by conservation group Save the Elephants this week said China's recent ban on the ivory trade had done little to stop the ""prolific growth"" in trade in the Myanmar-China border town of Mong La, where there has been a 60 percent growth in new ivory items seen for sale in the past three years.

60,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2018 03:11AM ET</span>",Wife of Malaysia's ex-PM Najib charged with money laundering,"By Rozanna Latiff and Joseph Sipalan
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The wife of former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak was charged with 17 money laundering offences on Thursday, as anti-graft agents investigate billions of dollars missing from state coffers.
Rosmah Mansor, criticized for her extravagant lifestyle as first lady of Malaysia, and Najib, are at the center of a wide-ranging graft probe launched after Prime Minster Mahathir Mohamad's stunning election victory in May.
Najib faces 32 charges from money laundering to abuse of power and criminal breach of trust over billions of dollars that went missing from state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). He has denied any wrongdoing.
It was not clear if the charges against Rosmah relate to 1MDB, but Rosmah's arrest came after three rounds of questioning by anti-graft agents over 1MDB, from which U.S. authorities say over $4.5 billion was misappropriated. Last Wednesday, Rosmah was questioned for nearly 13 hours.
After spending a night in detention following her arrest by anti-graft investigators on Wednesday, Rosmah entered a Kuala Lumpur court on Thursday flanked by dozens of armed police officers, and smiling, waving and blowing kisses at the media.
Rosmah was charged with 17 counts under the anti-money laundering law. She was accused of handling funds of about 7.1 million ringgit ($1.71 million) from unlawful activities, and failing to declare the amount for tax purposes.
""The offences in which the accused has been charged are very serious,"" prosecutor Gopal Sri Ram told the court.
""In this case, the character and standing of the accused unfortunately goes against her because a person of her standing should not be in the dock in the first place,"" he said. 
Rosmah pleaded not guilty to all charges. The judge granted her a bail of 2 million ringgit ($482,509.05).
""It's a good opportunity for Datin Seri Rosmah to clear her name,"" her lawyer Geethan Ram Vincent told reporters outside the court.
The money laundering charges carry a penalty of up to 15 years in jail and a fine of not less than five times the value of the proceeds of any illegal transfers, or five million ringgit ($1.21 million), whichever is higher.
Rosmah, 66, is known for flaunting a range of Hermes Birkin handbags and showy jewelry, and spending thousands of dollars in shopping sprees around the world. 
Her flashy lifestyle has attracted criticism, with many Malaysians asking how she has been able to afford the luxury items on her husband's government salary. 
Malaysians have been outraged by the seizure of around $275 million worth of cash and goods, including a vast collection of Hermes Birkin and other designer handbags, jewelry and watches from properties linked to Najib and Rosmah.
NAJIB AND WIFE IN COURT
Najib also appeared at another courtroom in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday for a pre-trial hearing, as he faces multiple charges in relation to about $10.6 million allegedly transferred into his account from SRC International, a former unit of 1MDB. Najib has plead not guilty.
He later joined Rosmah and they were seen leaving the courthouse together. ""Thank you, thank you,"" Rosmah said while waving to some gathered supporters as she walked out of the courtroom behind Najib.
Allegations of corruption have dogged Najib for years, and came to a head in 2015 when the Wall Street Journal reported that nearly $700 million of funds from state fund 1MDB were diverted to his personal bank account.
1MDB is now the subject of money laundering probes in over six countries, including the U.S., Switzerland and Singapore. 
Prime Minister Mahathir, 93, retired in 2003 after 22 years in power, but came out of retirement to join the opposition to topple Najib in this year's election.
Following his stunning victory, Mahathir reopened investigations into 1MDB and Najib’s possible involvement in its operations.
When asked about charges laid against Rosmah, Mahathir said the government was only following the law.
""It is not about revenge,"" Mahathir told reporters, according to The Star newspaper.

CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - At least five law enforcement officers were shot, one of them fatally, near the city of Florence, South Carolina, on Wednesday, before a suspect was arrested, according to local media and emergency management authorities.
No official details on the shooting were immediately available. But the Florence County Emergency Management Department said on Twitter that an ""active shooting situation"" reported in the area was ""over and the suspect is in custody.""
The tweet advised members of the public to keep away from the crime scene in the residential subdivision known as Vintage Place, on the western edge of Florence.
A person answering the telephone at the county emergency department said he was not at liberty to provide further details. 
In a recording of emergency radio transmissions from the incident posted online by The State newspaper, a dispatcher is heard saying: ""Have an officer down,"" before warning rescue units that access to the victim was limited.
""They advise the patient is going to be behind a residence, and the suspect was still firing. Units be advised, shots are still be fired at this time,"" the dispatcher said.
Florence-based WPDE-TV, citing the Florence County Sheriff's Office, reported that three sheriff's deputies and two Florence city police officers were shot in the incident, and that one of the city officers had died.
WMBF-TV, an NBC News affiliate, also reported that one of the five officers had been killed. The condition of the four other officers was unknown, local media outlets said.
A third local television station, WBTW-TV, reported that eight people in all were shot, seven of them law enforcement officers, including one who died.
WBTW, citing Chief Deputy Glenn Kirby, reported that the suspect surrendered to deputies after talking with a negotiator and was taken to a hospital for treatment. The TV station also cited Kirby as saying a 20-year-old man who was shot inside a house was still alive.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, sharpening U.S. criticism of Chinese policies around the globe, will give China a blunt warning on Thursday that the United States will not back down from what Washington sees as Chinese intimidation in the South China Sea. 
Pence will deliver an 11 a.m. (1500 GMT) address at the Hudson Institute think tank in Washington likely to increase tensions between the United States and China beyond trade disputes that have dominated President Donald Trump's time in office.
In excerpts of his speech seen by Reuters, Pence will call attention to an incident in which a destroyer, the USS Decatur, traveled within 12 nautical miles of Gaven and Johnson Reefs in the Spratly Islands on Sunday.
Pence will say a Chinese naval vessel came within 45 yards (meters) of the USS Decatur ""as it conducted freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea, forcing our ship to quickly maneuver to avoid collision.""
""Despite such reckless harassment, the United States Navy will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows and our national interests demand. We will not be intimidated. We will not stand down,"" Pence will say.
The operation was the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing’s efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters, where Chinese, Japanese and some Southeast Asian navies operate.
China's Defence Ministry said a Chinese naval ship had been sent to warn the U.S. vessel to leave and that Beijing had irrefutable sovereignty over the South China Sea islands and the waters around them. 
Pence will also accuse the Chinese Communist Party of convincing three Latin American nations to sever ties with Taiwan and recognize China.
""These actions threaten the stability of the Taiwan Strait – and the United States of America condemns them. And while our administration will continue to respect our One China Policy, as reflected in the three joint communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act, let me also say that Taiwan’s embrace of democracy shows a better path for all the Chinese people,"" Pence will say.
The United States and China are embroiled in a trade war, sparked by Trump’s accusations that China has long sought to steal U.S. intellectual property, limit access to its own market and unfairly subsidize state-owned companies. The two countries have imposed increasingly severe rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.
Despite the tensions, Trump has said Chinese President Xi Jinping is a friend. But at a news conference but last week in New York, he said: “Maybe he’s not any more, I’ll be honest with you.""
In New York, Trump accused China of attempting to meddle in the U.S. congressional elections coming up next month, while offering little in the way of evidence. Beijing rejected the charge.
He cited a Chinese government-run media company’s four-page supplement in the Sunday Des Moines Register of Iowa as an attempt to turn voters in that key state against Trump's trade policies.
'DEBT DIPLOMACY'
Pence will say China uses “debt diplomacy” to expand its influence worldwide.
""Today, that country is offering hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure loans to governments from Asia to Africa to Europe to even Latin America. Yet the terms of those loans are opaque at best, and the benefits flow overwhelmingly to Beijing,"" he will say.
He will also say that Beijing has extended a lifeline to ""the corrupt and incompetent Maduro regime in Venezuela,"" pledging $5 billion in loans that can be repaid with oil.
Pence will say the U.S. intelligence community has determined that China is targeting U.S. state and local governments and officials to exploit any divisions between federal and local levels on policy.
""It’s using wedge issues, like trade tariffs, to advance Beijing’s political influence,"" he will say.
The goal, he is to say, is to shift Americans' perception of Chinese policies by mobilizing ""covert actors, front groups, and propaganda outlets.""
""As a senior career member of our intelligence community recently told me, what the Russians are doing pales in comparison to what China is doing across this country,"" Pence will say.
Pence will also argue that Chinese officials have tried to influence business leaders to condemn U.S. trade actions, ""leveraging their desire to maintain their operations in China.""
""In one recent example, they threatened to deny a business license for a major U.S. corporation if it refused to speak out against our administration’s policies,"" Pence will say.

The corporation is not named in the speech excerpts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Navy veteran was taken into custody on Wednesday as a suspect in the investigation of letters sent to senior U.S. government officials initially feared to contain the poison ricin, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Salt Lake City said.
William Clyde Allen III, 39, was arrested in Logan, Utah by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on a probable cause warrant and will be charged on Friday, said Melodie Rydalch, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office. 
Allen is under investigation for letters sent to Pentagon officials and President Donald Trump, a separate law enforcement source said.
A Federal Bureau of Investigation statement in Salt Lake City said the agency was investigating ""potentially hazardous chemicals"" in Logan, which is about 66 miles (106 km) north of Salt Lake City.
U.S. investigators have essentially ruled out terrorism after the envelopes sent to a Pentagon mail-sorting facility were flagged on suspicion of ricin, U.S. officials said on Wednesday.
A Pentagon spokeswoman said tests showed that Tuesday's alert was triggered by castor seeds, which ricin is derived from, as opposed to the deadly substance itself.
U.S. security and law enforcement officials separately said an active counter-terrorism investigation was not being conducted into the envelopes.
Ricin is found naturally in castor seeds, but it takes a deliberate act to convert it into a biological weapon. Ricin can cause death within 36 to 72 hours of exposure to an amount as small as a pinhead. No known antidote exists. 
One of the letters was addressed to U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and the Pentagon said on Tuesday it had put its mail facility under quarantine. 
The U.S. Secret Service said it was investigating a ""suspicious envelope"" addressed to Trump that was received on Monday, though it never entered the White House.

Allen served in the U.S. Navy from October 1998 until October 2002, leaving the service as a seaman apprentice, the second-lowest rank, according to the U.S. Navy Office of Information.

China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement late on Wednesday suggestions made by a U.S. official that China had delayed the talks ""completely distorted the facts, had a hidden motive and were extremely irresponsible"".
A senior U.S. official told Reuters on Sunday that China had canceled a security meeting with U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis that had been planned for October.

Beijing and Washington are locked in a spiraling trade war, with frictions between them threatening to move beyond trade.
The meeting of the U.S. China Diplomatic and Security Dialogue, which first took place in Washington last year, was due to be held with Mattis and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
China said on Tuesday it had postponed the talks with the United States at the request of Washington.

Federal prosecutor Felipe Munoz told reporters he was forced to take a nine-year sentence for a guilty plea to money laundering charges from former Veracruz Governor Javier Duarte because he feared a court could throw out key financial information.
Duarte could serve much less time for good behavior. The plea deal sparked widespread outrage in Mexico over what is considered to be one of the biggest corruption cases uncovered in recent history.
Duarte had fled Mexico shortly before the end of his term in 2016 amid charges of embezzling sums that some estimates put in the hundreds of millions of dollars. He was detained in 2017 in Guatemala and extradited.
Despite efforts to bolster anti-money laundering laws, Mexico has struggled to mount successful prosecutions in a country awash with billions of dollars in illicit proceeds from drug trafficking, organized crime and theft of public money.
Reuters reported in August that a host of high-profile corruption cases, including Duarte's, were at risk due to a November 2017 Supreme Court ruling that requires authorities to seek a judge's consent before obtaining banking information.
Munoz said financial data in Duarte's case had been obtained before the precedent.
""What happens if we go to trial and in the intermediate hearing they tell us: Illegal evidence? Do you know what? Duarte would be vacationing in Veracruz, Cancun or Miami right now,"" Munoz said.
""They have applied this precedent retroactively,"" he said. ""It seems to me that this is generating impunity.""
The high court argued in its decision that judicial oversight was necessary to prevent abuses by prosecutors.
In August, a judge threw out corruption charges against a former teachers union boss, citing the Supreme Court ruling. The cases of five more detained ex-state governors facing trial on corruption charges may also be vulnerable, experts have said. 
Duarte belonged to President Enrique Pena Nieto's PRI party, which was defeated in a landslide by President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in July.

Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Dec. 1, promises to end widespread corruption, but he will inherit a dysfunctional justice system that is trying to make a transition to oral, U.S.-style trials.

The ruling by Supreme Court Judge Hugo Nunez marked the latest reversal in fortunes for Fujimori, an agricultural engineer who rose to the presidency on a populist platform in 1990 and a decade later resigned by fax from his parents' homeland of Japan amid graft and human rights abuse allegations.
Fujimori's attorney Miguel Perez immediately filed an appeal and requested a suspension of the arrest order, arguing that Fujimori suffers from heart problems that put him at risk of dying if sent back to jail. Perez said by telephone that it could take weeks for a ruling on the appeal.
Fujimori, who has been hospitalized several times in recent years, was rushed to the clinic from his house several hours after the ruling, according to Reuters witnesses.
""Today I'm with you again in an ambulance,"" Fujimori's lawmaker son Kenji said on Twitter. ""I feel much sorrow.""
Following his extradition to Peru in 2007, Fujimori was sentenced to 25 years in prison for commanding death squads that massacred civilians in a counterinsurgency campaign during his rightwing government. He was later found guilty of corruption.
Former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski granted Fujimori a humanitarian pardon on Christmas Eve, three days after Kuczynski narrowly survived an impeachment vote with the help of Fujimori's supporters in Congress.
Kuczynski, who is known as PPK, had cited Fujimori's poor health for the pardon, saying he did not want a former president to die in prison. But the pardon was widely seen as part of a political deal, and human rights lawyers challenged it on grounds it violated Peruvian and international law on humanitarian pardons.
""This pardon was an illegal scheme between Fujimori and PPK,"" leftist lawmaker Indira Huilca wrote on Twitter. Huilca's union leader father was killed in 1992 in what the Inter-American Court of Human Rights deemed an extrajudicial killing. ""Fujimori must complete his sentence through 2032."" 
A deeply divisive figure in Peru, Fujimori is seen as a corrupt dictator by some and as a misunderstood hero by others. His supporters credit him with quashing leftist rebels and saving Peru from economic ruin in the 1990s.
More than a quarter century since leaving office, Fujimori's legacy and family continue to set the political agenda in Peru. Fujimori's daughter Keiko is the leader of the country's most powerful opposition party, and Kenji has sought to challenge her leadership of their father's political following.
Keiko alleged the ruling was part of political persecution against the Fujimoris. ""It's extremely painful to know that a judge has taken my father's freedom away,"" Keiko, crying, said outside her father's house.

Kuczynski, who turned 80 on Wednesday, resigned due to a graft scandal in March and is now under investigation by public prosecutors in connection with Fujimori's pardon.

RIO DE JANEIRO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Luzia Amaral took a long hard look at Brazil's presidential candidates, and eventually settled on far-right Jair Bolsonaro, viewing him as the only option to prevent the return of the leftist Workers Party (PT) in this weekend's vote.
Amaral is part of a growing number of women who opinion polls show have recently warmed to Bolsonaro, a divisive candidate whose comments belittling rape and defending the gender pay gap have long alienated many female voters.
If the trend continues, some of the women who previously balked at the former army captain could help propel him to the presidency, and possibly a first-round victory on Sunday, pollsters and analysts say.
That prospect cheers investors who fear a return of the PT's state-run policies, but terrifies Bolsonaro's critics, who say his views echo those of U.S. President Donald Trump or even hardline Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.
Amaral said she was not thrilled by Bolsonaro's pledge to loosen gun laws and disliked his homophobic statements, but ultimately she was willing to overlook those if he was able to beat PT candidate Fernando Haddad. 
""In truth, my vote is a protest vote,"" said Amaral, a 64-year-old retired civil servant in downtown Rio de Janeiro. ""Right now, among the current crop of candidates, none of them would be my choice to govern the country.""
After ruling Brazil for 13 of the last 15 years, the PT is blamed by many for a crippling recession, rising violence and voracious corruption. 
An Ibope poll released on Wednesday night showed Bolsonaro with a strong first-round lead over second-placed Haddad.
That survey and others indicate that a run-off vote between the two, which would take place on Oct. 28 if nobody clinches a majority on Sunday, would be close.
The signs that Bolsonaro is gaining momentum led Brazil's stock index (BVSP) up to a near five-month high and its currency (BRBY) to its strongest level in almost two months on Wednesday.
""(The polls are) bringing euphoria to the market ... which is already beginning to price in the possibility of a (Bolsonaro) victory in the first round,"" said currency strategist Fernanda Consorte from bank Ourinvest.
RISING FEMALE SUPPORT 
Bolsonaro's support among women has risen some 6 percentage points in the last week alone, the polls suggest. 
That is all the more surprising given it comes just days after his candidacy provoked the largest female-led street demonstrations Brazil has seen in decades.
Far from slowing Bolsonaro, a federal congressman who was hospitalized for much of September after being stabbed in an assassination attempt, the protests appear to have helped him, particularly among some women who viewed the young, progressive protesters as PT supporters.
Luzinete Silva, a 55-year-old lawyer in Rio who recently decided to vote for Bolsonaro, said the women who participated in the marches were ""misinformed.""
""I don't think those women are well-educated and they're not looking at and reading (Bolsonaro's) proposals and analyzing what's going on in the whole country,"" she said. 
Nobody has won the presidency in Brazil in the first round since 1998.
But sudden last-minute waves of anti-PT sentiment have impacted recent local elections, such as Joao Doria's landslide first-round victory over Haddad to become mayor of Sao Paulo in 2016.
    Bolsonaro's chances of winning on Sunday would be boosted if there is high abstention, and if many voters cast blank or spoiled ballots, said Leonardo Barreto, head of Brasilia-based political consultancy Factual.
    ""If the trends detected by Ibope and Datafolha this week continue with further growth for Bolsonaro, we could have a final wave of support for him,"" said Barreto.

Luca Traini, 29, went on the shooting spree on Feb. 3 in what he said was revenge for the death of a young Italian woman, who was allegedly killed and dismembered by a Nigerian man just days earlier.
Traini targeted black migrants as he drove around Macerata, hitting nationals from Ghana, Mali and Nigeria. He later abandoned his car and made a fascist salute, an Italian flag draped over his shoulders, as police arrested him.
No-one died in the attack and Traini apologized in court for his actions. ""I am sorry for the injuries I caused,"" he said. ""While in prison, I have understood that the color of ones' skin has nothing to do with anything.""
The shootings came a month before national elections that were marked by furious debate over the influx of some 600,000 mainly African migrants into Italy since 2014.
The anti-immigration League emerged as the second-largest party in parliament at the vote and went on to forge a coalition government with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. League leader Matteo Salvini is the new interior minister and has followed through on a campaign pledge to toughen migration laws.
Traini launched his attack three days after the discovery of the body of teenager Pamela Mastropietro near Macerata. A Nigerian, Innocent Oseghale, has been charged with her rape, murder and dismemberment, as well as with drug dealing.
He says Mastropietro died of an overdose and denies killing her.

Merkel and Netanyahu did not make any statements after her arrival in Jerusalem. They were due to hold talks after dinner at the prime minister's official residence but most of the business will take place on Thursday.
Merkel and ministers accompanying her begin with a visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem and will hold other meetings during the day before returning to Germany in the evening.
Germany has remained party to the Iran nuclear deal, which lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbing its atomic program, after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from it in May.
But speaking in Amman, Jordan in June, Merkel said
European countries shared concerns over Iran's ballistic missile program and called for solutions to its ""aggressive tendencies"" in the Middle East.
Netanyahu has repeatedly warned against Iran's nuclear ambitions and has said he would prevent the Islamic Republic entrenching in Syria and arming Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas and supporting Islamist Hamas in the Gaza Strip. 
The Palestinians have tried to get Merkel to persuade Israel not to raze a Bedouin encampment in the occupied West Bank. Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah met with a German diplomat on Wednesday to discuss the matter.
Media reports said Merkel had threatened to cancel the visit if Israel were to raze Khan al-Ahmar, a ramshackle camp housing 180 residents. Earlier this month, Israel's Supreme Court gave the go-ahead for eviction after lengthy litigation.

Children at the encampment held posters of Merkel on Tuesday and appealed to her to help block Israel's plans.

Human Rights Watch said in a statement that Ezzat Ghoneim, head of the independent Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF), was last seen by his wife on Sept. 13 at a police station south of Cairo.
An interior ministry official could not immediately be reached to comment on the report. Egypt denies any rights abuses and says its security forces focus on fighting militants plotting to undermine the country's stability.
Ghoneim's lawyer, Halem Henish, told Reuters his client was detained in March for investigation into allegations that included joining an illegal organization and helping a mother speak to foreign media on her daughter's alleged forced disappearance, a charge that he had denied.
“Forcibly disappearing a lawyer in the face of a judge’s order explicitly authorizing his release reflects Egyptian security forces’ contempt for the rule of law,” said Michael Page, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at HRW.
A judge ordered Ghoneim freed on Sept. 4 on condition that he report to a police station twice a week. 
Authorities moved him on Sept. 8 to a police station near the pyramids, where his wife was able to visit him regularly, his lawyer said, before he disappeared on Sept. 13.
Since coming to power in 2014, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has presided over a crackdown on Islamist opponents and liberal activists, which rights groups say is the worst in modern Egyptian history.
Sisi's supporters maintain that he has been trying to combat an Islamist insurgency and restore order following years of chaos after Arab Spring demonstrations forced former President Hosni Mubarak to step down in 2011.

SULAIMANIYA, Iraq (Reuters) - The election of a respected Kurdish politician as Iraq's new president and his designation of a compromise figure as premier gives the country a fighting chance of achieving stability after years of sectarian bloodshed, war and economic turmoil.
President Barham Salih, 58, who was elected by parliament, is respected by both the United States and Iran, arch-rivals whose competition for influence in Iraq has fueled factionalism in a country already dogged by deep sectarian rifts. 
The U.S. embassy in Baghdad and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani both congratulated Salih on Wednesday, raising hopes he might be able to energize the traditionally ceremonial role of president and engage Tehran and Washington to Iraq's benefit.
""President Barham Salih has a strong personality and he's well respected by the West and regional countries and most importantly Iran,"" said senior lawmaker Rebwar Taha from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the party that nominated him.
Salih's choice of Adel Abdul Mahdi, 76, as prime minister defuses months of tension between Iraq's two main Shi'ite blocs who hold the most seats in parliament and possess the most powerful militias. [nL8N1WI66I]
His premiership marks the end of 15 years of rule by the Dawa Party, which has dominated Iraqi politics since the toppling of Saddam Hussein in a U.S.-led invasion in 2003. 
Lawmakers said that was precisely what made Abdul Mahdi an attractive option, especially to powerful cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who despises Dawa.
Sadr, alongside outgoing Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, leads one of the two main Shi'ite blocs. The other is led by Iran-backed militia leader Hadi al-Amiri and former premier Nuri al-Maliki.
Amiri and Maliki are Iran's two most prominent allies in Iraq. Abadi was seen as the preferred candidate of the United States, while Sadr portrays himself as a nationalist who rejects both U.S. and Iranian influence.
PROTESTS
Iraq now has its three top leaders - a president, prime minister and speaker of parliament - and is edging closer to forming a new government five months after an inconclusive parliamentary election that was marred by historically low turnout and widespread fraud allegations.
The latest appointments come weeks after protests in the oil-rich city of Basra, the jewel of Iraq's southern Shi'ite heartland, threatened to destabilize the country.
The government's inability to handle those protests and provide residents with the basic services they were demanding convinced Sadr to abandon Prime Minister Abadi, his ally. 
""After the unrest in Basra, Sayed Moqtada was convinced that a prime minister who failed to bring clean water to his people will definitely fail at bringing stability to his country,"" said one source close to Sadr.
""That was enough for Sayed Moqtada to sit with Amiri and accept a compromise candidate, Abdul Mahdi.""
Salih's election is the first time someone has risen to one of Iraq's top posts without a backroom deal - an outcome that may suggest lawmakers are making the country's dire needs a priority over political gains.
Since Saddam's fall, power in Iraq has been shared among its three largest ethnic-sectarian components.
The most powerful post, that of prime minister, has always been held by a Shi'ite Arab, the speaker of parliament by a Sunni Arab and the presidency by a Kurd, though that formula has not guaranteed stability.
""TRUE POLITICS""
Both Washington and Tehran had been vying for months to influence the shape of the incoming government, but neither can claim to be the deciding factor in the presidential outcome. 
""The outcome was not predetermined. Despite U.S. and Iranian intervention, everyone was on the phones,"" said Bilal Wahab, a fellow at Washington Institute for Near East Policy who is currently in Baghdad. ""It was a unique political process, true politics. But this was an outlier event."" 
Salih designated Abdul Mahdi prime minister less than two hours after being named president. Abdul Mahdi arrived at parliament even before the presidential election was finished, knowing he was already a shoo-in.
Abdel Mahdi had the right political pedigree: he is an Islamist but doesn't belong to the Dawa Party and is perceived as a technocrat with a decent track record in government.
Getting the approval of Sadr, the cleric who has mass appeal to the poor working class who have grown impatient with the political elite dominated by Dawa, was key.
The other big test Abdel Mahdi passed was gaining the blessing of Iraq's top cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.

Arguably the most powerful man in the country, Sistani has long urged politicians to stop clinging to power and give a new breed of technocrats a chance to rebuild Iraq.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The archbishop of Santiago, the most senior figure in Chile’s Roman Catholic Church, has exercised his right to silence after being summoned on Tuesday morning for questioning by a state prosecutor over allegations he helped cover up child abuse.
Cardinal Ricardo Ezzati faces multiple charges of cover up, including some relating to the case of Oscar Munoz, a former top aide to the Santiago Archbishopric, who is facing trial on charges he abused and raped at least five children.
The Catholic Church in Chile and elsewhere is facing widespread accusations of sexual misconduct by priests and non-clergy employees and cover-ups by church leaders, and investigations of such claims in multiple jurisdictions. 
Citing Ezzati as a suspect in July has proved particularly painful for church authorities and made his public appearances fraught amid protests.
In July, he denied any wrongdoing, adding in a statement: “I reiterate my commitment and the commitment of Santiago’s church to the victims. I have the conviction that I never covered up or obstructed justice and as a citizen will fulfill my duty to contribute all the information that may help clarify the facts.""
Ezzati attended a pre-arranged meeting with prosecutor Emiliano Arias in the city of Rancagua, 50 miles (80km) south of Santiago, on Tuesday morning. The cardinal stayed just over an hour and left smiling but making no comment to reporters outside. 
His lawyer, Hugo Rivera, told journalists they would seek dismissal of the charges in a court hearing, a date for which has not yet been set.
""We are not dodging this,"" he said. ""For now the cardinal will not make any declaration until we discuss the petition to dismiss (the charges) with the prosecutors' office.
""We will discuss everything in public, in court, because we have nothing to hide.""
Arias told reporters after his meeting with Ezzati that the cardinal's decision not to submit to questioning brought ""no adverse legal consequences."" 
""It is a defense option and a legal right,"" he said. ""We will continue to take other statements and to investigate and if necessary we will absolutely summon him again.""

He confirmed that the cardinal had been told of the charges he was facing but they would not yet be revealed in public.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - 
Three International Committee of the Red Cross volunteers helping with the burial of an Ebola victim in eastern Congo were injured in an attack by villagers, prompting the ICRC to suspend burials in the area, health officials said on Wednesday.
The attack on an ambulance transporting the body to a cemetery in North Kivu province's Beni region is the latest disruption to efforts to control the current outbreak, which is believed to have killed 106 people since July. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) last week raised its assessment of the risk of the disease spreading within the region to ""very high"" after a case was confirmed near a lakeside border crossing point with Uganda. 
Community resistance in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has been one of the main problems facing healthcare workers, in addition to armed attacks by militia groups. 
Serge Thierry, a regional ICRC representative, told Reuters that three local Red Cross volunteers were wounded, two seriously, in the attack by angry residents. 
""Security measures were taken immediately. Burials are suspended until further notice,"" he said by telephone, referring to ICRC activity in and around Butembo city in Beni region.
Proper burial of Ebola victims is critical to control the disease, which causes fever, vomiting and diarrhea, and is spread through direct contact with body fluids.
Robert Kahumula, a spokesman for the local Ebola response team, said the health workers ""were wounded during an attack by young people, skeptical of the presence of Ebola in the region.""
""The burial did not take place because the young people ambushed the response team and vandalized the ambulance that was transporting the body,"" he said.
Last Thursday, the WHO warned of a build-up of mistrust toward Ebola response efforts in certain communities in eastern Congo as a result of rumors, misinformation and a preference for traditional medical practices. OLUSWORLD Reuters US Online Report World News 20181003T174509+0000"

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The financial squeeze on India's farmers is set to worsen because of record high fuel prices and surging costs of fertilisers, posing a challenge to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an election that must be held by May.
The rise in input prices could not have come at worse time for farmers, already grappling with falling domestic product prices due to rising yields and abundant harvests.
Yet, the government has few easy options to respond. Rival global producers have complained about Indian state support and falling global farm product prices undermine export prospects.
Indian farmers voted overwhelmingly for Modi in 2014. But a fall in rural incomes risks damaging that support next year.
Thousands of farmers marched on New Delhi on Tuesday to demand better prices for their produce. Police responded with teargas and water cannon. Farmers suspended their protests after talks with officials that ran into early Wednesday morning.
But their demands and those of other agriculture workers, who together make up about half India's 1.3 billion people, have not gone away.
""Although we have decided to end our protest, we still believe that the government is not serious about addressing the concerns of the farmers,"" Anil Talan, national secretary of farmers body Bhartiya Kisan Union, said after the march.
Diesel prices have surged 26 percent this year, making tilling fields, harvesting and transporting crops expensive for India's 263 million farmers who mostly use diesel tractors.
Alongside rising diesel costs, prices of key fertilisers such as potash and phosphate have jumped nearly 15 and 17 percent respectively in a year, as companies pass on the rise in global prices and the impact of the weak rupee to farmers.
India, the world's second-biggest producer of staples such as rice and wheat, imports all its potash needs and relies on foreign supplies for nearly 90 percent of the phosphate it uses.
""It's a double whammy for farmers who have to bear the brunt of lower crop prices and higher input costs,"" said Devinder Sharma, an independent food and trade policy analyst, saying this explained ""why farmers' anger has come to the fore.""
Diesel demand is rising as farmers have started harvesting summer crops. After tilling, they will plant wheat and rapeseed, the main winter crops.
Union official Talan said the government needed to prop up commodity prices and keep a lid on farmers' costs to support the agricultural industry, which accounts for about 16 percent of India's $2.6 trillion economy.
COUNTING THE COST
""Because of higher diesel prices I need to spend nearly 20 percent more on harvesting soybean but soybean prices have crashed this year,"" said Uttam Jagdale, a farmer from Pune, about 150 km (94 miles) south of Mumbai.
Nilesh Sable, a cane farmer from Sangli in the western state of Maharashtra, said fertilizer prices were rising each month.
Fertilizer firms say they have little choice but to pass on at least some extra costs due to a sharp fall in the rupee and a 20 percent rise in international potash and phosphate prices.
""Still, we are not passing the entire burden to farmers,"" said an official with a state-run fertilizer company, asking not to be named in line with government policy.
Greater farm efficiency is partly to blame. Mechanized farming, high-yielding seed varieties and increased use of pesticides have pushed up harvests. Output of most crops has soared to record levels each year. 
India's production of pulses, such as lentils and beans, surged to 24.51 million tonnes in the year to June 2018, up from 23.13 million tonnes in the previous 12 months.
Imports of pulses, such as lentils from Canada, Australia and Russia, fell to 1.2 million tonnes in the financial year to March 2019, the lowest since 2000/01 and well below the 6.6 million tonnes imported in 2016/17 after back-to-back failures in the monsoon.
Plentiful supplies extend to other crops. India is set to surpass Brazil as the world's top sugar producer in the 2018/19 season, but rising output has driven down local sugar prices by 15 percent and left mills nursing losses. 
In bid to help the sector, the government unveiled measures last week such as transport subsidies and incentives to export at least 5 million tonnes of sugar. Brazil, Thailand, Australia and other rival producers were quick to complain.
Vegetable prices, especially onions, cabbage and tomatoes, have also fallen 25 percent from last year, largely because of overproduction. Without enough refrigerated trucks, excess production cannot be stored.
Domestic milk prices dived more than 25 percent in the past year, but a global glut has made Indian exports uncompetitive.
Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai, said India needed to find markets abroad to reduce its inventories.

""But exports will not be easy, as global prices are depressed, and there is no export parity for most commodities,"" he said.

A Gaza health ministry spokesman said the incident had occurred close to the border fence in the northern Gaza Strip and that 24 people had been wounded.
An Israeli army spokesman said about 1,000 Gazans had gathered near the border, close to the Erez passenger crossing, and hurled rocks and other objects at troops and burned tyres.
Troops used anti-riot means, including tear gas and rubber bullets, and, when necessary, live fire, he said.
At least 193 Palestinians have been killed since protests began in Gaza on March 30 to demand the easing of an Israeli-Egyptian economic blockade and the right of return to lands that Palestinian families fled or were driven from on Israel's founding in 1948.
During this year's protests, a Gaza sniper has killed one Israeli soldier and incendiary devices flown over by Palestinians using kites and helium balloons have set off fires that destroyed tracts of forest and farmland in Israel.
Israel accuses the Islamist group Hamas, which controls Gaza and which has fought three wars against Israel in the past decade, of deliberately provoking violence during the protests. Hamas denies the charge.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday he was optimistic his planned visit to Pyongyang this weekend would bring progress toward a second summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and in building a path to North Korea's denuclearization.
Pompeo declined comment on recent negative signals from North Korea, including complaints about Washington's apparent reluctance to agree to a declaration to end the 1950-53 Korean War without major concessions.
""I'm very happy to be going back to get another chance to continue to advance the commitment that Chairman Kim and President Trump made back in Singapore in the second week of June,"" he told a news briefing at the State Department.
""I'm optimistic that we'll come away from that with better understandings, deeper progress and a plan forward, not only for the summit between the two leaders, but for us to continue the efforts to build out a pathway for denuclearization.""
Pompeo also brushed aside suggestions of differences between himself and Trump over a timeline for North Korea to ditch a nuclear program that could threaten the United States.
Pompeo said the day after an unprecedented summit between Trump and Kim in Singapore on June 12 that he was hopeful that there would be major North Korean disarmament by the end of Trump's current term in January 2021. 
In a statement last month, he said the United States aimed for North Korean denuclearization by that date, but a week later Trump said he did not have a time frame.
Pompeo said the statements were ""entirely consistent with each other."" 
""We want it fast, but we’re not going to play the time game,"" he said, adding that his reference last month to 2021 was repeating a comment made by the North and South Korean leaders at a summit last month in Pyongyang.
""President Trump’s comments are exactly right. This is a long-term problem; this has been outstanding for decades. We’ve made more progress than has been made in an awfully long time and, importantly, we have done so in conditions which continue to give us the opportunity to achieve the final goal.""
Pompeo stressed that in the meantime international sanctions would have to remain in place on North Korea and added that there was unanimous support for this at last week's U.N. General Assembly, even if Russia and China ""had some ideas about how we might begin to think about a time when it would be appropriate to reduce them.""

86,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: EU considers trade sanctions on Myanmar over Rohingya crisis,"By Robin Emmott and Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is considering trade sanctions on Myanmar over the Rohingya crisis, potentially stripping the country of tariff-free access to the world's largest trading bloc, three EU officials said.
The sanctions, under discussion at the European Commission, would include Myanmar's lucrative textile industry and potentially put at risk thousands of jobs there but would not come into effect immediately, giving the EU leverage to stop what the West says is ethnic cleansing of Muslim Rohingya. 
Even by triggering a six-month review process on whether to impose trade sanctions, which could be reversed if Myanmar met humanitarian and democratic targets, the bloc would mark a significant shift in policy.
The impetus for the move was a U.N. report in August, which accused Myanmar's military of carrying out killings of Rohingya with ""genocidal intent"". That, and the rare U.S. step of putting sanctions on two entire military units, have put an onus on the European Union to act, officials said.
""We are concerned about the impact on the population from our potential measures, but we cannot ignore a U.N. report describing the military campaign as genocide,"" said one EU official of the debate within the European Commission, the EU executive responsible for the bloc's trade policy.
Until now, the EU has imposed travel bans and asset freezes on several members of the Myanmar military, but has shied away from slapping sanctions on Myanmar's commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who the United Nations said should be prosecuted along with five others for genocide and crimes against humanity.
Myanmar has rejected the U.N. findings as ""one-sided"". It says military action which followed militant attacks on security forces in August last year was a legitimate counterinsurgency operation.
Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay did not answer telephone calls seeking comment on the possible EU move on Wednesday. He said last month he would no longer speak to the media over the phone, only at a biweekly conference.
EU officials believe the formal threat of losing tariff-free access would quickly hit foreign investment in the apparel industry, where European manufacturers take advantage of relatively low labor costs in Myanmar.
""Removing this duty-free access is a measure of last resort, but we must act if other measures are not delivering,"" said one EU official involved in the discussions.
""In light of the deteriorating situation on the ground, the Commission is currently assessing possible ways of escalating its political and economic response,"" a Commission source said.
European firms sourcing apparel from Myanmar include retailers Adidas (DE:ADSGN), C&A, H&M,  Inditex  (MC:ITX), Next and Primark.
Rights groups say the targeted EU sanctions so far have not forced the military or civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi to protect civilians, resettle refugees or stop attacks on press freedoms that have included the imprisonment of two Reuters reporters for breaching a law on state secrets.
The European Parliament last month called for the Commission to review Myanmar's trade preferences.
SIXTH-LARGEST TRADE PARTNER 
Within the Commission there are differences, with the EU Trade Chief Cecilia Malmstrom leaning toward starting the process of imposing trade sanctions while the EU's top diplomat Federica Mogherini is more cautious because of EU policy to avoid economic sanctions that can hurt ordinary citizens, the officials said.
Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has yet to take a position, they said. A Commission spokesman declined to comment.
Myanmar's exports to the European Union were worth 1.56 billion euros ($1.81 billion) in 2017, nearly 10 times their value in 2012, after which the bloc gave Myanmar ""Everything But Arms"" trade status.
That status means it can sell any goods tariff-free to the bloc, except weapons. The EU is Myanmar's sixth-largest trading partner and an important source of foreign direct investment.
Myanmar's clothing industry is its top export earner after oil and gas, generating more than $2 billion in exports and 450,000 jobs last year, according to industry association MGMA.
Trade sanctions would end an economic opening granted to support Myanmar's transition to democracy after Suu Kyi emerged from 15 years of house arrest under military rule and led her party to take both the parliament and the presidency.
One more limited option for the EU could be to exempt textiles, an official said, but given the size of the sector, that would significantly reduce the impact of EU sanctions. Clothing and footwear are worth more than three-quarters of Myanmar's exports to the bloc.
Both the United States and the European Union want to spur economic development to underpin democracy and diminish China's influence. Crushing the economy with trade sanctions could allow China to dominate Myanmar, officials said.
Washington imposed sanctions on four military and police commanders and two army units in August. New sanctions are under consideration for half a dozen other individuals and at least two military-run businesses, U.S. officials have said. 
A U.S. State Department report released last week accused Myanmar's military of waging a ""well-planned and coordinated"" campaign of mass killings, gang rapes and other atrocities against the Rohingya, but stopped short of calling it genocide or crimes against humanity. 
Senior State Department officials told Reuters, however, that those findings could be used to justify further targeted U.S. sanctions or other punitive measures.
There appears to be little U.S. appetite, though, for re-imposing broad economic sanctions lifted by former President Barack Obama as the country shifted from decades of direct military rule toward a democratic transition.

Some European companies have already cut business with Myanmar, with Cartier stopping purchasing gemstones from the country on Dec. 8, 2017, citing abuses against the Rohingyas.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An Israeli official played down on Wednesday the Russian upgrading of Syria's air defenses, saying the newly supplied S-300 missile system could be defeated by Israel's stealth fighters and possibly destroyed on the ground. 
Moscow said on Tuesday that it had delivered the S-300, a decision it took after accusing Israel of indirect responsibility for the downing of a Russian spy plane by Syrian forces as they fired on attacking Israeli jets last month.
Damascus and its big-power backer describe the advanced addition to Syria's arsenal as a major deterrent. Israel and Washington have both voiced misgivings about the S-300 handover.
But asked in an interview if the Syrian acquisition of the S-300 would clip the Israeli military's wings, Tzachi Hanegbi, the country's regional cooperation minister and a non-voting member of its security cabinet, said: ""Unequivocally, no.""
""The operational abilities of the air force are such that those (S-300) batteries really do not constrain the air force's abilities to act,"" he told Israel's Army Radio. 
Referring to F-35 Joint Strike Fighters that Israel began receiving from the United States over a year ago, Hanegbi said: ""You know that we have stealth fighters, the best planes in the world. These batteries are not even able to detect them.""
Reuters reported in 2015 that Israel had trained against a Russian-supplied S-300 system in Greece.
Israel says its air raids on Syria are needed to foil deployments and arms transfers by Iran or Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrillas, allies of Damascus.
Hanegbi said that Russia had previously stationed its own S-300 in Syria, so the system's capabilities had long been factored into Israeli planning. Syria's military would require ""a few months"" to get its S-300 operational, he said. 
""We have clarified to the Syrians more than once that we will not step back from our commitment to prevent Iran's entrenchment in Syria,"" Hanegbi said, adding a veiled threat to take action against the S-300 on the ground: ""We were already forced, a few months ago, to destroy Syrian missile batteries, and I hope they won't challenge us in the future.""
Israel said on Sept. 4 it had carried out more than 200 air strikes in Syria in the previous two years - an average rate of twice a week - with Russia largely turning a blind eye. There have been no reports of such missions since the Russian plane's downing on Sept. 17, however. 
Any such hiatus was a ""tactical situation over a week or two"" rather than a strategic reassessment by Israel, Hanegbi said. 
Asked if Iran and its allies had used the period to step up their activities in Syria, he said he had seen ""no basis for that"" in Israeli intelligence assessments.

Maas said the meeting included intense discussions about the situation in Syria, with both sides keen to increase the pressure for a political solution, and wanted to work start as soon as possible on rewriting the Syrian constitution.
Germany also pledged to more strongly support Washington's efforts in Syria, including through humanitarian aid, and in ensuring that chemical weapons were not used there, Maas told reporters after the meeting.
""We discussed how we can more strongly support the United States in their engagement in Syria. We now will concretize and operationalize that,"" he said.
He said Pompeo understood the political debate in Germany about possible participation in any U.S.-led retaliatory military strike in the event of a chemical weapons attack, and that parliament was unlikely to approve such a move.
""There are different ways to participate to help ensure that chemical weapons are not used there and that none are even present,"" Maas said, citing Germany's expertise in disposing of such weapons.
A U.S. diplomat last week told Reuters that Washington will pursue ""a strategy of isolation,"" including sanctions, with its allies if President Bashar al-Assad holds up a political process aimed at ending Syria's seven-year war.
Nine rounds of U.N.-led peace talks, most of them in Geneva, have failed to bring the warring sides together to end the conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven millions from their homes.
Maas said Germany and the United States agreed on the need to curb Iran's activities in the region and its ballistic missile program, but remained at odds about Washington's decision to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement.

""We want to preserve the nuclear agreement with Iran because ... everything else will not lead to improvement, and the situation could possibly get worse and escalate,"" Maas said. ""No one can have an interest in that.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran on Wednesday for threats to American missions in Iraq and said the United States was terminating a treaty of amity with Tehran, which is the target of increasing U.S. sanctions over its missile programs.
""Iran is the origin of the current threat to Americans in Iraq,"" Pompeo told reporters at the State Department days after he announced the closing of the U.S. consulate in the Iraqi city of Basra.
""Our intelligence in this regard is solid. We can see the hand of the ayatollah and his henchmen supporting these attacks on the United States."" 
The United States announced on Friday it will effectively close the consulate in Basra and relocate diplomatic personnel assigned there following increasing threats from Iran and Iran-backed militia, including rocket fire.
On Wednesday, the World Court ordered the United States to ensure that sanctions against Iran, due to be tightened next month, do not affect humanitarian aid or civil aviation safety.
Judges at the International Court of Justice handed a victory to Tehran, which had argued that sanctions imposed since May by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump violate the terms of a 1955 Treaty of Amity between the two countries.
Washington responded by pulling out of the treaty, a little- known agreement that was signed long before Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution that turned the two countries into archenemies.
Pompeo said the United States should have pulled out of the treaty decades ago. 
""Today marked a useful point, with the decision that was made this morning from the ICJ, this marked a useful point for us to demonstrate the absolute absurdity of the treaty of amity between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran.""
He added: ""We're disappointed that the court failed to recognize that it has no jurisdiction to issue any order relating to these sanctions measures with the United States, which is doing its work on Iran to protect its own essential security interests,"" Pompeo said.
Iran's Foreign Ministry said the court's decisions ""proved once again the Islamic Republic is right and the U.S. sanctions against people and citizens of our country are illegal and cruel.""

Pompeo said the United States would work to ensure it is providing humanitarian assistance to the Iranian people and accused Iran of squandering money it could use on its own people.

The men were suspected of planning attacks on security checkpoints ahead of the 45th anniversary of Egypt's October 6 1973 war with Israel, the sources and MENA said, quoting an interior ministry statement.
The news agency did not identify the suspects nor say whether there had been any casualties or injuries among the security forces.
Police seized a number of automatic weapons in the raid on a farm West of al-Arish where the suspected militants were hiding, MENA said.
The raid comes as the Egyptian army, backed by police, push ahead with a military operation to crush Islamist militants behind a wave of attacks on civilians and military personnel in Sinai.
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ordered the armed forces last November to defeat Islamist militants within three months after an attack on a mosque in Sinai killed more than 300 people.
Defeating the militants and restoring security after years of unrest has been a key promise of Sisi, who was re-elected in March in a landslide victory against no real opposition.
Sisi's critics accuse him of cracking down on all dissent, but supporters say tough measures are needed to stabilize Egypt, which was rocked by years of unrest after protests toppled veteran leader Hosni Mubarak in 2011.
The media is not given direct access to cover high-security operations in Sinai.

Since October last year, more than 100 people have been killed, often by decapitation, in 40 separate attacks, in villages in Cabo Delgado - a province on the border with Tanzania where companies are developing one of the biggest gas finds in a decade. 
The trial was held in the open penitentiary in Pemba, the provincial capital of Cabo Delgado, where hundreds of suspected militants including 50 from Tanzania are being detained.
The area is near one of the world's biggest untapped offshore gas fields, and Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) is seeking to raise $14 billion to $15 billion for a liquefied natural gas project in the region.
In June, President Filipe Nyusi vowed to be relentless and firm in neutralizing those responsible for the attacks.
He was quoted by state news agency AIM on Wednesday as saying he had instructed his security force in Cabo Delgado not kill them.
""If you catch these youths, don't kill them. They are Mozambicans. They've been turned into instruments.  They've been given orders by people who don't want the development of this country and this province,"" AIM quoted Nyusi as saying.
Security consultants and domestic media have described the attackers as members of Al-Sunna wa Jama'a, an unknown Islamist group. Residents have also referred to the attackers as ""Al-Shabab"", although there are no known links to the Somali group of the same name.
Mozambique has no history of Islamist militancy and authorities have been reluctant to ascribe the attacks to Islamists. About 30 percent of Mozambique’s 30 million people are Roman Catholics, while 18 percent are Muslim.

""I firmly deny the accusations being issued against me. Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in,"" the world-famous athlete wrote in a tweet. 
His agents Gestifute also sent the same statement by Ronaldo in an email to Reuters.
""Keen as I may be to clear my name, I refuse to feed the media spectacle created by people seeking to promote themselves at my expense. My clear conscience will thereby allow me to await with tranquillity the results of any and all investigations."" 
Lawyers for Kathryn Mayorga, who sued Ronaldo in a district court in Clark County, Nevada on Thursday, are due to give a news conference later on Wednesday about the case.
Mayorga is also seeking to void a $375,000 settlement she alleges she was coerced into signing to keep quiet, according to the complaint seen by Reuters and according to Mayorga's lawyer.
The lawsuit, which seeks more than $200,000 in damages, names as defendants Ronaldo and an unnamed team of fixers described as ""personal reputation protection specialists"" hired to make the situation go away.
Lawyers for Ronaldo, one of the world's best-known athletes, on Friday threatened to sue German magazine Der Spiegel that published ""blatantly illegal"" accusations by Mayorga.
Der Spiegel's deputy editor-in-chief, Alfred Weinzierl, told Reuters on Sunday that the magazine had worked professionally, confronted and laid out the evidence and stood by its story, which it said was allowed under Germany's press law.
The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police on Monday said an incident report with the number listed in Mayorga's lawsuit was filed on the night of the alleged attack, and said the case was reopened last month. They declined to say whether the athlete was the subject of an investigation.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptians living in areas marked for urban development projects should have a right to remain in their homes if they wish to do so, a U.N. special rapporteur said during a rare visit to Egypt on Wednesday.
Egypt has launched a series of housing projects in recent years and is developing 42 new cities, including a new capital east of Cairo. 
These are designed partly to replace unplanned or informal settlements in which at least 40 percent of Egypt's 97 million population is estimated to live. 
Leilani Farha, U.N. Special Rapporteur on the right to adequate housing, said she was concerned that residents of several areas of Cairo facing redevelopment should ""be able to remain in their communities and homes should they wish to do so"". 
One such area is the Maspero district of central Cairo, which runs along 26 July street and where many homes were razed this summer. 
""I have yet to understand (for) what reason these people are being moved from their homes. It looked like an intact community to me,"" Farha said. 
In Cairo, some communities are being displaced to make way for business or tourism projects that authorities say will boost the economy and attract investment. 
Farha is the first independent rapporteur appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council to visit Egypt since 2010, the year before an uprising toppled former president Hosni Mubarak.
Farha said being invited into the country was an ""important step"", but she had been unable to gain access to some residents and housing rights defenders, and had encountered ""a lot of fear"".
""A number of individuals and organizations would not meet with me in public spaces, expressing fear that talking to me ... might result in them experiencing reprisal."" 
The government appeared committed to tackling housing issues, she said, praising a ""financially innovative"" public housing program that was reaching a vast number of people, even if not necessarily the poorest Egyptians.

But she said her overarching concern was ""the lack of meaningful engagement with residents to determine their own future"". 
People are moving to areas with few economic opportunities, she said, and one new development she visited, al-Asmarat, already looked like a ""potential slum"". 
""No housing program, no new city, no social housing program will be successful without the full engagement of people,"" Farha said.

Nearby in central Berlin, a similar number of people joined a counter-rally chanting ""There is no right to Nazi propaganda"". A major anti-racism rally was also held in the southern German city of Munich.
Merkel's decision in 2015 to admit more than a million migrants and asylum seekers, mostly Muslims fleeing conflicts in the Middle East, has deeply split Germans, who on October 3 mark the Day of German Unity - the day in 1990 when the four-decade division into communist east and capitalist west ended. 
The far-right protesters chanted ""We are the people"" - the slogan used by East German protesters 29 years ago to signal their rejection of the communist government in rallies that culminated in the fall of the Berlin Wall and reunification.
""We are the extra-parliamentary resistance,"" one speaker said, while another read out an appeal for help to ""save the country"" in Russian, English, French, Italian and Dutch.
Protests were also expected later on Wednesday in the eastern city of Cottbus.
Anti-immigrant sentiment and support for far-right parties such as Alternative for Germany are particularly strong in eastern Germany, where living standards continue to lag those in the west despite decades of large-scale public investment.
""We now know that what we call German unity is a process,"" said Merkel, herself an ""Ossi"" from the East, at a Berlin commemoration, acknowledging that the optimism of reunification had not prepared many for the hard slog of reconstruction.
""This is a long journey that demands of us all that we listen to each other, approach each other, never to become complacent,"" she added.
Tensions in eastern Germany have been running especially high since the fatal stabbing of a German man by two migrants from the Middle East in August, which triggered weeks of protests and counter-protests and prompted deep soul-searching among Germans.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The World Court ordered the United States on Wednesday to ensure that sanctions against Iran, due to be tightened next month, do not affect humanitarian aid or civil aviation safety.
Judges at the International Court Of Justice handed a victory to Tehran, which had argued that sanctions imposed since May by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump violate the terms of a 1955 Treaty of Amity between the two countries.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected the decision, saying the court has no jurisdiction and that Washington would terminate the treaty.
Pompeo said Iran was misusing the court for political purposes and that the United States was actively ensuring that humanitarian aid reaches the country, without regard to the court ruling.
The ruling is likely to have at most limited practical impact on the implementation of sanctions, which Washington is reimposing and tightening after pulling out of the 2015 nuclear deal that Iran signed with world powers.
The court order issued on Wednesday is temporary pending a resolution of Iran's full lawsuit against Washington by the ICJ, something that could take years.
Iran's Foreign Ministry said in a statement ""the decision proved once again that the Islamic Republic is right and the U.S. sanctions against people and citizens of our country are illegal and cruel.
“The United States must comply with its international commitments and lift obstacles to Iranian trade,” it added.
The ICJ is the United Nations’ highest court for resolving disputes between nations. Its rulings are binding, but it has no power to enforce them, and both the United States and Iran have ignored them in the past.
The court said assurances offered by Washington to ensure sanctions do not affect humanitarian conditions were ""not adequate"".
""The court considers that the United States must. ..remove by means of its choosing any impediment arising from the measures announced on 8 May 2018,"" said Presiding Judge Abdulqawi Yusuf, reading a summary of a ruling by the 15-member panel of justices.
MORE SANCTIONS PLANNED
The sanctions may not hurt ""exportation to the territory of Iran of goods required for humanitarian needs such as medicines, medical devices and foodstuffs and agricultural commodities as well as goods and services required for the safety of civil aviation,"" he said.
While U.S. sanctions ""in principle"" exempt food and medical supplies, the court said ""it has become difficult if not impossible for Iran, Iranian nationals and companies to engage in international financial transactions"" to purchase such goods.
The Trump administration argued last month that Iran's request was an attempt to misuse the court and that the 1955 treaty specifically ruled out using courts to resolve disputes.
The treaty was signed long before Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution which turned the two countries into arch-enemies.
U.S. State Department Legal Adviser Jennifer Newstead had said Iran's real quarrel was its frustration over the U.S. pullout from the nuclear pact, under which Tehran restricted its disputed uranium enrichment program under U.N. monitoring in exchange for a lifting of most international sanctions.
Trump's unilateral move has put it at odds with the other signatories to the deal, including Washington's close European allies Britain, France and Germany as well as Russia and China.

Washington nonetheless plans to pursue a new series of sanctions due to go into effect Nov. 4 aimed at curtailing Iranian oil exports, the lifeblood of its economy.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Thousands of people marched on Ireland's parliament on Wednesday in the latest angry protest over a housing shortage that has sparked sharp increases in rental costs and homelessness. 
Housing has become the number one political issue ahead of a possible election in the coming months and inside the building Prime Minister Leo Varadkar defended his government's record, pointing to nearly 20,000 new homes expected to be built this year.
""There are limiting factors. There's only so much concrete, only so many service sites, only so many construction workers. We're ramping up things as quickly as we can,"" he said.
While Ireland was left with a surplus of houses after a property crash in 2008, it has come nowhere near providing the number needed to keep up with a rapid economic recovery, with rents in Dublin almost 20 percent above their pre-crisis peak.
While rising, supply is still short of the 35,000 new builds analysts say are needed annually just to keep up with demand.
""Everyone's struggling,"" said Emily Arnold, a 21-year-old computer science student who traveled from the western town of Sligo to join the protest. She plans to leave Ireland when she graduates due to the high cost of living.
""Sligo's okay, it's getting a bit more expensive. We have to work around the clock to afford it but there's no point coming to Dublin, Galway's impossible too. We're going to Toronto, it's cheaper to live out there for a year. Everyone's emigrating.""
Dotted among the large groups of student protesters were workers in their 30s with unstable, short-term tenancies unable to save for a mortgage and older homeowners worried about how their children will put a roof over their heads.
""The way things are at the moment, they haven't got a hope,"" said Sean Murphy, a retired bricklayer in his 70s who attended the rally with two of his 13 grandchildren and one of his sons, who fears being left homeless when his rent is next increased.
""You had a hope of getting a council house (years ago) but it's far worse now. We've never had the amount of homeless that we have and I think that speaks for itself. My children and grandchildren's' generation are the working poor.""

The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, one of the organizers, predicted that the protests will get larger and noisier.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday called Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent poisoned in Britain, a scumbag who had betrayed Russia. 
Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found slumped on a public bench in the English city of Salisbury in March. Britain says they were poisoned with a nerve agent administered by Russian intelligence officers.
Russia denies involvement in the affair, which has deepened its international isolation.
""I see that some of your colleagues are pushing the theory that Mr Skripal was almost some kind of human rights activist,"" Putin said at an energy forum in Moscow when asked about the case.
""He was simply a spy. A traitor to the motherland. He's simply a scumbag, that's all,"" Putin added, in remarks that drew applause from parts of the audience. 
The Russian leader, a former intelligence officer himself, said the Skripal scandal had been artificially exaggerated, but said he thought it would fade from the headlines at some point and that the sooner it quietened down the better.
Putin said Moscow was still ready to cooperate with Britain when it came to investigating what happened, an offer London has so far declined to take up.
British officials say the poisoning was carried out by Russia's GRU military intelligence agency almost certainly acting with the approval of Russian officials. Russia has denied that. 
'ONE OF OLDEST PROFESSIONS' 
Putin also dismissed the allegation that Russia was responsible for the accidental poisoning of Dawn Sturgess, a Salisbury-area woman who British police said died after coming into contact with the nerve agent Novichok which her partner had found in a discarded perfume bottle.
""What, did some guys rock up and start poisoning homeless people over there?"" said Putin, repeating a description of Sturgess and her partner used by some Russian state media. ""What rubbish."" 
Skripal had served time in a Russian prison for selling information to Britain, and Moscow had agreed to release him as part of a spay swap, said Putin, suggesting Russia therefore had no motive to kill him.
""We didn't need to poison anyone over there. This traitor Skripal was caught, he was punished and did five years in prison. We let him go, he left the country and he continued to cooperate there and consult some intelligence services. So what?"" 
The two Russian men Britain accuses of jetting to England to try to murder Skripal said in a TV interview last month that they were innocent tourists who had visited the city of Salisbury to see its cathedral.
London says their explanation is so far-fetched as to all but prove Russia's involvement, while investigative website Bellingcat has published a picture of a decorated Russian military intelligence colonel it named as Anatoliy Chepiga who resembles one of the two men Britain caught on CCTV.
Putin said spy scandals were nothing new. 
""Did problems between intelligence services start yesterday?"" quipped Putin.

""As is well known, espionage, like prostitution, is one of the world's oldest professions.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India raised state-mandated prices for winter crops such as wheat and rapeseed on Wednesday, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi tries to defuse discontent among farmers ahead of elections in 2019.
The government announces minimum support prices (MSPs) for most crops yearly to set a benchmark, although state agencies usually buy limited quantities of staples such as rice and wheat at those prices due to a lack of storage and funds. Market prices for many crops typically run well below MSPs.
This year, Modi's cabinet raised the MSP on wheat by 105 rupees ($1.44) to 1,840 rupees per 100 kg. The 6 percent rise compares with a 7 percent hike the previous season.
The increase will widen the difference between local and overseas wheat prices and make exports from the world second biggest producer of the grain unviable, said a Mumbai-based trader with a global trading firm.
The south Asian country also raised the minimum price of rapeseed and chickpeas by 5 percent to 4,200 rupees and 4,620 rupees respectively, Farm Minister Radha Mohan Singh said.
Low crop prices and protests by farmers are bad news for Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party ahead of three big state elections this year and a general election early next year.
Indian police on Tuesday fired teargas and water cannons to halt and scatter a march by thousands of protesting farmers heading for New Delhi to demand better prices for their produce.
The farm ministry's Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) estimates that the average cost of production for wheat this season would be 1,339 rupees, according to a government document reviewed by Reuters.
The CACP said that MSPs alone do little for farmers as market prices for all winter crops last season were below the government recommended rates.
""This trend essentially shows that a high MSP is not the only policy instrument to sustain higher production and income but it should be backed up by an effective procurement mechanism to arrest the prices falling below MSP,"" CACP said.
""This emphasizes the importance of public procurement machinery and adequate preparatory measures for establishment of a proper procurement system along with adequate modern storage and warehousing facilities with active participation of state agencies.""

The call could put further pressure on U.N. Special Envoy Martin Griffiths, who is expected in Abu Dhabi later on Wednesday to meet Emirati officials and Aidaroos al-Zubaidi, who is president of the Southern Transitional Council (STC) and leader of the separatist movement. 
Tensions between southern separatists, backed by the United Arab Emirates, and the Saudi-based government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi demonstrate the complexity of Yemen's war, as both sides are also allied against the Houthi group which controls the capital Sanaa.
The separatists want to revive the former South Yemen republic which merged with the north in 1990.
""We assure our people in all the southern provinces that we support a popular uprising which would end the suffering, and we insist that it be peaceful,"" the STC said in a statement.
It called on ""the people to control the government's institutions that provide revenues"" but did not say whether this should include oilfields. 
Yemen is a small oil producer, with proven reserves of around 3 billion barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Yemen produced about 500,000 bpd before the war, with more than half of it coming from the Hadramout region in the south.
PROTESTS
The STC statement also urged the separatist forces to protect southern Yemenis protesting against the deteriorating economic situation and a weakening currency.
The Southern Resistance forces, which have been built and armed by the UAE, have more than 50,000 fighters, including 20,000 armed men battling the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in the port city of Hodeidah. 
Violent protests rocked Aden and other southern provinces last month after separatist officials issued similar calls.
The southern Yemenis, the government of President Hadi and the Houthis have all been blaming each other for the collapse of the Yemeni riyal and using the central bank to score political points to gain more allies.
The United Nations has renewed efforts to end Yemen’s nearly four-year war with a plan that calls on the Houthis and Hadi's government to agree a peace deal under a transitional governing body.
Announcing Special Envoy Griffiths' trip to Abu Dhabi, his office said he was working on confidence-building measures, without elaborating.
The Southerners have been providing the bulk of a ground force led by the UAE that is trying to capture Hodeidah, Yemen’s main port city, from the Houthis. They have urged the U.N. to include the issue of the south's possible secession from Yemen in the peace talks.
In an interview with Reuters last month, Zubaidi dismissed suggestions that he was putting pressure on the U.N. envoy over the peace talks, but he said they should include the southern separatists because they control the ground.

Yemen has been caught up in a proxy-war between Saudi Arabia and its arch-rival Iran, which has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced millions and pushed the impoverished country to the verge of starvation.

""It's very emotional... I will never forget (the) incredible experience and the stories that I heard,"" she said after seeing the dungeons and walking through the 'door of no return', the castle's final exit toward the ocean.
She arrived in Ghana on the first stop of her first solo international trip as first lady, a tour of Africa, a continent her husband has been reported to have referred to derisively. She will also visit Malawi, Kenya and Egypt.
President Donald Trump has not visited Africa since taking office in 2017. In January U.S. media reported widely that he described African states as ""shithole countries"" during a discussion with lawmakers about immigration. He has denied making the remark.
The 17th century Cape Coast castle, now a monument, has attracted world dignitaries including America's first black President Barack Obama and his family, who also shared their emotions at the site.
During her tour on Wednesday, Melania Trump walked slowly with a guide through various wings, asking questions. She passed a row of cannons and descended into a dungeon where male slaves were held in chains.
""It's really, really touching,"" she said. ""The dungeons that I saw, it's really something that people should see and experience, and what happened so many years ago -- it's really a tragedy.""
Before proceeding to the slave castle, she visited the palace of the head chief of the area and obtained royal approval to visit the fortress after presenting drinks to the chiefs.

The ceremony took place in Obama hall at the Emintsimadze Palace, a hall that was renamed in Obama's honor after his visit to the area in 2009.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Less than five weeks before elections that will determine control of the U.S. Congress for the next two years, about a third of registered voters do not know the name of their party's candidate for office, a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll found.
Name recognition is critical in motivating voters, is the reason candidates spend millions of dollars on TV ads and is a major factor in incumbents' advantage in fending off challengers.
But it may be slightly less critical on Nov. 6 as many voters may view their choices as referendums on a man whose name will not be on the ballot: Republican President Donald Trump.
""With the current party polarization, voters increasingly vote based on party (read: like or dislike Trump) rather than the local candidates,"" Robert Erikson, a professor of political science at Columbia University in New York City, wrote in an email.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday found that 34 percent of Republican registered voters and 32.5 percent of Democratic registered voters said they did not know the names of their party's congressional candidates in their districts. 
The poll of 2,597 registered voters taken Sept. 24-30 had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 3 percentage points.
The level of congressional candidate name recognition is about in line with recent elections, said Marc Hetherington, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina.
""People aren't voting for their side as much as they are voting against the other side,"" Hetherington said. ""It really doesn't matter what the names are these days.""
Generic party interest is not working to Republicans' advantage nationally. Some 54 percent of U.S. adults told Reuters/Ipsos they disapprove of the way Trump is handling the presidency and Democrats have a 9 percentage point lead in a generic question on which party they expect to vote for in Congress.
Democrats need to pick up 23 seats in the House to win a majority that they could use to more effectively oppose Trump's agenda. (For a graphic, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2DVY4Wy)
Beyond party and name recognition, gender may play a role in voters' decisions this year, said Michael Cornfield, an associate professor of political management at George Washington University. The #MeToo movement and protests around Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have played into that trend.

""In these cases, it's not just the name,"" Cornfield said in an email. ""Gender relations may be the top issue.""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis opened a gathering of bishops on Wednesday with the Catholic Church in a swirling state of crisis over sex abuse, urging its leaders not to let the next generation's faith be snuffed out ""by our own shortcomings, mistakes and sins"".
In signs of the extraordinary pressure the Church has come under from the worldwide abuse scandal, Archbishop Charles Chaput of Philadelphia had called for the ""youth synod"" to be canceled so the Vatican could concentrate on preparing another bishops' meeting on preventing sex abuse.
Cardinal Joseph Tobin, the archbishop of Newark, New Jersey stayed home to deal with the scandal's fallout, and a Dutch bishop, Robert Mutsaerts of Den Bosch, boycotted, saying the synod lacked credibility.
More than 250 other bishops from around the world will attend the month-long meeting with about 40 young people invited to take part as observers.
Two of the bishops are from China, a first following the Vatican's landmark agreement earlier this month that improved ties with the Communist government. Applause broke out as the pope noted their presence in his homily of a Mass for tens of thousands of people in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ). [L8N1WH5SU]
Although the synod's official title is ""Young People, Faith and Vocational Discernment,"" the worldwide sexual abuse scandal looms large in the background and many believe it will be part of the informal agenda in the discussions.
""May the Spirit give us the grace to be a memory that is diligent, living and effective, that does not allow itself from one generation to the next to be extinguished or crushed by the prophets of doom and misfortune, by our own shortcomings, mistakes and sins,"" Francis said in his homily.
The Church is enmeshed in sexual abuse crises in countries including Chile, Germany, the United States and Australia, and the Vatican knows it has to win back disenchanted young people.
The synod began a day after a new Pew Research Center survey found that confidence in the way the pope is handling the sexual abuse crisis has plummeted among American Catholics.
While seven-in-ten American Catholics said the overall opinion of the pope was favorable, six-in-ten said Francis was doing an ""only fair"" or ""poor"" job handling the abuse scandal, nearly double the figure at the beginning of 2018.
Francis said he hoped the meeting, which ends on Oct. 28 and will result in a papal document, will be ""anointed by hope"".
The danger was that young people would be left ""exposed to stormy seas, orphans without a faith community that should sustain them, orphans devoid of a sense of direction and meaning in life"", he said.

Finland's constitution guarantees the protection of private correspondence except where needed to solve a crime.
The new language would create another exception to give the police and security forces the authority to snoop on emails and other messages to gather information about ""military or other activity that threatens national security"".
The measure was backed by 178 lawmakers with only 13 voting against the government's proposed fast-track changes to the constitution.
""It is the parliament's clear will that protecting national security is indispensable also by the means of telecommunications intelligence,"" Interior Minister Kai Mykkanen told public broadcaster YLE after the vote.
Drafting of the new intelligence law had begun already in 2013 but the process was accelerated last year by the country's first Islamist militant attack. Two people were killed and eight wounded in a knife attack in August 2017 by a Moroccan asylum seeker. The man was sentenced to life in prison in June.
Last year the Finnish Security Intelligence Service (Supo) raised its terrorism threat level to ""elevated"" from ""low"".
Fast-track changes to Finland's constitution are very rare and require a majority of five-sixths of parliament. The changes were pushed through with the help of some opposition parties, with only the opposition Left Alliance party opposed.

""I'm perplexed by how lightly lawmakers take fast-track changes to the constitution... this will become a precedent that will have an effect on how the constitution will be changed in the future,"" party leader Li Andersson said.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's largest maternity hospital is asking mothers to care for non-critical premature babies with skin-to-skin contact known as ""kangaroo care"" rather than in incubators, as wards struggle with a lack of equipment.
At the Concepcion Palacios Hospital last week, doctors held tutorials to show nurses and mothers how to hold newborns against their bare chests inside a pouch or cloth wrap. 
Researchers have identified kangaroo care - which has gained adherence in countries including the United States, Norway and Finland - as a way of lowering infant mortality and improving developmental outcomes for premature and underweight babies.
In Venezuela, where public hospitals face shortages of basic medicine and the flight of nurses and doctors abroad after five years of economic crisis, kangaroo care can also provide a way to reduce pressure on scarce resources.
A senior doctor at Concepcion Palacios, speaking anonymously, said the hospital lacked almost all material needed to treat patients, such as water, disinfectant, hospital beds, and useable cubicles.
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not respond to a request to comment about the lack of equipment in hospitals.
According to the last statistics released by Venezuela's Health Ministry, infant mortality, or death of children aged under two, climbed 30 percent to 11,466 cases in 2016 from the year before. 
The report cited neonatal sepsis, pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome, and prematurity as the main causes.
Lide Diaz, the 'Kangaroo Mama' program's coordinator at Concepcion Palacios, said the new focus on skin-to-skin care ensured incubators were available for babies considered to be critical condition.
""We take the baby out of the incubator ... and place it here,"" said Diaz, gesturing to her chest.
Concepcion Palacios is the only public hospital in Venezuela with a kangaroo program, as others are not able to provide the year of necessary follow-up care, Diaz said. The program's rooms are well-maintained, with pictures of kangaroos on the walls.
The United Nations children's agency (UNICEF) has provided the hospital with technical assistance and medical equipment to evaluate babies' health. 
""The kangaroo method saves the lives of premature babies ... and for that reason we support the program at the Concepcion Palacios Hospital,"" UNICEF said in a September press release.
HIGHER CHANCES OF SURVIVAL 
Diaz, a 60 year-old pediatrician, said about 880 premature babies had been treated with kangaroo care since the program started in 2015, and in September they had started to train doctors and nurses to expand the system within the hospital.
""The experience was gratifying. I understood it was important for him to feel my heat,"" said 33-year-old Milagros Marquez of her son Sebastian, who was born at 33 weeks.
Doctors in Colombia first came up with kangaroo care in the late 1970s in response to limited incubators and a high death rate among premature babies. Researchers discovered that babies held close to their mothers' bodies for several hours each day had a much higher chance of survival.
Kangaroo care also includes exclusive breastfeeding, early discharge, and close follow-up care at home.
The babies experience the same movements as they do when they are in the womb and are comforted by the beating of the mother's heart, said Nathalie Charpak, a French pediatrician and one of the founders of Colombia's Kangaroo Foundation.
""What most impressed me was the quality of sleep. It's deep, the baby doesn't have that sort of sleep in an incubator,"" she said in a phone interview from Bogota.
If the mother is busy or ill, the father or a grandparent can substitute.
Joel Martinez, a 53 year-old special needs teacher, spent a month and a half at Concepcion Palacios caring for his two grandchildren. His daughter, Cristina, needed help after separating from her husband during pregnancy.
The twin boys were born at 35 weeks and the smallest, Miguel, weighed just 1.5 kilograms (3.3 lb), but now, eight months later, weighs a healthier 7.6 kg (16.7 lb).

""At first I was anxious ... but I knew the benefit that it would have in the long run,"" said Martinez.

The sea passage from West Africa to Spain's Canary Islands was once a major route for migrants seeking to reach Europe, but attempts have become scarcer since Spain stepped up patrols in the mid-2000s.
Guinean coast guards saw the canoe in difficulty off-shore on Monday, but were not able to deploy a boat in response, Victor Siga told Reuters. 
He said wreckage has since been found, but no bodies have been recovered.
Although home to some of the continent's fastest growing economies, West Africa is struggling to generate enough jobs for its mushrooming young population. As a result, migrants continue to tackle treacherous routes to get to Europe.
A number of migrant boats trying to reach the Canary Islands have been apprehended off the coast off Gambia this year, Gambian immigration authorities said last week.

Former president Tran Dai Quang died on Sept. 21 after a prolonged illness, leaving the mainly ceremonial position open.
""The central committee agreed unanimously to propose that the National Assembly vote on the nomination of comrade Nguyen Phu Trong, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, as president,"" the government said in an official statement on its website.
Vietnam has no paramount ruler and is officially led by four ""pillars"": its president, prime minister, the chief of its Communist Party and the national assembly chair.
If approved, Trong will become the first Vietnamese leader to hold the two titles since founding president and revolutionary Ho Chi Minh.
The 74-year-old party leader has presided over a crackdown on corruption that has seen state executives and a member of the politburo face trial over allegations of financial mismanagement and embezzlement.
Although the presidential post has been largely ceremonial, the move will strengthen Trong's grip over the country after he emerged on top in a 2016 power struggle against former Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung.
But it could also be subject to local criticism, said Jonathan London, a Vietnam expert at Leiden University.
""Such an approach would be met with broad scepticism from large shares of the party in public and could easily result in a situation in which a particular leader could impose their will in a way not seen since the strong man regime of Le Duan,"" said London, referring to Vietnam's party chief during its conflict with the United States. 
A vote on the nomination will be put to Vietnam's rubber-stamp National Assembly which is in session later this month. 

No other candidates have been proposed for the job.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene told a judicial corruption inquiry on Wednesday that he was fired by former president Jacob Zuma for refusing to approve a $100 billion nuclear power deal with Russia in 2015.
Nene is the highest profile figure to give evidence at a probe into alleged influence-peddling by the Gupta family, friends of Zuma, who are accused of using their relationship with the former leader to unduly win state contracts.
Zuma has repeatedly denied accusations by his opponents that he pushed for a deal with President Vladimir Putin at a BRICS summit for Russia to build a fleet of nuclear power stations.
Opposition politicians and local investigative journalists say the proposed deal - which would have been the biggest state contract in South Africa's history - would have included huge kickbacks for Zuma and the Gupta family.
The Indian-born brothers - Ajay, Atul and Rajesh - have been accused of using their ties with Zuma to siphon off billions of rand in state funds and of inappropriately influencing cabinet appointments. 
They left South Africa earlier this year around the time Zuma resigned under pressure from his own party and the authorities are seeking their return to face prosecution.
Nene, in the first public account of the nuclear negotiations, said Zuma became hostile toward him at a meeting at the summit when he refused to sign a guarantee letter Zuma wanted to present to Putin while in Russia.
“It was a very tense meeting that ended with us just being instructed by the president to go and find a solution, which we didn’t find,"" Nene told the inquiry.
“I told the president in the meeting that I could not sign the letter without having first interrogated the financial and fiscal implications”
A spokesman for Zuma did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Allegations of corruption have been swirling around Zuma and the Gupta brothers for years, but the current inquiry is for the first time allowing senior government officials to give their accounts to the public.
""SMOKING GUN""
""Nene's testimony is extraordinarily important. This is the person who was CEO when it comes to the public purse,"" political analyst Ralph Mathekga said.
""Before this evidence it was difficult to connect the dots to Zuma. But this is a smoking gun which shows Zuma was a protagonist in this affair."" 
Zuma fired Nene in December 2015 and replaced him with largely unknown lawmaker Des van Rooyen, sending markets into a tailspin before Zuma appointed investor-friendly Pravin Gordhan as his third finance minister in the space of four days.
Zuma's successor as president Cyril Ramaphosa re-appointed Nene finance minister in February this year. 
Nene told the inquiry he lost his job for not approving contracts that would benefit the Gupta family, particularly the Russian nuclear deal.
""I do believe I was removed as minister of finance for my refusal to toe the line in relation to certain projects,"" he said.
Nene's supporters have portrayed him as a principled official who sought to defend the country's strained public finances against corrupt attacks from Zuma and his allies.
However, his detractors, including the radical opposition Economic Freedom Fighters, say he was involved in corrupt deals with the Guptas when he was deputy finance minister and head of the state pension fund from 2008-2014.
Nene told the inquiry he met the Gupta brothers several times, including four visits to their family home in Johannesburg between 2010-2013, but said it was normal practice to meet business leaders as a deputy finance minister.

Rato, who was economy minister in Spain and a prominent figure in the ruling People's Party (PP) before moving to the IMF, chaired Bankia for two years until just before its state bailout in 2012.
In 2017, the court considered Rato responsible for overseeing the misuse of credit cards and said he could have reversed the practice that involved dozens of other executives and board members of Bankia.
Rato had appealed the ruling and denied any wrongdoing, arguing the expenses he accrued on the Bankia credit cards were legal.

The case is one of several high-level corruption investigations now coming to fruition and has been seen as a test of whether Spain's rich and powerful are accountable before the law.

The Catholic Church worldwide is reeling from crises involving sexual abuse of minors, deeply damaging confidence in the Church in Chile, the United States, Australia and Ireland among other countries.
On Tuesday Poland's court of appeal upheld a landmark ruling granting a one-off compensation and an annuity to a victim of sexual abuse by a Catholic priest, accepting that the Church in Poland held responsibility for its priest's crimes.
""One has a right to lodge a cassation appeal to the Supreme Court and the Society will use this right,"" Krzysztof Wyrwa, an attorney for the Society of Christ Fathers for Poles Living Abroad Society, said in a statement.
Wyrwa added that the ruling could not be used in other pedophile cases in the future against the Church in Poland. A spokesman for the Society has said no further comment will be given.
In January, a court ordered the Society to pay compensation to a woman who had been sexually abused by a priest as a 13-year old child in northwestern Poland. On Tuesday the court of appeal in the western city of Poznan upheld the ruling.
The man, who imprisoned and raped the girl for more than 10 months, was arrested in 2008 and sentenced in 2010 to four years in prison, Gazeta Wyborcza daily reported.
Activists have said that the case, the first ruling in Poland where the Catholic Church was recognized as responsible for a pedophile crime committed by one of its priests, would give other victims courage to bring their cases to courts.
Church attendance is declining in Poland, but it remains one of Europe's most religious countries. Nearly 85 percent of the 38 million population are Catholic, and 37 percent of those attend Sunday mass, according to research done by priests.
Pope Francis is battling to address the issue worldwide and will meet with senior Catholic bishops at the Vatican in February to discuss the protection of minors. 
Nearly a million people flocked to cinemas across Poland last weekend to watch a movie called ""Clergy"" that depicts Catholic priests in a highly unflattering light, breaking box-office records.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's announcement in April that he wanted to pull U.S. troops out of Syria left the country's Kurds fearing they would be abandoned by their most important military ally.
Six months later, as the battle against Islamic State draws to a close, Syrian Kurdish leaders see signs of renewed U.S. interest in the oil-rich region they control in northern and eastern Syria.
A spate of visits to Syria by U.S. diplomats in the past two months and a new readiness to discuss the country's future point to a longer-term U.S. commitment, they say.
U.S. forces are seen as a shield against attacks by Turkey from the north and protection against any attempt by President Bashar al-Assad to seize the region's wheat and oil fields. 
""We feel (the Americans) are more committed now,"" Aldar Xelil, a top Kurdish politician, said. 
""There's attention, a political file and follow-up beyond the realm of fighting (Islamic State),"" he said. ""At the very least, before there was no talk of this at all."" 
After Trump's announcement, Kurdish-led authorities began talks with Damascus. They did so partly out of concern their ally could walk away, though other U.S. officials played down the odds of withdrawing soon. 
The talks have come to a standstill, one Kurdish official said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, control nearly a quarter of Syria. This territory, where they have carved out autonomous rule, is the largest chunk of Syria outside the state's hands.
Assad sees the Americans as ""foreign occupiers"" and has threatened force to restore the region, where some 2,000 U.S. troops stand alongside the SDF and supply weapons. 
Even as Washington helped Kurdish fighters seize territory from Islamic State, it has opposed their autonomy plans and avoided making any political promises.
Conflicting U.S. messages have put the Kurds on guard at times, and they worry Washington may ultimately put its ties with fellow NATO member Turkey first. 
""We do get along great with the Kurds. Don't forget, that's their territory,"" Trump told a news conference at the United Nations general assembly last week. ""We have to help them. I want to help them...They fought with us. They died with us.""
The U.S.-Kurdish military friendship has infuriated Turkey, which views the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), classified as terrorist by Ankara and the United States. 
U.S. HAS ""ENTERED POLITICAL ARENA""
In line with Ankara's wishes, the main Kurdish parties and their allies have been repeatedly left out of international talks on Syria's conflict since it began in 2011.
Ilham Ahmed, a senior member of the SDF's political wing, the Syrian Democratic Council, said U.S. officials had now ""entered the political arena"".
She welcomed comments about engaging the Kurds in any future peace settlement and about U.S. forces not leaving before there is progress in defunct United Nations talks on Syria. 
""But the results remain the most important to us ... So far we have not seen a clear plan,"" she said. ""Visits alone are not enough. But rather guarantees of protecting the region and including (us) in the political process.""
Xelil said the latest shift may stem from ramped-up U.S. efforts to counter Assad's ally Iran. He pointed to remarks by National Security Adviser John Bolton, who said troops would stay in Syria as long as Tehran did.
He said the SDF's attempts to negotiate with Assad, who has clawed back most of the country, could be another factor.
Amjad Othman, an SDC spokesman and founding member, said talks with the Damascus government have reached an impasse since the first meeting in July. The two sides have mostly avoided fighting during the war.
The state ""insists on sticking to the current order"" and refuses to make changes to the constitution, he said. ""There's no use as long as it's not willing to make any concessions."" 
DAMASCUS ACCUSES U.S. OVER TALKS
Syrian Kurds, whom the state persecuted for years, say they do not seek independence, but hope a political deal will secure their autonomy and minority rights. 
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem accused Washington of ruining the negotiations.
""The Kurdish citizens...are discussing a set of rights, some of them could be achieved through dialogue,"" he told Russia's RT channel on Sunday. ""But the danger is the American presence...is giving the Kurds hope that they can work outside the legitimate government in Damascus, and this is an illusion."" 
The United States said in August it had raised $300 million for parts of Syria taken from Islamic State, after Trump demanded that allies help carry the costs of the war. 
Jim Jeffrey, a top U.S. diplomat for Syria, told Reuters on Friday that $100 million had come through from Saudi Arabia, so Washington beefed up its teams and ""stabilization"" work. He said this included ""local governance"". 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has tasked Jeffrey with overseeing the U.S. political role.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis also underlined the U.S. interest in Syria this week.
""Our diplomats, they are on the ground (and) have been doubled in number,"" Mattis told a news conference during a visit to Paris. After the fighting ends, he said, troops would work to ensure the jihadists do not return.

""As we see the military operations become less, you'll see the diplomatic effort now able to take (root).""

Meghan married Queen Elizabeth's grandson Harry in May this year, and on Wednesday the couple visited the so-called Sussex Declaration one of only two known handwritten parchment copies of America’s formative text, at Edes House in Chichester.
The manuscript had been stored for more than 60 years in a strong-room among miles of documents in the West Sussex Record Office, until its significance was revealed by two Harvard University researchers last year.
The declaration cast Britain as a tyranny.
""The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States,"" it says.
Measuring 24 by 30 inches (60 by 76 cm), the Sussex Declaration is thought to date to the 1780s and most likely was written in New York or Philadelphia, and while other copies and printed versions of the Declaration exist, the only other ceremonial parchment is the Matlack Declaration, which dates from 1776 and is kept at the National Archives in Washington.
The trip will also include a visit to the Royal Pavilion in Brighton as Harry and Meghan pay their first trip to Sussex since they were made Duke and Duchess of the southern English county.

They will also visit a charity for survivors of sexual abuse before discussing mental health and emotional wellbeing with youth groups.

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has warned India against a planned purchase of S-400 surface-to-air missiles from Russia when President Vladimir Putin's visits New Delhi this week, saying such an acquisition would attract sanctions under U.S. law.
India's military wants the missile batteries, both as a deterrent against China and to gain an edge over traditional rival, Pakistan, as they are able to track and shoot down combat aircraft, even stealth planes, at unprecedented ranges.
India and Russia will sign the missile deal, estimated at more than $5 billion, during Putin's visit for annual summit talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi beginning on Thursday, a Kremlin aide said.
But the United States has warned countries trading with Russia's defense and intelligence sectors they would face automatic sanctions under a sweeping legislation called Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) that President Donald Trump signed into law last August.
The law is designed to punish Putin for the 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, involvement in the Syrian civil war and meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
""We urge all of our allies and partners to forgo transactions with Russia that would trigger sanctions under the CAATSA,"" a U.S. State Department representative said.
""The administration has indicated that a focus area for the implementation of CAATSA Section 231 is new or qualitative upgrades in capability – including the S-400 air and missile defense system.""
Last month, the United States imposed sanctions on China's military for its purchase of combat fighters as well as the S-400 missile system it bought from Russia this year.
The United States is also concerned about NATO ally Turkey’s decision to buy the Russian missile system, seeing it as incompatible with the alliance systems. 
Modi's government, caught in the U.S.-Russia crossfire, hopes the Trump administration will give it a pass on the proposed arms transfer from Russia, officials in New Delhi said. 
Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters India was closing in on the deal to buy the air defense system from Russia, with which it has long-standing military ties.
""Negotiation on S-400 air defense systems has been on for a long while and it is at a stage where it can be finalised,"" Sitharaman said last week. ""We have a big legacy of buying defense equipment from Russia.""
More than 80 percent of India's military equipment was of Soviet origin during the days of the Cold War, but since its breakup New Delhi has diversified its weaponry. 
The United States is one of its top arms suppliers, closing $15 billion worth of deals in just the last decade.
U.S. firms  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) lead the race to sell the Indian military hundreds of aircraft to replace its aging Russian MiG planes. 
The Modi government hopes the Trump administration will not disrupt burgeoning defense ties with the world's biggest arm importer by levying sanctions the U.S. Congress has sought.
The Trump administration faced competing pressures from Congress pursuing a hard line on Russia, said Jeff Smith, a specialist on South Asia at the Heritage Foundation.
""The administration was critical of the CAATSA and fought hard for a national security waiver at the cabinet secretary level but was denied by Congress,"" he said.

""The administration is not only trying to navigate competing geopolitical interests but relatively stringent conditions imposed by a Congress determined to tie its hands on Russia policy.""

STRASBOURG, France (Reuters) - Romania appears to be backsliding in its judicial reforms, the European Commission said on Wednesday, underlining its concerns that the country could be a potential domino after Hungary and Poland with their perceived authoritarian drift.
Plans by Romania's Social Democrat-led ruling coalition to overhaul the judiciary and change legislation to potentially decriminalize several corruption-related offences have drawn criticism from the EU, the U.S. State Department and Romanian magistrates, and have triggered large street protests.
This is a worrying development, European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans.
""We have seen substantial progress in the past but things are now moving backwards in a way that would be damaging for the place that Romania has built as an EU member state in recent years,"" Timmermans told EU lawmakers during a debate on Romania.
""I call on the Romanian authorities to conduct full and impartial investigations of this issue,"" he said.
""The reform to the judicial laws and criminal court are interlinked and it must be avoided that they have a negative impact on the independence of the judiciary and their effectiveness to combat corruption.""
Romanian Prime Minister Viorica Dancila dismissed the criticism. ""Do not deny Romania things that are permitted to other member states of the Union and do not allow that in Romania, things should happen that are unacceptable in other member states,"" she told European Parliament.
""We want to be a partner but we want to be equal partners. No one never will be able to turn Romania back from its European road,"" Dancila said.
The center-right European People's Party (EPP), the largest in the European Parliament, joined in the criticism.

""Romanians fought against communism for their liberties. They tore down a tyranny and built a democracy. Such brave and noble efforts should not be undermined,"" said Esteban Gonzalez Pons, EPP vice-chairman.

120,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 06:01AM ET</span>",Hong Kong bishop fears Chinese Catholic 'suppression' to continue despite Vatican pact,"By Greg Torode
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's leading Catholic cleric said on Wednesday that he feared continued suppression of Catholics in mainland China despite a landmark accord struck last month between the Vatican and Beijing's Communist Party leadership.
Michael Yeung, the Bishop of Hong Kong, said it would take time to address issues beyond the appointment of bishops agreed in the accord. These included the release of detained clerics and full free expression of religious belief in China.
The details of the provisional agreement, which gives the Vatican its long-desired approval of the appointment of bishops in China, have not been made public by either side.
Yeung, whose Hong Kong diocese has for decades served as a free Catholic beachhead on the edge of an officially atheist China, said he had not seen the details.
""I don't think the signing of this provisional agreement means the solution of everything. It takes time, it will take a few years to see,"" he told Reuters in a rare interview.
""A provisional agreement could not stop the suppression, could not stop the churches being torn down and the young folks under 18 still not allowed to go to church. These things will take time to solve,"" he said.
China's Foreign Ministry did not respond immediately to a faxed request for comment. The country is mostly closed for the Golden Week holiday.
Yeung urged China to provide information about priests and bishops detained on the mainland, some of whom are elderly and held for decades.
A Reuters report on Sunday cited three sources familiar with the matter who said the plight of the detained clergy remains unresolved and Beijing has provided little clear information about their fate.
Yeung said many Hong Kong Catholics had been praying for one of the longest held, Bishop James Su Zhimin, who was arrested in 1997 in Hebei province and would now be 86 years old.
""Whether he is in prison, or kept secret in some other place, or whether he has already died, nobody really knows,"" he said.
Su was part of the underground church, which has been loyal to the Pope for decades - a movement that some critics of the accord fear will be crushed by the state-backed official church that has at times previously chosen its own bishops.
The deal allows for the Pope to approve bishops first selected by church communities and the Chinese authorities, meaning China's 12 million Catholics split between the two camps must now effectively integrate. 
Despite his concerns, Yeung said he supported the deal, saying that after years of trouble and talks it was vital to agree on something and move forward.
The soft-spoken Shanghai-born cleric, who took office in August last year, said he and his Hong Kong flock ultimately had to put their trust in God and the Pope.
Yeung said he had advised Pope Francis to strike a deal during an audience at the Vatican in August, but had also stressed the need for caution.
""I said...Holy Father, move forward, don't be afraid but be cautious,"" Yeung said.
""It is like crossing a river which you have never crossed before. You have to test the depth of the water, you have to touch the stones.""

121,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 05:46AM ET</span>","With an eye on Russia, U.S. pledges to use cyber capabilities on behalf of NATO","By Idrees Ali
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The United States is expected to announce in the coming days that it will use offensive and defensive cyber capabilities on behalf of NATO if asked, a senior Pentagon official said, amid concerns about Russia's increasingly assertive use of its cyber capabilities.
The 29-nation NATO alliance recognized cyber as a domain of warfare, along with land, air and sea, in 2014, but has not outlined in detail what that entails.
""We will formally announce that the United States is prepared to offer NATO its cyber capabilities if asked,"" Katie Wheelbarger, the principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, told reporters during a trip to Europe by U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.
Wheelbarger said the United States will keep control of its people and capabilities but use them in support of NATO if asked. She added that it was a part of a British-led push to increase NATO's cyber capabilities. 
In a recent summit, member nations said NATO would create a cyberspace operations center to coordinate NATO's cyber activities. NATO has also talked about integrating individual nations' cyber capabilities into alliance operations. 
Last year, officials said the United States, Britain, Germany, Norway, Spain, Denmark and the Netherlands were drawing up cyber warfare principles to guide their militaries on what justifies deploying cyber attack weapons more broadly.
In Europe, the issue of deploying malware is sensitive because democratic governments do not want to be seen to be using the same tactics as an authoritarian regime. 
Senior Baltic and British security officials say they have intelligence showing persistent Russian cyber hacks to try to bring down European energy and telecommunications networks, coupled with internet disinformation campaigns.
U.S. intelligence officials have found that in the campaign leading up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Russian hackers breached the Democratic National Committee and leaked confidential information.
""It sends a message primarily aimed at Russia,"" Wheelbarger said. 
She added that the move would make clear that NATO is capable of countering Russian cyber efforts and would help in creating a more coherent cyber policy across the alliance.
""U.S. together with the United Kingdom clearly lead in the level and sophistication of capabilities and if used, they would likely lead to tactical success,"" said Klara Jordan, director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington. 
Heather Conley, with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said there was still a challenge in defining what the rules were when it came to cyber weapons. 
""I think that the greater challenge, and we're certainly struggling with it here in the U.S., is what are the rules of engagement? What does the escalation ladder look like when one begins to use cyber offensive capabilities?"" Conley, a former U.S. State Department official, said. 
Last month the White House warned foreign hackers it would increase offensive measures as part of a new national cyber security strategy.

U.S. intelligence officials expect a flurry of digital attacks ahead of the Nov. 6 congressional elections.

PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo made a second visit to earthquake-devastated Sulawesi island on Wednesday, saying efforts to help survivors were gearing up and he was keen to see economic activity resume.
Five days after disaster struck, time is running out for anyone trapped under collapsed buildings, while aid workers warned of increasing desperation in hard-hit outlying areas that have yet to get any help at all.
The official death toll from the 7.5 magnitude quake that struck the west coast of Sulawesi last Friday stood at 1,234, many killed by tsunami waves triggered by the quake.
But officials fear the toll could soar, as most of the confirmed dead have come from Palu, a small city 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta, and losses in remote areas largely cut off since Friday have yet to be determined.
Underlining a growing sense of urgency, Widodo made his second visit to the disaster zone, putting on an orange hard hat to talk to rescue workers at a collapsed Palu hotel.
""What I've observed after returning now is heavy equipment has arrived, logistics have started to arrive although it's not at maximum yet, fuel has partly arrived,” Widodo told reporters.
Asked about efforts to restore electricity, he said:
""This is all a process. Most importantly, I've asked the governor to reopen economic centers so people start to return to daily activities, while the evacuation process continues, and later rehabilitation and reconstruction.""
Widodo, who will seek re-election next year, called on Tuesday for reinforcements in the search for victims, saying everyone had to be found. He repeated that on Wednesday, after inspecting what he called an ""evacuation"" effort at the Hotel Roa Roa, where he said some 30 people lay buried in the ruins.
""We'll continue this process so all the victims can be retrieved,” he said.
At least seven cargo planes arrived at Palu airport earlier on Wednesday carrying tonnes of aid, some bedecked in the red and white national colors and stamped with the presidential office seal declaring: ""Assistance from the President of Republic of Indonesia”.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, said late on Tuesday rescuers had reached all four of the badly affected districts, which together have a population of 1.4 million, but he declined to give an estimate of casualties.
""We hope the death toll does not rise,"" he said. ""We're continuing rescue operations but right now the team is racing against time.""
'GOVERNMENT MISSING'
The quake brought down hotels, shopping malls and thousands of houses in Palu, while tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet) scoured its beachfront shortly afterwards.
About 1,700 houses in one neighborhood alone were swallowed up by ground liquefaction, which happens when soil shaken by an earthquake behaves like a liquid, and hundreds of people are believed to have perished, the disaster agency said.
Adding to Sulawesi's woes, the Soputan volcano in the north of the island, about 600 km (375 miles) northeast of Palu, erupted early on Wednesday but there were no reports of any casualties or damage. Ash was not expected to disrupt flights.
But concern is growing about conditions in remote areas, many of which have been cut off by destroyed road, landslides and downed bridges.
Aid worker Lian Gogali said the situation in badly hit Donggala district was very difficult. 
""Everyone is desperate for food and water. There's no food, water, or gasoline. The government is missing,"" she said.
She said her aid group had been sending in a trickle of rations into the district of some 300,000 people by motorbike.
The national disaster agency has said tents, food, water and sanitation facilities for more than 60,000 displaced people are in short supply.
Police have done little to stop outbreaks of looting. The government has played down the problem, saying victims could take essentials and shops would be compensated.
The government has said it would accept offers of international aid, after shunning outside help this year when two major earthquakes struck Lombok island, south of Sulawesi.
U.S. President Donald Trump extended condolences in a phone call with Widodo, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters in Washington. The United States has provided initial funding, deployed government disaster experts and was working to determine what other help can be given, she said.

Sitting on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is one of the world's most vulnerable countries to quakes and tsunamis. A quake in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.

The case of Andrew Brunson, whose next regular court hearing is on Oct. 12, has become the most divisive issue in a worsening diplomatic row between Ankara and Washington that has triggered U.S. sanctions and tariffs against Turkey.
The filing to the constitutional court - Turkey's highest - seen by Reuters showed the lawyer had requested the court to rule that Brunson's right to freedom had been violated and to release him from house arrest.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a news conference on Tuesday that the United States would maintain close contact with the Turkish government over Brunson's trial.
""We certainly would like Pastor Brunson home right away. It’s long overdue,"" she said.
Brunson is charged with links to Kurdish militants and supporters of Fethullah Gulen, the cleric blamed by Turkey for a failed coup attempt in 2016. He has denied the accusation - as has Gulen - and Washington has demanded his immediate release.
Jailed or held under house arrest since October 2016, Brunson faces up to 35 years in jail if convicted. Last month the main prosecutor in his trial was replaced, a move which his lawyer cautiously welcomed, saying it might be a sign of changing political will.

President Tayyip Erdogan has said politicians have no sway on the judiciary and that the courts will decide on Brunson's fate. He said on Monday that Brunson has ""dark links with terror organizations.""

PARIS (Reuters) - A convict who escaped from a French prison in a helicopter with the help of an armed commando team was arrested by police on Wednesday after a three-month hunt, adding another chapter to the life of a gangster dubbed the ""jailbreak king"".
Redoine Faid, who escaped in July from a high-security prison where he was serving 25 years for a heist in which a policewoman was killed, was arrested at an apartment in Creil, the area where he grew up, an hour's drive north of Paris.
About 50 officers, some of them elite troops, took part in the pre-dawn raid, in which they also arrested a brother of Faid, two other men and a woman, police sources said. Guns were found at the premises, they added.
Faid, 46, became a notorious semi-celebrity after penning a tell-all book about his colorful life, describing how he was born into crime in high-rise housing estates of the kind that sprouted around Paris in the 1960s and 1970s.
The book came out in 2010, shortly after his release from jail for a previous hold-up conviction. But within months he was arrested again over an attack on a cash-transport truck that lead to the death of a young policewoman.
Faid's notoriety made him almost a household name when he subsequently took four prison wardens hostage and dynamited his way out of a jail in northern France in 2013. He spent six weeks on the run before he was tracked down and put back behind bars.

The latest jailbreak, in which armed men with power saws landed in an open-air prison courtyard to free him from an adjacent visitor room before flying out in their hijacked helicopter, prompted a political debate over security in France, where wardens went on strike last year over safety standards.

Products such as condoms and sunscreen are exempt from the 10 percent goods and services tax that has been added to all other items sold in Australia for almost 20 years, including female sanitary products.
Frydenberg said the tax would be removed from Jan. 1, 2019, after the approval of Australian state and territory lawmakers was secured.
""We're really delighted that everyone's come on board to scrap what is an unfair tax,"" Kelly O'Dwyer, minister for women, told reporters in Melbourne.
""Millions of Australian women will benefit as a result."" 
Canada dumped a similar tax in 2015 after a petition was signed by more than 70,000 people, while Britain will scrap its equivalent tax on tampons from 2022.
""The government has a problem with female voters, particularly centrists who have been turned off by some of its rhetoric,"" said Peter Chen, professor of political science at the University of Sydney.
""In the era of #MeToo, it is a move that was a inevitable,"" he said.
The politically unpopular tax will cease in Australia four months before the next election is due. Opinion polls indicate the government is on course for a heavy defeat, with voters angry about the ousting of former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull in a party-room coup in August.
New Prime Minister Scott Morrison emerged as a compromise candidate after a challenge to Turnbull was launched by the right wing of the Liberal party, the senior partner in the Liberal-National coalition.

A recent opinion poll showed the government was trailing the main opposition Labor party by 54 percent to 46 percent on a two-party preferred basis under Australia's preferential voting system, where votes from minor parties are redistributed.

The eruption comes less than a week after a 7.4-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami killed at least 1,234 people and displaced more than 60,000 people in Central Sulawesi. Mount Soputan is located about 900 kilometers northeast of the quake ravaged region and there were no immediate reports of any casualties from the volcanic eruption.
President Joko Widodo headed back to the quake-affected areas for a second time on Wednesday to supervise rescue and relief operations as reports of mass looting of food and other goods emerged. The toll may rise as rescuers were unable to extricate people suspected to be buried under buildings that collapsed due to liquefaction, a phenomenon that causes soil to lose its strength after violent shaking, according to Nugroho.
Though Central Sulawesi accounts only for about 1 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, the reconstruction cost may weigh on the government’s finances as it battles a slump in the currency. The rupiah weakened past 15,000 per dollar for the first time in 20 years on Tuesday and is down 10 percent this year.
The quake and volcano may also hurt the nation’s all-important tourism industry, which was rattled by a series of deadly earthquakes in popular tourist destination of Lombok island, near Bali. Foreign tourist arrivals have been disrupted by a volcanic eruption at Mount Agung on Bali island late last year and Mount Merapi near Yogyakarta this year.
Indonesia’s 17,000 islands are prone to earthquakes because the country straddles the Pacific Ring of Fire -- an arc of fault lines and volcanoes that causes frequent seismic upheavals. At least 160,000 people were killed on Sumatra island as a result of a 9.1 magnitude earthquake and tsunami on Boxing Day in 2004. The Sulawesi disaster is the worst since more than 6,000 people were killed in an earthquake in Central Java region in 2006."
131,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2018 01:21AM ET</span>",Friends of Saudi dissident worried by absence at Istanbul consulate,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Two people close to Saudi political commentator Jamal Khashoggi, who left his country for the United States last year fearing retribution for his critical views, are concerned about his whereabouts, saying he failed to emerge from Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul on Tuesday.
Khashoggi's Turkish fiancée as well as a close friend contacted by Reuters said he had not exited the diplomatic mission for more than 7-1/2 hours after entering to secure documentation of his divorce so that he could remarry.
The fiancée, who asked not to be named, said she had waited outside the consulate from 1 p.m local time (1000 GMT) and called the police when he had not reappeared.
""I don't know what's happening. I don't know if he's inside or if they took him somewhere else,"" she said by telephone from outside the compound.
Turkish and Saudi authorities, including the Istanbul consulate and the Saudi Embassy in Washington, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Turkey has had strained relations with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states since Ankara stood by Qatar in a regional row.
Turkey has also worked with Iran, Saudi Arabia's arch-rival in the Middle East, to try to reduce fighting in northern Syria and Iranian and Turkish military chiefs exchanged visits last year.
When asked whether the U.S. State Department has sought information from the Saudis and the Turks, an official said, ""We have seen these reports and are seeking more information at this time.""
Khashoggi, a former Saudi newspaper editor and adviser to retired Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki al-Faisal, has lived in self-exile in Washington, D.C., for more than a year.
Since then, he has written columns in the Washington Post criticizing Saudi Arabia's policies towards Qatar and Canada, the war in Yemen, and a crackdown on the media and activists.
""I have left my home, my family and my job, and I am raising my voice,"" he wrote in September 2017. ""To do otherwise would betray those who languish in prison. I can speak when so many cannot.""
Mohamad Soltan, an Egyptian-American activist who sees Khashoggi regularly in Washington, told Reuters that Khashoggi was in the United States on an O-visa, a temporary residency visa awarded to foreigners ""who possess extraordinary ability"" in the sciences, arts, education, and other fields and are recognized internationally, and had applied for permanent residency status.
All public protests are banned in Saudi Arabia, as are political parties. Labor unions are illegal, the media are controlled and criticism of the royal family can lead to prison.
Dozens of activists, clerics and intellectuals have been arrested in the past year in a crackdown on potential opponents of the kingdom's absolute rulers. Among them was economist Essam al-Zamil, a friend of Khashoggi's, who was charged this week with joining a terrorist organization, meeting with foreign diplomats and inciting protests.
Scores of businessmen were detained last November in Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel in a separate campaign against corruption, unnerving some foreign investors. 

Most of them were released after reaching financial settlements with the authorities.

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump made an undiplomatic remark about close ally Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, saying he warned Saudi Arabia's King Salman he would not last in power ""for two weeks"" without the backing of the U.S. military.
""We protect Saudi Arabia. Would you say they're rich. And I love the King, King Salman. But I said 'King - we're protecting you - you might not be there for two weeks without us - you have to pay for your military,'"" Trump said to cheers at a rally in Southaven, Mississippi.
Trump did not say when he made those remarks to the Saudi monarch.
Despite the harsh words, the Trump administration has had a close relationship with Saudi Arabia, which it views as a bulwark against Iran's ambitions in the region.
Trump made Saudi Arabia his first stop on his maiden international trip as president last year. 
Trump called King Salman on Saturday and they discussed efforts being made to maintain supplies to ensure oil market stability and global economic growth, according to Saudi state news agency SPA.
Saudi Arabia is the world's top oil exporter and the de facto leader of OPEC, which has been criticized by Trump for high oil prices.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in New York last month, Trump said OPEC members were ""as usual ripping off the rest of the world.""
""We defend many of these nations for nothing, and then they take advantage of us by giving us high oil prices. Not good. We want them to stop raising prices, we want them to start lowering prices,"" Trump said.

He has also pressed other U.S. allies, such as Japan, South Korea and Germany, to take more of the financial burden of their defense.

FAIR BLUFF, N.C. (Reuters) - The childhood home Katrina Bullock returned to in the rural North Carolina community of Fair Bluff about 16 years ago to care for her sick mother was devastated by flooding from Hurricane Matthew in 2016.
A new roof went up after that. Walls saturated with muddy floodwaters were being replaced and things were looking up until a new storm, Hurricane Florence struck about 23 months later in September.
""We were starting to get it all back together and there comes Florence, and it takes it all again,"" said Bullock.
She and other residents of Fair Bluff, and of many other communities in the southern and southeast parts of North Carolina hit by the double whammy of Matthew and Florence, are sorting through the latest wreckage, wondering if it is worth remaining.
Settlers first arrived in the area around Fair Bluff in the mid-1700s and one of the oldest buildings in Columbus County, where the town is located, is a trading post built on the banks of the Lumber River in the town, according to the local chamber of commerce. In the 19th century, railroads helped keep the economy flowing.
Experts say such hamlets and towns face permanent changes, with fewer residents, fewer businesses and fewer prospects of returning to the way things were just a generation ago. Older residents whose roots run deep and those too poor to leave will soon likely make up the bulk of the population.
Those who can will leave, but others will do their best to rebuild.
""There will be a real desire to make Fair Bluff the best it can be, but it may look and be a different thing from what it has historically been,"" said Patrick Woodie, president of the NC Rural Center, an economic development organization.
Even before Florence hit, many small towns in North Carolina were struggling due to a decline in agriculture and manufacturing. Poverty rates in the state are higher now than in the aftermath of the recession about a decade ago due to the loss of small industries such as textile and a downturn in the farming sector, according to the North Carolina Justice Center, a progressive research and advocacy organization.
Matthew led to catastrophic flooding throughout low-lying eastern North Carolina and caused billions of dollars in damage. In took 28 lives in the United States while Florence killed more than 50 and drove many rural communities into deeper despair.
Fair Bluff is a mostly agricultural community with a Main Street book-ended by two churches and nestled next to the Lumber River, a usually peaceful waterway that flooded during both Matthew and Florence.
The town's small commercial area was struggling to get back into business after Matthew and inundated again with Florence. Many wonder if it will ever open again.
Almost all the stores on Main Street closed after Matthew and when Florence rolled in, the floodwaters brought fresh destruction to places like a furniture shop that had yet to remove all of its water-logged inventory from two years ago.
After the flooding from Florence receded, a dark muck covered floors in affected areas and a smell wafted through the air combining odors of moldy rot and a sewage plant that overflowed in the most recent storm.
Fair Bluff Mayor Billy Hammond believes the town had about 1,000 residents before Matthew and was left with about half that afterward, with many evacuees just never returning. 
The permanent population now is probably about 350 to 400, most of them people whose homes were not flooded, he said.
“It has been a ghost town for about two years,"" he said in an interview. ""We're just going have to take it one day at a time and move forward and hope that people come back,"" he said.
Fair Bluff is about 125 miles (200 km) south of Raleigh. About 21 percent of the population lives below the poverty line and median household income is $28,611, according to U.S. Census data. In Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, home to the vibrant city of Charlotte, median household income is more than double that in Fair Bluff and the poverty rate is about half.
In low-lying areas near the river where some of the poorest people in Fair Bluff live, many have returned to storm-damaged homes because they do not have the money to move or rebuild.A disproportionate number of low-income people live in flood plains in river communities, according to Gavin Smith, a professor in the Department of City and Regional Planning at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Randy Britt, 71, who has lived in Fair Bluff all his life
owns buildings on the Main Street commercial area and is working to re-open a flood-hit store.

""There is always hope. If there wasn’t hope, I wouldn’t be in Fair Bluff right now,"" he said in an interview.

Military sources said last week the country was looking into the possibility of acquiring a system, though President Ivan Duque said the eventual purchase of equipment would not be part of an arms race.
""We are not going to invest 1.1 trillion pesos ($367.4 million) in anti-aircraft defense for the time being, because among other reasons, we do not have the budget,"" Defense Minister Guillermo Botero said during an appearance before Congress. 
Sources told Reuters last week that manufacturers from the United States, France and Israel were in the running to provide the system.
Before the global fall in oil prices, Colombia made some 20 percent of its national income from crude sales. The economy is still recovering from the fall.
The purchase would be part of a renewal program for air force equipment and arms. Despite a 2016 peace agreement with the longtime FARC rebels, Colombia's military remains at war with the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels, drug-trafficking crime gangs and dissident FARC who refused to demobilize under the peace deal.
In 2005 Colombia bought 25 Super Tucano A-29B planes from Brazil's Embraer for $234.5 million, its largest-ever military purchase. At the beginning of 2015 the Andean country added 32 Canadian-made armored vehicles to a unit close to the border with Venezuela, at a cost of $84 million.

135,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>",Brazil investors cheer as support rises for Bolsonaro's election bid,"By Marcela Ayres and Ricardo Brito
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian markets surged on Tuesday as stronger polling for far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro and a Congressional farm caucus endorsement boosted expectations that he may block the leftist Workers Party from returning to power.
The benchmark Bovespa stock index jumped 3.8 percent, flirting with a four-month high, and Brazil's currency, the real, strengthened 1.93 percent, closing below 4 per dollar for the first time in six weeks.
Markets are likely to see more gains on Wednesday after the latest Datafolha poll, released after the bell, showed Bolsonaro extending his first-round lead over the Workers Party candidate Fernando Haddad, and indicating the right-winger could win an expected runoff vote.
That followed an Ibope poll on Monday that also showed Bolsonaro pulling away from Haddad, with a 10-point lead ahead of Sunday's first round.
""Bolsonaro's tide is rising,"" the Guide brokerage firm wrote to clients in a Tuesday research note. ""Many forecast that Bolsonaro would not grow more in the polls. But last night's numbers show the opposite.""
In the likely case of an Oct. 28 runoff vote - required by Brazilian law if no candidate wins a majority in the first round - the Ibope poll showed Bolsonaro in a dead heat with Haddad, while the Datafolha poll gave Bolsonaro a narrow lead.
However, a significant minority of voters remain undecided and rejection rates for both the two frontrunners are high and growing, reflecting the increasingly polarized and febrile atmosphere.
Bolsonaro's history of misogynist comments has riled many women and led to a social media campaign using the #elenao - or, #nothim - hashtag in opposition to him. Last weekend saw the largest female-led street demonstrations Brazil has seen in decades denouncing the candidate.
Yet his support among women overall rose 6 percentage points in the Ibope poll from a week ago. 
Bolsonaro's hardline rhetoric on crime garnered early support from Brazil's farm belt, where booming plantations are threatened by land invasions and robberies. The Parliamentary Agricultural Front, which includes over 260 senators and lower house representatives, formally endorsed their fellow lawmaker on Tuesday.

Bolsonaro celebrated the endorsement in a video released over social media. He pledged to combine the Agriculture and Environment Ministries, which he said would solve many of the farm sector's problems, without elaborating.

The Pentagon said in a statement that it had put its mail facility under quarantine and that the FBI was analyzing the envelopes.
U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the envelopes initially tested positive for ricin after being detected by Pentagon police on Monday at a mail sorting facility on the Pentagon compound but not in the main building.
Separately, the U.S. Secret Service said it was investigating a ""suspicious envelope"" addressed to President Donald Trump that was received on Monday, though it never entered the White House. The agency did not provide further details.
It was not immediately known if the two incidents were related.
Ricin is found naturally in castor beans but it takes a deliberate act to convert it into a biological weapon. Ricin can cause death within 36 to 72 hours from exposure to an amount as small as a pinhead. No known antidote exists.
U.S. government buildings have sporadically received packages with suspected ricin, including in 2013 when ricin-laced letters were addressed to a U.S. senator, the White House and a Mississippi justice official.

Shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York and Washington, D.C., letters containing another deadly substance, anthrax spores, were mailed to the Washington offices of two senators and to media outlets in New York and Florida.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Takako Arai's earliest memories are of Tsukiji, playing hide-and-seek with her brother in the concrete maze of Tokyo's sprawling fish market. Years later, she now runs the family's seafood stall that sells mackerel and yellowfin tuna.
Arai and hundreds of other fish traders are reluctantly packing up and preparing to leave Tsukiji this week for a gleaming new $5 billion market on reclaimed land farther from central Tokyo.
""I feel torn. I grew up here and I feel like we're losing so much of our history by leaving this place,"" said Arai, 45.
The 83-year-old market, a popular tourist attraction, is a warren of shops and warehouses where small turret trucks zip around laden with ice-filled boxes of fish. But city officials say it has become dilapidated and unsanitary.
(Click on https://reut.rs/2O0Fph1 for a photo essay)
Many fishmongers want to stay in the area where they also live. They worry about contaminated soil at the new site in Toyosu, and the difficult commute to the new market.
More than 80 percent of Tsukiji fish traders are opposed to the move, said a survey by a group fighting the relocation.
In a last-ditch bid to delay the move, 56 traders sued the city of Tokyo last month, seeking a temporary injunction. They have asked the court to rule before Tsukiji closes on Saturday.
If there are no delays, business will resume at the new Toyosu market on Oct. 11, but traders worry their customers will not follow them.
Arai, whose family have been fish traders for 95 years, said buyers have already told her the new site is inconvenient.
""They say they're going to buy from other markets nearer to their restaurants,"" she said. ""What can I say? They're business people too.""
Fewer customers will make it hard to recoup the hundreds of thousands of dollars each fish trader expects to pay for the move, including replacing freezers and refrigerators. 
Some 300 fishmongers and activists voiced their anger during a protest at Tsukiji last Saturday, chanting ""Toyosu No No No,"" and waving banners saying ""Stop the Relocation!""
Tourists visiting one of Tokyo's most famous landmarks paused in the rain to join the chants.
""We finally made Tsukiji a famous brand and now they're trying to destroy it,"" said Kiyoshi Kimura, who owns one of Japan's largest sushi chains, Sushi Zanmai. 
His gravelly voice rising as he wept, Kimura recalled opening his first sushi restaurant in Tsukiji 17 years ago in a bid to draw tourists and revive the market. Kimura is famous for his winning bids at the market's New Years auction, where in 2013 he paid a record $1.76 million for a bluefin tuna.
""They have no compassion. That's it,"" Kimura told Reuters. ""These bureaucrats have forgotten that human beings live here. It's all about money for them.""
FINAL DAYS
The relocation plan has been delayed many times since it was conceived 17 years ago. In 2016, toxic substances were found in soil and groundwater at Toyosu, once home to a gas plant.
Tokyo spent an extra 3.8 billion yen ($33.5 million) to dig hundreds of wells to pump out groundwater.
In July, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike declared the new site safe after experts signed off on additional clean-up measures, but some fish traders remain skeptical.
An official with the Tokyo Metropolitan Government said Tsukiji had long supported the city's residents with its lively market, but it was important for that tradition to continue in a new location with better sanitary conditions.
The old Tsukiji site will provide temporary parking for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and eventually become a tourist center.
Tsukiji feels like a village with its own medical clinics, a bank, library and shops, but with some 40,000 workers and tourists passing through on its busiest days.
In its final days, the market is still a frenzy of activity.
Men unload, sort, pack and display thousands of cartons of white boxes filled with fresh fish and seafood trucked in from ports across Japan.
During the early morning auctions, traders use hand signals to buy and sell fish. 
The day's catch is typically carted to a hangar where traders sell their seafood to buyers strolling down the chaotic cobblestone walkways under large store signs.
Koji Amano, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, started working at Tsukiji after dropping out of high school. Now 47, he and two brothers manage a stall specializing in bluefin tuna, or ""maguro,"" considered the king of sushi.
As he filleted a hulk of tuna with a sword-like knife, Amano was resigned to Tsukiji's fate.
""They're determined to move us out,"" he said. ""So there's not much we can really do to stop them.""

139,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 06:15PM ET</span>",Pompeo to visit North Korea again at weekend despite negative signals,"By Lesley Wroughton and David Brunnstrom
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will travel to North Korea at the weekend for denuclearization talks with the country's leader Kim Jong Un, the State Department said on Tuesday, calling this ""forward progress,"" despite negative signals from Pyongyang.
Pompeo will also travel to Japan, South Korea and China from Oct. 6-8, and will be in North Korea on Sunday local time, or Saturday in U.S. Eastern Time.
""I think it shows forward progress and momentum that the secretary is making his fourth trip back in less than a year,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a briefing, referring to the Pyongyang stop. 
""Of course, we have quite a ways to go but we look forward to the next steps in this conversation."" 
Pompeo's visit comes ahead of a planned second summit between Kim and President Donald Trump. The invitation to return to Pyongyang was made during a meeting with North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho on the sidelines of their United Nations General Assembly last week.
Nauert said the stops in Japan, South Korea and China were intended to brief counterparts on the Pyongyang talks. She said he would meet Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Foreign Minister Taro Kono in Tokyo and President Moon Jae-in and Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha in Seoul, while in Beijing he would meet counterparts to discuss ""bilateral, regional and global issues.""
At an unprecedented June meeting with Trump, Kim pledged to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but his actions have fallen short of Washington's demands for a complete inventory of its nuclear weapons and irreversible steps to give up an arsenal that potentially threatens the United States.
Trump has nevertheless hailed progress and on Saturday took his enthusiasm for his detente with Kim to new heights by declaring at a rally with supporters that ""we fell in love"" after exchanging letters.
DEEPENING MISTRUST
Earlier that day, North Korea's Ri struck a different tone, telling the United Nations that continued U.S. sanctions were deepening Pyongyang's mistrust in the United States and there was no way the country would disarm unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri said North Korea had taken ""significant goodwill measures,"" such as stopping nuclear and missiles tests and dismantling a nuclear test site, but there had been no corresponding response from Washington.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korea War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first. Washington has also resisted calls to relax tough international sanctions.
Pompeo's last trip to North Korea did not go well. He left Pyongyang in July hailing progress, only for North Korea to denounce him for making ""gangster-like demands.""
In a commentary on Tuesday, North Korea's official KCNA news agency said declaring the end of the 1950-53 Korean War could ""never be a bargaining chip"" for denuclearization and said experts calling for North Korea to declare details of its arms programs were ""spouting ... rubbish.""
Pompeo had planned to travel to North Korea in August but Trump canceled the trip at the last moment and publicly acknowledged for the first time that his efforts to get Pyongyang to denuclearize had stalled.
Nauert said she did not agree that talks had stalled and when asked if Trump's comments on Saturday had been helpful, replied: ""I think if our leaders have relatively friendly relations, that that's a good thing. That that can only help us to achieve our final goal.""
She said that in the meantime, sanctions would remain in place.
""We are not easing the pressure in that regard at all,"" she said, while responding when asked if Washington was considering any kind of peace declaration: ""We are not. Nothing has changed with regard to our policy.""
Pompeo's trip to China comes at a time of deteriorating relations and tit-for-tat tariffs sparked by Trump's accusations of unfair Chinese trade practices. Last week, Trump accused China of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, saying it did not want his Republican Party to do well.
Reuters reported on Sunday that China had canceled a security meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis planned for October.
Asked if Pompeo would attend the diplomatic side of the so-called Diplomatic and Security Dialogue, Nauert said: ""The trip is, as far as I understand, to have conversations about North Korea and other issues of bilateral concern. I don't have anything beyond that right now.""
""In any relationship you have your high points, you have your medium points and with some countries you have your low points,"" she said. 

""I am not going to characterize our relationship with China in any one of those three ways, but relationships can ebb and flow over time, so we certainly have a lot to talk about with the government of China.""

Nene is a pivotal figure in a probe into the three Indian-born Gupta brothers, who built a business empire during Zuma's nine-year tenure only to see it disintegrate as the scandal-plagued leader was forced out by his own party in February. 
The Gupta family and Zuma have denied any wrongdoing and say the allegations are part of an orchestrated witch hunt.
Zuma fired Nene in December 2015 and replaced him with largely unknown lawmaker Des van Rooyen, sending markets into a tailspin before Zuma appointed investor-friendly Pravin Gordhan as his third finance minister in the space of four days.
Nene has never given details about a dramatic period that revealed to global investors for the first time what was at stake in a battle within the ruling African National Congress over the influence of the Guptas.
Zuma's successor as president Cyril Ramaphosa re-appointed Nene finance minister in February this year.
The long-awaited inquiry into allegations the Guptas used ties to Zuma to win billions of rand's worth of government contracts opened last month with witnesses testifying that the brothers had tried to bribe them or had threatened them. 

Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo leads the public inquiry, which is empowered to make recommendations for prosecutions.

STOCKHOLM/LONDON (Reuters) - A trio of American, French and Canadian scientists won the 2018 Nobel Prize for Physics on Tuesday for breakthroughs in laser technology that have turned light beams into precision tools for everything from eye surgery to micro-machining.
They include the first female physics prize winner in 55 years.
Canada's Donna Strickland, of the University of Waterloo, becomes only the third woman to win a Nobel for physics, after Marie Curie in 1903 and Maria Goeppert-Mayer in 1963.
Arthur Ashkin of Bell Laboratories in the United States won half of the 2018 prize for inventing ""optical tweezers"", while Strickland shared the remainder with Frenchman Gerard Mourou, who also has U.S. citizenship, for work on high-intensity lasers.
""Obviously we need to celebrate women physicists,"" Strickland said shortly after learning of the prize. 
The Nobel prizes have long been dominated by male scientists, and none more so than physics.
Strickland is the first female Nobel laureate in any field in three years. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said last year it would seek to more actively encourage nominations of women researchers to begin addressing the imbalance.
Strickland later spoke of how her predecessor, Goeppert Mayer, had been ""allowed to follow her husband from job to job while he ... went up the ranks as a professor"", while she was only allowed to teach or do unpaid research. 
""Women have come a long way,"" she told a news conference in Canada.
Her win comes a day after Europe's physics research center CERN suspended an Italian scientist, Alessandro Strumia, for telling a seminar at the organization's Swiss headquarters last week that physics was ""invented and built by men"" and that women were now being favored in hiring for research positions.
Jessica Wade, a physicist at Imperial College London who was at the CERN event and unhappy about Strumia's comments, said having a female Nobel winner was also important given the current fight over U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing sexual misconduct allegations.
""This news could not come at a better time,"" Wade told Reuters. ""After a week where a woman has been forced to describe her sexual assault to a live television audience of billions, and an academic at a prestigious university has said that women are unfairly promoted into senior positions in physics, even I – the eternal optimist – was starting to lose hope.""
PRECISION INSTRUMENTS
The inventions by the three scientists awarded this year's Nobel Prize for Physics date back to the mid-1980s and over the years they have revolutionized laser physics.
""Advanced precision instruments are opening up unexplored areas of research and a multitude of industrial and medical applications,"" the academy said on awarding the nine million Swedish crown ($1 million) prize.
Ashkin's work was based on the realization that the pressure of a beam of light could push microscopic objects and trap them in position. A breakthrough came in 1987, when he used the new optical tweezers to grab living bacteria without harming them.
At 96, Ashkin is the oldest ever Nobel prize winner, but he is still busy with fresh research.
""I am busy working right now, writing an important paper on solar energy,"" he told Reuters in a telephone interview.
""I'm surprised,"" Ashkin said about winning the prize. ""A guy called me up on the phone and woke me up.""
Mourou and Strickland's research centered on developing the most intense laser pulses ever created by humans, paving the way for the precision instruments used today in corrective eye surgery and industrial applications.
The prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace have been awarded since 1901 in accordance with the will of Swedish business tycoon Alfred Nobel, whose discovery of dynamite generated a vast fortune used to fund the prize.
Physics is the second of this year's crop of prizes and comes after the medicine prize was awarded on Monday for discoveries about how to harness and manipulate the immune system to fight cancer.
However, for the first time in decades no Nobel Prize for literature will be given this year after a scandal over sexual misconduct allegations saw a string of members leave the board of the Swedish Academy that awards it.

In a speech on the final day of her party's conference, May, who quietly campaigned to stay in the EU in a 2016 referendum, will take aim at critics who accuse her of failing to embrace Brexit.
With only six months before Britain leaves the EU, May is under pressure over Brexit in Brussels and at home, where some of her loudest critics, particularly former foreign minister Boris Johnson, have done little to hide their leadership ambitions.
Her efforts to take back the initiative on Brexit and her party's domestic policy at the conference in the English city of Birmingham have fallen flat, with euroskeptics stealing the limelight with their bid to force her to drop her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit.
Her speech on Wednesday is the last chance at the conference for her to reset her agenda.
""I passionately believe that our best days lie ahead of us and that our future is full of promise,"" she will say according to excerpts of her speech.
""Don't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes: we have everything we need to succeed.""
Describing Brexit as a ""moment of opportunity"", she will promise to always act in the ""national interest"", a swipe at Johnson, whose alternative proposals for leaving the EU, she says, would tear the United Kingdom apart.
With no agreement with the bloc over the divorce or a future relationship, the last day of the conference marks the beginning of what some officials predict will be a frenzied couple of weeks of diplomacy between London and Brussels as the two sides try to secure a deal to end more than 40 years of partnership.
May and her team face weeks of difficult conversations with Brussels to win a deal, but she also faces challenges from inside her own party not just over Brexit but also over what some members call a lack of direction on domestic policy.
Her speech will try to address what many in the governing Conservatives see as a growing threat from the main opposition Labour Party, which staged an upbeat conference last week when its leaders voiced confidence of winning any new election.
Taking aim at Labour's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, she will say that millions of people are ""appalled"" by his leftist policies, which include renationalizing rail, mail and utilities and boosting spending on infrastructure and housing.
""They want to support a party that is decent, moderate and patriotic. One that puts the national interest first,"" she will say. ""We must show everyone in this country that we are that party.""

And playing with Labour's refrain of being the party ""for the many, not the few"", she will add that the Conservatives should be: ""A party not for the few, not even for the many, but for everyone who is willing to work hard and do their best.""

SULAIMANIYA, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraq's parliament on Tuesday elected as president Kurdish politician Barham Salih, who immediately named Shi'ite Adel Abdul Mahdi prime minister-designate, ending months of deadlock after an inconclusive national election in May.
The presidency, traditionally occupied by a Kurd, is a largely ceremonial position, but the vote for Salih was a key step toward forming a new government, which politicians have failed to do since the election.
Under Iraq's constitution, Salih - a 58-year-old, British-educated engineer who has held office in both the Iraqi federal and Kurdish regional governments - had 15 days to invite the nominee of the largest parliamentary bloc to form a government. He chose to do so less than two hours after his election.
Since Saddam Hussein was toppled in a 2003 U.S.-led invasion, power has been shared among Iraq's three largest ethnic-sectarian components. 
The most powerful post, that of prime minister, has traditionally been held by a Shi'ite Arab, the speaker of parliament by a Sunni Arab and the presidency by a Kurd.
A former vice president, oil minister and finance minister, Abdul Mahdi now has 30 days to form a cabinet and present it to parliament for approval. 
He faces the daunting tasks of rebuilding much of the country after four years of war with Islamic State militants, healing its ethnic and sectarian tensions, and balancing foreign relations with Iraq's two major allies - Iran and its arch-foe the United States.
Abdul Mahdi, 76, is a trained economist who left Iraq in 1969 for exile in France, where he worked for think-tanks and edited magazines in French and Arabic. He is the son of a respected Shi'ite cleric who was a minister in the era of Iraq's monarchy, overthrown in 1958.
He will become the first elected prime minister in post-Saddam Iraq not to hail from the Shi'ite Islamist Dawa party.
Abdul Mahdi was nominated by two rival blocs, one led by Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and outgoing Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, and the other by Iran-backed militia leader Hadi al-Amiri and former premier Nuri al-Maliki.
SHI'TE CONFLICT AVERTED
Both blocs claim to hold a parliamentary majority but the dispute has been rendered irrelevant by their choice of the same man to be premier.
""The nomination of Mr Adel Abdul Mahdi came after an agreement between the Binaa bloc and the Islah bloc to nominate him via consensus and not a majority bloc in order to get past the issue of which is the majority bloc,"" said Ahmed al-Asadi, a spokesman for the Binaa bloc led by Amiri and Maliki.
Ameri and Maliki are Iran's two most prominent allies in Iraq. Abadi was seen as the preferred candidate of the United States, while Sadr portrays himself as a nationalist who rejects both American and Iranian influence.
The rival claims to a parliamentary majority and uncertainty over the composition of the new government had raised tensions at a time when public impatience is growing over poor basic services, high unemployment and the slow pace of rebuilding after the war with Islamic State.
Sadr's bloc welcomed Abdul Mahdi's nomination. The cleric earlier on Tuesday tweeted that ""Iraq is bigger than the biggest bloc,"" a likely reference to the compromise.
Abadi issued a statement congratulating Abdul Mahdi and wishing him success.
""Abdul Mahdi's nomination represents the best choice to pleasing all the Shi'ite players who were about to reach a point of conflict and no return,"" said Baghdad-based political analyst Ahmed Younis.
""All the Shiite blocs reached the conclusion that their divisions could lead to an intra-Shi'ite conflict which would weaken their position in Iraqi,"" he said. ""Now with Abdul Mahdi there are no winners and losers, everyone is happy.""
KURDISH TENSIONS
If the nomination of Abdul Mahdi diffused Shi'ite tensions, Salih's election fueled Kurdish ones.
The presidency was fiercely contested between Iraqi Kurdistan's two main parties - the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), which nominated Salih, and its traditional rival, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).
Salih's election raises concerns of destabilisation in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region because of escalating tensions between the KDP and PUK, who fought a civil war in the 1990s.
The KDP and PUK were unable to iron out differences and agree on one candidate as they have traditionally done. They competed in a parliamentary election in their semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq on Sunday. Allegations of fraud have created tensions. Results have not been announced.
""I promise to safeguard Iraq's unity and safety,"" Salih said as he was sworn in, affirming his commitment to the country's unity a year after Kurds overwhelmingly backed a failed independence bid.
He was the preferred candidate of most lawmakers because of his perceived softer stance on the thorny issue of Kurdish independence. 
His opponent had served as the longtime chief of staff to former Kurdistan Region President and KDP leader Masoud Barzani, who ushered in the referendum on independence last year. 
Barzani had struck alliances with several heads of major political blocs in parliament but they were unable to whip the votes for his candidate. 
Salih's election marked the first time in modern Iraqi politics that one of the three top posts was selected without a backroom deal.

""Even though the heads of political blocs wanted to reach a backroom deal rather than leave it up to a vote, they couldn't control their own MPs,"" said Renad Mansour, a research fellow at Chatham House. ""MPs voted for the candidate they thought was most qualified and was most in favor of a united Iraq.""

With six months to go before Britain leaves the EU, May's precarious position at the helm of her party has been tested this week by a conference that further highlighted the deep divisions within her party over how she intends to see Britain leave the EU.
Coveney said that had resulted in a lot of very forceful language on both sides of the Brexit debate within Britain's ruling Conservative party but that much of that was for domestic and internal political party consumption.
The European Union - which is deadlocked in negotiations with Britain over how to avoid the return of a hard border between Ireland and British-ruled Northern Ireland post-Brexit - should instead be ""calm and sensible"" and not get dragged into that debate, he said.
""As soon as this conference is over I hope we will get back to the kind of professional negotiations that had been going on before the Tory party conference to get what needs to be done in the next couple of months over the line,"" Coveney told reporters.

""That will be our focus and not taking the bait from comments that are somewhat inflammatory.... I think we would be foolish to get drawn into distractions. What's needed now is to ensure that the commitments that have been made by the British government are actually going to be followed through.""

The meeting will be held in the Sicilian capital Palermo on Nov. 12 and 13, with key players from both within Libya and abroad expected to turn up, Moavero told parliament.
""We want to find a common solution, even though there will be different opinions around the table,"" Moavero said, adding that the goal was to help restore peace in Libya and facilitate an inclusive political process ahead of possible elections.
Italy has been tussling with neighboring France over how best to deal with Libya, which has been racked by violence for years following the NATO-backed uprising in 2011 that overthrew strongman Mummar Gaddafi.
Libyan leaders announced at a conference in Paris in May that they would hold elections on Dec. 10 as part of a French drive to stabilize the North African country.
Italy bristled at the move to fix a date in the face of continued clashes between rival factions, and few Western diplomats believe the vote can go ahead in the current climate. 
Moavero said he did not expect the Palermo meeting would focus on specific dates. ""No deadlines will be imposed or tasks set for the Libyans,"" he said.
INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT
U.S. President Donald Trump has given his blessing to the Italian conference and Moavero said he would fly to Moscow next Monday to discuss the situation in Libya with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. 
Rome expects high-level delegations from Libya's neighbors as well as from the Gulf, Turkey and the European Union.
However, it was still not clear if Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar, a dominant figure in the east of the country, would show up in Sicily.
Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) last year seized the country's second largest city, Benghazi, by expelling Islamist and other fighters. 
In an interview with Reuters published on Tuesday, Haftar said he still supported plans for national elections in Libya in December but accused other players of not fulfilling their promises that would have paved the way for a ballot.
Italy has thrown its weight behind Haftar's main rival, Prime Minister Fayez Seraj, who leads a U.N.-brokered transitional government based in the Libyan capital Tripoli.

Moavero met Haftar last month and said on Tuesday that the commander had confirmed ""his interest in the conference"".

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four men linked to a white supremacist group were arrested on Tuesday in connection with the white nationalist rally that turned deadly in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year, authorities said.
Benjamin Drake Daley, 25, Michael Paul Miselis, 29, Thomas Walter Gillen, 34, and Cole Evan White, 24, were arrested in California and were to be transported to Charlottesville after making initial appearances in federal courts in California on Tuesday, U.S. Attorney Thomas Cullen said at a news conference.
They were each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the federal riots statute and one count of violating the federal riots statute.
U.S. Justice Department officials said the men had traveled from California to incite a riot and bring violence to the August 2017 rally in the Virginia college town. 
They said the men were part of an organized, militant white supremacist group, named in the criminal complaint as the ""Rise Above Movement."" 
Each man faces 10 years in prison if found guilty, according to authorities.
""This case should serve as another example of the Department of Justice’s commitment to protecting the life, liberty, and civil rights of all our citizens,” Cullen said.
Reuters could not immediately ascertain if the men had retained counsel. 
Cullen said he expected a trial could start as soon as the end of the year.
Authorities decided the men's alleged activities could be prosecuted under a federal statute on riots, instead of laws prohibiting hate crimes, but Cullen said there may be other charges against them. 
Hundreds of people descended on Charlottesville in August 2017 to protest the removal of a statue honoring Robert E. Lee, a commander of the Confederate Army in the U.S. Civil War, in what was billed as a Unite the Right rally. 
The 2017 rally drew international attention when James Alex Fields Jr. was accused of driving into a group of people, leaving 32-year-old Heather Heyer dead and dozens injured. Fields was charged with the killing in June. He has pleaded not guilty.
At the time of the rally, President Donald Trump was condemned by Democratic and Republican political leaders for saying that ""many sides"" were to blame for the violence.
According to the criminal complaint, which was filed under seal in August, the FBI used ""open-source research,"" including the Rise Above Movement's public Twitter page, to help investigate the four defendants. 

The FBI alleged in the complaint that the men had previously taken part in acts of violence at rallies in Huntington Beach and Berkeley, California.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Russia must halt its covert development of a banned cruise missile system or the United States will seek to destroy it before it becomes operational, Washington's envoy to NATO said on Tuesday.
The United States believes Russia is developing a ground-launched system in breach of a Cold War treaty that could allow Russia to launch a nuclear strike on Europe at short notice, but Moscow has consistently denied any such violation.
U.S. ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison said Washington remained committed to a diplomatic solution but was prepared to consider a military strike if development of the medium-range system continued.
""At that point, we would be looking at the capability to take out a (Russian) missile that could hit any of our countries,"" Hutchison told a news conference.
""Counter measures (by the United States) would be to take out the missiles that are in development by Russia in violation of the treaty,"" she added. ""They are on notice.""
Hutchison later clarified in a tweet that she was not talking about a preemptive strike against Russia. ""My point: Russia needs to return to INF Treaty compliance or we will need to match its capabilities to protect US & NATO interests. The current situation, with Russia in blatant violation, is untenable.""
The 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty bans medium-range missiles capable of hitting Europe or Alaska.
In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the United States had for some time argued that Moscow was not in compliance with the treaty.
""What Ambassador Hutchison was talking about was improving overall defense and deterrence posture,"" Nauert told a news conference. ""The United States is committed to upholding its arms control obligations and expects Russia to do the very same thing,"" she said, adding that the U.S. was discussing the issue with its allies.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said that such statements were dangerous, and that it would provide detailed answers to Washington.
""It seems that people who make such statements do not realize the level of their responsibility and the danger of aggressive rhetoric,"" TASS news agency quoted spokeswoman Maria Zakharova as saying.
In the past, the ministry has said it is ready for talks with the United States to try to preserve the treaty and would comply with its obligations if the United States did.
But that same year, the U.S. State Department report found Russia had violated obligations ""not to possess, produce, or flight-test"" a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 km to 5,500 km (310-3,420 miles), ""or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles."" 
The U.S. accusations are likely to further strain relations between Moscow and the West that are at a low over Russia's 2014 seizure of Crimea, its bombing campaign in Syria and accusations of meddling in Western elections.
""We have been trying to send a message to Russia for several years that we know they are violating the treaty; we have shown Russia the evidence that we have that they are violating the treaty,"" Hutchison said.
""We are laying down the markers so that our allies will help us bring Russia to the table,"" she added.
U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said he would discuss the issue with his NATO counterparts at a scheduled two-day meeting in Brussels from Wednesday.

""I cannot forecast where it will go, it is a decision for the president, but I can tell you that both on Capitol Hill and in State Department, there is a lot of concern about this situation and I'll return with the advice of our allies and engage in that discussion to determine the way ahead,"" he told reporters in Paris.

The information minister said last month that two separate shipments of cash containing a total of $104 million -- or about 5 percent of the west African nation's gross domestic product -- went missing over the past year.
The scandal has saddled President George Weah with his biggest political crisis since he took office in January. Weah ordered an investigation and more than 30 former bank officials were barred from leaving the country.
But in a statement on Tuesday, central bank governor Nathaniel Patray said an internal audit found that all the notes shipped from the Swedish printer between 2016 and 2018 were properly accounted for and stored in the bank's reserve vaults.
Thousands of Liberians protested on the streets of the capital Monrovia last week.
Among those hit with travel bans are former central bank governor Milton Weeks and Charles Sirleaf, the son of former president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. 

Weeks has said he had nothing to do with the missing cash and is cooperating with investigators. Reuters has not been able to reach Charles Sirleaf or his mother for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is reviewing ways to clamp down on the export of U.S. technology that China's government could use in its surveillance and internment of minority Muslims, amid reports of mass detentions of ethnic Uighurs and others in the Xinjiang region.
In a letter to the leaders of a congressional committee, seen by Reuters on Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said his department, in consultation with the State Department and other agencies, could announce export policy changes within weeks.
""We are conducting this review expeditiously and expect to publish amendments to the EAR (Export Administration Regulations) later this fall,"" Ross said in the letter to Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Chris Smith.
Ross said the review included assessing whether to add Chinese individuals, businesses and others to a list of entities subject to special license requirements, revising licensing policy and updating technologies controlled for the protection of human rights.
Any sanctions decision would be a rare move on human rights grounds by President Donald Trump's administration against China, with which it is engaged in a trade war while also seeking Beijing's help to resolve a standoff over North Korea's nuclear weapons.
Rubio and Smith, the Republican leaders of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, wrote to Ross in September urging the administration to broaden sanctions on China over its treatment of minority Muslims.
Ross' letter was a response to that letter.
The State Department expressed deep concern last month over China's ""worsening crackdown"" in the Xinjiang region, as officials considered sanctions against Chinese senior officials and companies linked to allegations of human rights abuses.
China has called for other nations to respect its sovereignty, saying Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions.

Morocco's interior ministry gave lower figures, saying 31 people had been rescued and that 11 bodies had been recovered on Monday
All migrants on board the boat came from sub-Saharan Africa, the ministry said in a statement, adding that investigations showed the organiser of the risky crossing was from Mali.
""The boat was adrift since Sunday with 60 people aboard. At least 34 have drowned, it looks like there were 26 survivors,"" Joel Millman, spokesman of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), told Reuters.
The information came from the Moroccan navy and a Spanish non-governmental organisation, Caminando Fronteras (Walking Borders), he added.
Helena Manelo, founder of Caminando Fronteras, said the Spanish coast guard had called her early on Monday after being contacted by the captain of the boat whom they were unable to understand.
""They were asking for help because their inflatable boat was damaged,"" the Morocco-based Spanish activist told Reuters.
Morocco and Spain cooperate closely at the security level to crack down on trafficking networks but they are not doing enough to save lives at sea, Manelo said.
In an incident on Oct. 26, the Moroccan navy fired at a speedboat carrying Moroccan migrants after it refused to stop, killing a young woman and injuring three migrants.
Commenting on that incident, Morocco's Prime Minister Saad Eddine El Othmani said the navy had not seen the migrants because they were hiding in the boat.

Venezuelans have been crossing into countries across the region to escape food and medicine shortages and a deep economic crisis. Many have settled in Colombia, with which Venezuela shares a porous eastern border.
Nearly one million Venezuelan immigrants already live in Colombia, which has a total population of around 50 million. Their presence could cost the Andean nation about 0.5 percent of its gross domestic product in healthcare, education and infrastructure spending, the government said last week. [nL2N1WE17T]
""In a scenario where the situation worsens, we're talking about 4 million Venezuelans in Colombia,"" Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said at a migration forum in Bogota, citing a worst-case scenario estimate from a government study he said will be published next week. ""Resource requirements would be 26.57 trillion pesos ($8.87 billion)."" 
""We're facing the magnitude of this challenge, which our country has never seen before,"" Trujillo said, adding that under the worst-case scenario, Colombia ""would be obliged to make budget allocation adjustments on the order of 10.5 percent in the coming years.""
More than 2 million Venezuelans have left their country in recent years, with most arriving in neighboring South American nations, according to the United Nations migration agency.
Affected countries have repeatedly asked for more aid to help them cope with migrants' needs. Many Venezuelans arrive with nothing more than what they can carry.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and other top officials of the ruling Socialist Party have dismissed those migration figures as stemming from politically-motivated alarmism and ""fake news"" meant to justify foreign intervention in the country's affairs.

The former ruling Republican Party was toppled in spring following weeks of mass protests against corruption and cronyism. 
Pashinyan, the former opposition leader, became prime minister in May, appointed allies as ministers and submitted a new government program which promised early elections and was approved by the parliament in June.
The latest protest was triggered by parliament's sudden decision on Tuesday to approve changes to parliamentary regulations which may delay such elections.
The changes were supported by Republicans and also two factions, Prosperous Armenia and Dashnaktsutyun, which had supported Pashinyan during the unrest earlier this year.
Speaking to the rally on Tuesday, Pashinyan promised to sack six ministers in his government from Prosperous Armenia and Dashnaktsutyun and said he would meet lawmakers to discuss the situation.
He said he wanted elections to be held in the first half of December, adding that the composition of parliament did not reflect the country's political reality.
""Holding early parliamentary elections was one of the conditions of our velvet revolution and was included in the government program, which was approved by the parliament,"" Pashinyan told the protesters.
Public support for parties not affiliated with Pashinyan is currently very low - not only for the Republicans but others including Prosperous Armenia and Dashnaktsutyun.
The My Step Alliance, which includes Pashinyan's Civil Contract Party, won 81 percent of the mayoral vote in Yerevan last month.
Early parliamentary elections can be called in the ex-Soviet country of three million people if parliament fails twice to choose a new prime minister and the legislature is dissolved.

Pashinyan said he was ready to resign so that this procedure could be implemented and elections held.

Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told President Vladimir Putin during a meeting broadcast by Rossiya 24 TV: ""The work was finished a day ago,"" adding that the system would improve the security of Russian military personal in Syria. 
Russia decided to supply the system after Moscow accused Israel of indirectly causing the downing of a Russian military jet near Syria in September.
Israel voiced regret at the death of 15 Russian air crew while saying Syrian incompetence was at fault and that it was compelled to continue taking action against suspected deployments of Iranian-backed forces across its northern border.

""We will not allow Iran to open up a third front against us. We will take actions as required,"" he told Israel Radio.

The White House previously said it hoped Russia would reconsider the move, which U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton called a ""significant escalation"" of Syria's seven-year-old war.

154,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 02:59PM ET</span>",U.S. high court mulls death penalty for killer who forgot crime,"By Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices, delving into the issue of aging prisoners with dementia, struggled on Tuesday over whether a convicted Alabama murderer should be spared the death penalty because strokes have erased his memory of committing the crime.
Vernon Madison, 68, was convicted and sentenced to death for fatally shooting a Mobile police officer in 1985.
During an hour of arguments, the justices heard from both Alabama and Madison's attorney that severe cognitive decline could preclude a state from executing inmates who cannot understand what was happening to them. But it remained unclear whether the justices will decide Madison fits that criteria. 
The justices, on the second day of their new term, must determine whether executing Madison would violate the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. A ruling is due by June.
Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, a death penalty critic, said there are many aging inmates who, like Madison, have spent decades on death row.
""So this will become a more common problem,"" Breyer said.
The Supreme Court has previously imposed limits on capital punishment for mentally incompetent or intellectually disabled people. 
Madison suffered several strokes in recent years, resulting in brain damage, dementia and memory impairment, according to court papers. He is legally blind, cannot walk unassisted and speaks with a slur. 
The dispute centers on whether Madison can understand the connection between his crime and the planned punishment. Alabama has said Madison can understand the link. A federal appeals court ruled last year that he cannot. 
The justices ruled last year that Alabama could execute Madison, but on Jan. 25 they then halted his execution and a month later agreed to hear his case.
Madison shot Julius Schulte, a police officer in Mobile, twice in the back of the head as Schulte supervised Madison's move out of his former girlfriend's house, according to court papers.
Attorneys for Alabama and Madison told the justices memory loss alone cannot exempt someone from execution. 
Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, asked Madison's attorney Bryan Stevenson whether he conceded that ""simply blacking out, you don't remember the crime"" was not enough.
""It doesn't make them incompetent,"" Stevenson agreed, but asked the justices to bar execution when ""someone has a disability that renders them incapable of orienting to time or place.""
Liberal justices including Sonia Sotomayor appeared to agree Madison should be spared, but conservative Justice Samuel Alito noted that experts evaluating the case said Madison understands the meaning of the death sentence and certain other details. 
""Nothing about Mr. Madison's conditions impact the state's interest in seeking retribution for a heinous crime,"" Alabama Deputy Attorney General Thomas Govan said. 
The court, one justice short amid the fight over President Donald Trump's nominee Brett Kavanaugh, is currently split 4-4 between conservatives and liberals.
Madison, who is black, was sentenced to death in 1994 in his third trial. His first two convictions were thrown out on appeal for racial discrimination in jury selection and other prosecutorial misconduct.

It was not immediately clear whether minister Arsen Avakov was citing information from Ukrainian intelligence or quoting the accounts of journalists. He released a statement following a meeting with a British minister.
His spokesman declined to comment further. A lawyer for former President Viktor Yanukovich, who escaped to Russia in February 2014 during a wave of street protests, has previously denied that the Skripal suspect had helped Yanukovich. 
Former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found slumped on a public bench in the English city of Salisbury in March. Britain says they were poisoned with a nerve agent administered by Russian intelligence officers.
The Skripals survived, but a woman who lived in the area, unconnected with them, later died from what British police say was contact with the poison used, which her partner had found in a discarded perfume bottle.
Russia denies any involvement in the affair, which has deepened its international isolation.
Moscow says two Russian men suspected by British authorities, captured on surveillance footage near the scene of the poisoning, were innocent tourists visiting Salisbury twice during a weekend trip to Britain. London says that explanation is so far-fetched as to all but prove Russia's involvement. 
""Interior Minister Arsen Avakov noted that one of the participants in the attack in the Salisbury, an officer of the GRU of the Russian Federation, had been recognised in Ukraine as a person who had been involved in transporting ex-president Yanukovich from Ukraine,"" the minister's statement said.

156,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 02:29PM ET</span>","Turkish court upholds life sentences for journalist Ahmet Altan, five others: Anadolu","ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish court upheld life sentences on Tuesday for prominent journalist Ahmet Altan and five others, the state-run Anadolu news agency said, after they were sentenced in February on charges of aiding plotters of a failed military coup in 2016.
Ahmet Altan, his brother Mehmet Altan and four other journalists were previously sentenced to life in jail for alleged links to the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, accused by Ankara of orchestrating the 2016 coup attempt.
Mehmet Altan was released from prison in June, but his sentence was also upheld on Tuesday, after a penal court rejected the constitutional court's request for his release.
The Altans' trial has underscored concerns about human rights and press freedom in Turkey under a post-coup crackdown, as well as worries over the independence of the judiciary under President Tayyip Erdogan.
Since the abortive putsch, more than 50,000 people have been jailed and 150,000 sacked or suspended from their jobs, while more than 120 journalists have been detained and about 180 media outlets shut down.
Rights groups and Turkey's Western allies have voiced concern that the government has used the putsch as a pretext to quash dissent, but the government has said the measures were necessary due to the gravity of the security threats it faces.
Ahmet Altan was charged over comments he made the day before the coup attempt, when he told a television show: ""Whatever the developments were that led to military coups in Turkey, by making the same decisions, Erdogan is paving the same path"".
On the same programme, Mehmet Altan referred to ""another structure"" within the government that was closely watching developments to ""take its hand out of the bag"".
Prosecutors said the brothers' comments were coded messages to call Gulen's followers to action, and were charged with ""violating the constitution"", according to Anadolu.
All six journalists in the case are serving aggravated life sentences, which means they are not eligible for parole and cannot be included in future amnesty decisions.

Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, was among at least 1,230 people who died in the devastating 7.5-magnitude quake and tsunami that hit Sulawesi island.
When disaster struck, Agung did not follow others leaving the crumbling four-storey control tower at Palu airport.
Agung's last words, according to pilot Ricoseta Mafella, were: ""Batik 6231, runway 33, clear for takeoff.""
""He was saying it in a very calm manner, because the earthquake hadn't started yet,"" Mafella told Reuters.
Then the earthquake struck.
“I felt that the aircraft was moving slightly to the right and to the left,” Mafella said.
Agung waited for the plane, bound from Palu to Makassar, to become airborne before leaving the control tower, authorities said. 
""He stayed... until the last of my departure, until the tower was shaking very bad,"" Mafella added. ""Once he made sure that the aircraft had departed safely, he jumped from his tower to the lower level.""
The air traffic controller broke his arm, leg and ribs in the fall and died from his injuries, authorities said. 
Air Navigation Indonesia said in a statement that it would posthumously raise Agung's rank by two levels as a sign of appreciation. The company tweeted out images showing Agung's body being carried to a helicopter during his funeral procession in Makassar.
Indonesians praised Agung online, with many saying his story had brought them to tears. Several artists created tributes in his honor that were widely circulated on social media.

""I think he did a very heroic action, he did his job professionally, and I think he should be honored,"" Mafella said. ""I call him my guardian angel.""

ACCRA (Reuters) - Melania Trump cuddled a baby, handed out teddy bears and beamed smiles on her first day in Africa on Tuesday, kicking off a four-country visit and receiving a warm welcome on a continent her husband once referred to derisively.
The U.S. first lady touched down at mid-morning in Ghana's capital, Accra, where she was greeted by her counterpart, Ghana's first lady Rebecca Akufo-Addo, and a young girl who offered her flowers.
A welcoming ceremony of drums and dancing by men and women dressed in traditional attire followed. Trump clapped her hands for the performers and waved at a group of schoolchildren who had gathered for her at the airport.
The trip is Trump's first major solo outing abroad as first lady. She has accompanied President Donald Trump on foreign visits, but she chose Africa for her first multi-nation trip alone. She will visit Kenya, Malawi and Egypt before returning to the United States at the end of the week.
Her immediate predecessor Michelle Obama also made a solo trip to the continent when her husband was president, visiting South Africa and Botswana.
Trump's trip did not generate the same fanfare. 
""I did not know she's in town until I heard about it on the radio a few minutes ago,"" Cynthia Brobbey, a saleswoman at a popular retail shop near the airport told Reuters, three hours after the first lady's arrival in Accra.
But she received a warm response at a local hospital, where she cooed over children, distributed stuffed animals and held a baby in her arms. She later joined Akufo-Addo for tea. 
Trump has focused on children as her signature issue and plans to promote child wellbeing during her four-country tour.
President Trump has been quoted as saying immigrants from Africa came from ""shithole countries"". He denied making the remark.

He recently weighed in on South Africa's efforts to fix racial disparity in land ownership, saying on Twitter he had asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to study the country's ""farm seizures"" and the ""killing of farmers"".

JALALABAD, Afghanistan (Reuters) - A suicide bomber blew himself up at an election rally in Afghanistan's eastern province of Nangarhar on Tuesday, killing at least 13 people and wounding more than 30, officials said, warning that the toll was likely to climb.
Campaigning for the Oct. 20 parliamentary election began on Friday and security officials have warned of the danger of militant attacks during the campaigning.
The parliamentary election, delayed by three years, comes amid rising violence nationwide.
Attaullah Khogyani, spokesman for the provincial governor in Nangarhar, said at least 13 bodies were taken to hospitals, but others said the toll was likely to be higher.
""Elders were speaking at the meeting when there was suddenly a huge blast,"" said Sayed Humayoun, who had been at the rally in Kama district, outside the provincial capital Jalalabad.
""I was knocked unconscious but when I opened my eyes there were bodies scattered all around the blast area,"" he said, adding that he could see dozens of dead and wounded.
Around 250 people had been at the rally, said Sohrab Qaderi, a member of the provincial council, adding that at least 30 were killed and dozens more wounded.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement carried by its Amaq news agency. The group has claimed a series of attacks this year that have killed scores of people in Nangarhar, on the border with Pakistan.
Another explosion took place at a cricket ground in Nangarhar's Bati Kot district on Tuesday afternoon. 
""Seven children aged between 12 and 15 years were injured in the blast at the playground,"" Khogyani said. 
The parliamentary election is seen as both a dry run for the more important presidential election next year, and a test of the government's ability to provide security.

Officials say sustained violence could delay the process if it becomes unsafe for voters to go to polling stations.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Rebels in northern Syria who have rejected plans for joint Russian-Turkish patrols of a demilitarized zone said on Tuesday that Ankara had assured them no Russian forces would patrol the area.
Presidents Vladimir Putin and Tayyip Erdogan agreed last month to set up the zone between rebel and government fighters, staving off a government attack on the area which the United Nations had warned could cause a humanitarian catastrophe.
The agreement announced in Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi on Sept. 17 would establish the zone in a 15-20 km (10-12 mile) wide strip of territory now held by rebels, and calls for joint patrols of the area by Russian and Turkish troops.
But the rebels are deeply distrustful of Russia, President Bashar al-Assad's most powerful ally. The planned presence of Russian forces in the neutral zone is one of several issues that anti-Assad factions say trouble them over the agreement, which also requires the withdrawal of insurgents deemed ""radical"" by Turkey from the area by Oct. 15.
The main jihadist group in the Idlib area, Tahrir al-Sham, has yet to say whether it will comply with the agreement.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in an interview broadcast on Tuesday that Damascus believed ""Turkey is capable of carrying out its obligations"" in Idlib. 
Turkey has long backed rebel groups opposed to Assad but has joined Russia in recent months in seeking a diplomatic solution to the conflict.
Rebels aligned with Turkey said they had held talks with Turkish intelligence and military officers in the past 48 hours, and had made clear they objected to Russian patrols. 
Ankara had given the rebels assurances there would be no such patrols, Sheikh Omar Hutheifa, a leader of the Turkey-backed National Front for Liberation (NFL), told Reuters.
""The request to the Turkish brothers was that this cannot be agreed to ... this was a red line that cannot be breached,"" he said. ""The last position (by Turkey) is that there would be no entry of Russian troops.""
There has been no comment from Russia on the issue. Turkish officials were not immediately available for comment.
Another opposition figure said Ankara was seeking to persuade Moscow that patrolling such a zone would be fraught with risks and it would be best left to Turkey to enforce the agreement alone on the ground.
Turkey already has a dozen military positions in the Idlib region set up under an agreement with Russia and Iran - Assad's other major ally - to observe a ""de-escalation"" zone. It has been beefing up these positions, and has said more troops will be deployed into the region.
""The proposal is that the Turkish army with its heavy weapons would effectively take the place of the rebel factions,"" a rebel commander who attended meetings with the Turks over the zone said.
Putin has said that all opposition heavy weapons, mortars, tanks and rocket systems are to be removed from the zone by Oct 10.
""We will stay in our trenches and our bases,"" said Captain Naji Abu Huthaifa, spokesman of the Turkey-backed NFL. ""We don't trust the Russians and expect they won't abide by the deal at any moment.""
The Syrian foreign minister Moualem, speaking to the Lebanese channel al-Mayadeen, said militants in Idlib needed to surrender their heavy and medium-sized weapons before December.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Taiwan on Tuesday accused China of trying to make the island nation ""irrelevant"" in the world community, after Beijing and the Vatican signed a landmark agreement improving ties.
Matthew Lee, Taiwan's ambassador to the Vatican, made the dig in a speech during a reception marking Taiwan's national day that was attended by Vatican officials, including several directly involved in the negotiations with China.
""Communist China remains committed to making the Taiwan people irrelevant to the United Nations and to excluding Taiwan from playing a meaningful role both in the United Nations family and in the international communities,"" he said.
On Sept. 22, the Vatican and Beijing signed a provisional agreement giving the Holy See a long-desired say in the appointment of bishops in China.
In the first concrete sign of a thaw after the signing of the agreement, the Vatican announced on Monday that Beijing would for the first time allow Chinese bishops to attend a major Vatican meeting, known as a synod, that starts on Wednesday.
Although the Vatican insists its deal with Beijing is not political - which Lee emphasized in his speech - diplomats say it is likely a precursor to the Vatican eventually switching diplomatic recognition to Beijing.
Lee, adopting a Biblical comparison, said his country was David and China was Goliath.
""With the assistance of global partners standing up to the rising autocratic authoritarian power (of Beijing) Taiwan will persist, persevere and prevail,"" Lee said.
The ranks of those partners has been thinning, however.
The Vatican is Taiwan's last remaining diplomatic ally in
Europe. The self-ruled island has formal relations with 16 other countries, many of them small, less developed nations in Central America and the Pacific.
Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a renegade province, has
routinely accused China of using dollar diplomacy and bullying
to lure away its allies, charges Beijing has denied.
Since the 1970s, following the United Nations vote to recognize the People's Republic of China as the sole legal China, the Vatican has not appointed a nuncio, or ambassador, to Taiwan. It has since kept the status of its mission in Taipei at the lower level of ""charge d'affaires ad interim,"" which diplomats say is to placate Beijing. 
Critics have labeled the agreement between the Vatican and Beijing, which was in the making for more than 10 years, as a sellout to the Communist government.
China's approximately 12 million Catholics have been split between an underground Church swearing loyalty to the Vatican and the state-supervised Catholic Patriotic Association.

Despite the recent agreement, Beijing has not taken any action on long-held Church concerns over clerics in detention, Catholic Church sources familiar with the matter have said.

The notice, published under the heading ""caravan of the Shuhada"" or martyrs, showed a picture of a smiling young bearded man it identified as Abu Hamza al-Maqdisi. 
Maqdisi, a Palestinian, was in charge of the group's planning and training operations in Sinai, it said without giving any detains on how he was killed, when or where.
There was no immediate comment from the Egyptian military on the report, but security sources said Maqdisi died along with two other people early on Monday in an air strike on their vehicle near Sheikh Zweid in northern Sinai. 
The Egyptian military and police have been conducting an operation in Sinai since February to crush militants affiliated with Islamic State. The operation came after an attack on a mosque last November that killed hundreds of worshippers.
The military has said hundreds of suspected militants have been killed as well as dozens of soldiers in the operation, which involves thousands of troops backed by heavy weapons and the air force.

Iran fired six missiles at targets in the Abu Kamal and Hajin regions in eastern Syria, in retaliation for an attack on a military parade in Iran on Sept. 22 that killed 25 people, nearly half of them members of its Revolutionary Guards.
The Quds Force is in charge of the Revolutionary Guards' overseas operations. 
""Based on the information we have received, around 40 top leaders of Daesh were killed in this attack,"" General Amirali Hajizadeh, head of the Guards' aerospace division, was quoted on Tuesday by Iran's state media as saying. ""Daesh"" is a derogatory Arabic acronym for Islamic State.
""One of the highlights of this operation was that the Quds force had provided the intelligence needed for the attack.""
The Islamic State and the Ahwaz National Resistance, a separatist ethnic Arab movement in Iran, have both claimed responsibility for the Sept. 22 attack, but neither has presented conclusive evidence.
Iranian military support has been vital to helping Syrian President Bashar al-Assad through his country's civil war. Iran has dismissed U.S. demands that it leave Syria.

(Reuters) - Chilean President Sebastian Pinera will meet Pope Francis in Rome later this month during a tour of Europe, as the Roman Catholic Church in Chile faces a crisis over claims of sexual abuse and cover-ups. 
A spokesman for Pinera said he will meet the pontiff at the Vatican during a tour of France, Spain, Germany and Belgium that begins on Friday. A Vatican spokesman confirmed the meeting would take place on Saturday morning.
The spokesman for Pinera declined to discuss who had requested the meeting or what would be discussed but said the president would visit Italy only for the purpose of seeing the pope. 
Pinera, a Catholic who presides over a right-wing party with traditionally close ties to the Church, has remained largely silent on Chile's abuse crisis. His uncle is Bernardino Pinera, 102, a retired cleric who is the oldest living Catholic bishop. 
So far the pope has accepted the resignations of seven of Chile's 34 bishops and Chilean civil justice has investigated 119 allegations of sexual abuse or cover-ups involving 167 church workers including Cardinal Ricardo Ezzati, the archbishop of Santiago.
Last month, Pinera told a church service to celebrate independence day that he hoped the local Catholic Church would face the ""dark times"" and learn from them. ""The church knows more than anyone that it was wrong,"" he said. 

Ezzati is due to be questioned on Wednesday by a civilian prosecutor over allegations he covered-up child abuse. The cardinal has maintained his innocence.

BRUSSELS/BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - ""Unworkable"", ""unacceptable"", ""impasse"" - the words used to describe Brexit talks between Britain and the European Union do little to temper concerns that the two are heading for a chaotic divorce.
But behind the scenes, both sides are preparing concessions as part of what one British official called ""a constructive dialogue"" that could yet lead to a deal.
Officials and sources on both sides say there is a clear will to try to overcome the obstacles to winning a withdrawal deal and agreeing a framework for future ties - a deal on the Northern Ireland border and EU-UK trade.
The EU will start putting in writing its offer for future trade ties, as Britain has pressed for after feeling Prime Minister Theresa May was snubbed at talks in Austria last month. 
The official agenda of the bloc's executive Commission, published on Tuesday, shows it will discuss an ""outline of a new partnership with the United Kingdom"" on Oct. 10. 
Britain has promised to bring a new proposal to unlock a standoff over preventing the return of border checks between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland, possibly by compromising about regulatory controls on goods in exchange for Brussels embracing the use of technological fixes for customs checks. 
With only six months to go before Britain leaves the bloc, the lack of clarity over the divorce has spooked markets fearful of a no-deal Brexit, which both sides say they are working to avoid.
On Wednesday, May gives a speech to end a fractious annual conference of her Conservative Party, where Brexit rebels have done much to undermine her stance of maintaining close ties with the EU.
On Thursday, Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar will be in Brussels for talks with the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.
Senior diplomats in Brussels have been summoned to a Brexit meeting on Friday and Barnier will present an initial draft of the bloc's trade proposal soon after, which the EU hopes will woo Britain into compromises. 
No new dates have been confirmed for the next round of negotiations between Barnier and British Brexit minister Dominic Raab, but several EU diplomats said they expected them to take place in Brussels next week. 
TIGHT SCHEDULE
""It must be next week or it's too late to get anything done within our six-week schedule,"" one said, referring to a plan to have a preliminary Brexit deal at the next EU leaders' summit on Oct. 18. 
The remaining 27 EU states are due to host a summit on Nov. 17-18 to sign off on any agreement with Britain. Otherwise, they will switch to contingency mode to prepare for a no-deal Brexit in which Britain leaves next March with no agreements in place to mitigate the economic shock.
British officials have signaled new ideas will come. A focus will be attempts to come to agreement over customs arrangements on the island of Ireland to prevent the emergence of a ""hard border"", which inflamed sectarian conflict in the past.
Raab said at the Conservative conference he welcomed Barnier's suggestion that technology could be used to help resolve the issue, after London said it could not accept the bloc's proposal for Northern Ireland to effectively stay in the EU's customs union.
He also said Britain was looking at how regulatory checks on some goods could be used as part of a solution to move talks forward.
Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, on whose support May relies to govern, swiftly said it would not accept different regulations to the rest of the UK after Brexit.

Brussels dismissed a fix proposed by London in June. EU diplomats stressed they have not yet seen the new British plan.

The Catholic Church worldwide is reeling from crises involving sexual abuse of minors, deeply damaging confidence in the Church in Chile, the United States, Australia and Ireland among other countries.
In January, a court ordered the Catholic Church to pay compensation to a woman who had been sexually abused by a priest as a child.
""The verdict of the Court of Appeal legally decides to award one million zloty compensation ... and an annuity of 800 zloty a month,"" the court statement said.
State news agency PAP reported last year that a priest had abused a 13-year-old girl during his tenure in northwestern Poland.
The man, who imprisoned and raped the girl for more than 10 months, was arrested in 2008 and sentenced in 2010 to four years in prison, Gazeta Wyborcza daily reported.
The victim successfully sued The Society of Christ Fathers for Poles Living Abroad after she refused to accept the financial offer from the congregation to which the priest belonged.
Poland's episcopate declined to comment on Tuesday while a spokesman for the Society of Christ Fathers for Poles Living Abroad said it was working on a statement.
""This is the first time the court in Poland recognized the Church as being co-complicit in such a crime,"" Marek Lisinski, head of the ""Nie lekajcie sie"" foundation aimed at helping priest-pedophiles' victims, told Reuters. 
""For sure it will give other victims courage to fight for justice and a faith that it is possible to win even against such a moloch,"" he added.
Pope Francis is battling to address the issue worldwide and will meet with senior Catholic bishops at the Vatican in February to discuss the protection of minors.

Stubb wrote in a letter to fellow members of the European People's Party (EPP) that he was a ""declared pro-European"" who had decided to run to defend European values and to push Europe to fill a power vacuum left by the ""voluntary marginalization"" of the United States and Britain from world politics.
""It is time to rally around our cause for a strong Europe. This means mitigating unnecessary divisions between East and West, North and South. We must be better at highlighting what unites us instead of what differentiates us,"" he wrote. 
Stubb, 50, has been prime minister, finance minister and foreign minister of Finland and is currently a vice president at the European Investment Bank.
The EPP, the largest trans-national group in the EU legislature, will choose its election leader at a meeting in Helsinki on Nov 7-8. Stubb will challenge Germany's Manfred Weber, head of the EPP group, and possibly other conservatives.
The only other declared candidate is Slovak Socialist Maros Sefcovic, who is Juncker's vice president for energy.
The European Parliament has demanded that the European Commission president should be one of the parties' lead candidates, as happened for Juncker in 2014. Polls show that the EPP is likely to remain the biggest group in the chamber.
However, French President Emmanuel Macron and other leaders, who would actually nominate Juncker's successor, oppose the automatic linkage between the EU election and the Commission job. 
In this case, the leaders could select someone to head the Commission who is not one of the parties' picks, although that person would still need to be approved by the parliament.
With a host of other EU posts to be filled in the coming year, notably that of European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, government leaders are engaged in a delicate game of strategy over which to seek for compatriots or political allies.

The EU parliament vote, held against a backdrop of Brexit and increasing nationalist complaints against Brussels in other countries, will determine the make-up of an important element in making laws applied across the continent.

The assembly also backed a motion allowing all six parliament members, who have either fled Spain or are in jail, to delegate their voting rights to a party member, a spokesman for the Catalan parliament said.
In July, Spain's Supreme Court effectively stripped Puigdemont and the other separatist politicians of their public duties due to their role in organizing an independence referendum on Oct 1, 2017.
Tuesday's moves by the Catalan assembly came a day after riot police charged in to break up a demonstration in front of the parliament building after thousands marched in Barcelona to mark the first anniversary of the referendum.
Madrid imposed direct rule on Catalonia after the referendum, which it branded as unconstitutional. It then called fresh regional elections in December in a bid to curb the independence movement, but the plan backfired and the secessionists retained a slim majority in the Catalan assembly.
Opinion polls in Catalonia show a relatively even split between those who favor remaining in Spain and those wanting to secede.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has said he favors dialogue on Catalonia's future but has ruled out any moves towards independence.

Lemlem was banned from living in the town area, it added. 
The prosecutor's statement also accused him of fraudulently farming out the local waste management to two co-operatives rather than carrying out the required tenders and said a broader enquiry would look into the possible mismanagement of public funds, earmarked for migration projects.
With Lucano as mayor, Riace has made headlines for opening its doors to thousands of refugees, integrating them into society and revitalizing a dwindling rural population. 
Over 3000 citizens of Riace's 2,000 inhabitants currently are immigrants, deputy mayor Giuseppe Gervasi told Reuters. He said that over the years the town had welcomed hundreds more but that many had then moved on to other European countries, including Britain, Norway and Sweden.
Riace's model jars with a clampdown on irregular immigration by the national government, which last week approved a decree aimed at cutting the number of asylums granted and doubling detention time for irregular migrants.
""Gosh, I wonder what ... all the goody-goodies that would like to fill Italy with migrants will say,"", Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said on Twitter in reaction to news of Lucano's house arrest. 
Since taking office in June, Salvini has led a campaign to stop the movement of humanitarian rescue ships out of Italy's ports. The party he leads, the far-right League, has promised to deport hundreds of thousands of irregular migrants.
Deputy Minister Luigi Di Maio said there should not be political speculation over the arrest and that the government had no role in the investigation, but that the event should rather raise the issue of transparency in the management funds for migrants.
Lucano, who has been mayor since 2002, was listed by Fortune as one of the world's top 50 leaders in 2016. It was not immediately possible to reach his lawyer.
His house arrest led to uproar on social media. Writer Roberto Saviano said on Twitter that Lucano was guilty only of ""disobeying and saving human lives and welcoming them (migrants).""
""... (Lucano's) model of integration for migrants has been long under attack, and today his arrest is on the grounds of the paradoxical accusation of favoring illegal immigration,"" said Fiom, the biggest Italian metalworkers union, in support of the mayor.
The group called for national mobilization against racism and in favor of migrants' rights to live and work in Italy.

178,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",Far-right surge in Bavaria vote could reshape Germany's national politics,"By Madeline Chambers
NUREMBERG, Germany (Reuters) - The right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) is poised to humiliate Chancellor Angela Merkel's allies in an Oct. 14 vote for Germany's most influential regional government, an election that could have far-reaching implications for national politics.
With blunt anti-Islamic rhetoric and attacks on Merkel's migrant policy, the AfD is expected to muscle into the regional parliament in Bavaria for the first time.
That could help end one of the iron laws of post-war Germany: the near total domination of one of the richest and most populous states by a regional conservative party that has used its clout there to wield outsized national power for decades. 
Polls point to the Christian Social Union (CSU) losing its absolute majority and securing only about 35 percent of the vote. The biggest winners would be the Greens and AfD on about 16 percent and 12-13 percent respectively.
""We will inflict pain on the big parties. That's what motivates us. The chancellor has nothing more to give,"" Wolfgang Doerner, a 57 year-old businessman and AfD candidate for the Bavarian assembly told a cheering crowd of supporters in medieval Nuremberg, Bavaria's second biggest city.
""This vote will be felt in Berlin as well as Munich,"" Doerner told mostly male delegates in a modern concert hall.
The CSU has fallen short of an absolute majority in Bavaria's state assembly only once since 1954, when it missed by two seats in 2008. Its vote share, usually close to 50 percent, has not fallen below 43 percent in 64 years.
That regional power has assured Bavarian CSU leaders a solid grip on senior cabinet positions in the conservative national governments that have dominated post-war Germany.
If the polls are right, the vote will be a heavy blow to CSU leader Horst Seehofer, who props up Merkel's coalition government in Berlin and serves as interior minister.
GATEWAY
The AfD already entered Germany's national parliament last year and has seats in all but one of its other state assemblies. But the Bavaria surge is particularly important because of the pressure that puts on Seehofer, and by extension Merkel.
Bavaria has been the gateway by which most of the 1.5 million asylum seekers who reached Germany in the past three years entered the country. The CSU under Seehofer has positioned itself well to the right of Merkel's own national CDU party on immigration in an effort to beat back an AfD threat.
Regional AfD leader Martin Sichert thinks his party will still exceed opinion poll forecasts.
""I am cautious about trusting polls because people try to demonize and stigmatize the AfD. We are the baddies and in telephone polls, people don't admit to voting for us,"" Sichert told Reuters in an interview in Berlin.
""We're not a right wing party, we represent views shared by the majority of people on border controls and Islam not belonging to Germany,"" said Sichert, a 38-year old businessman who has a seat in the Bundestag lower house of parliament.
Such language resonated with backers in Nuremberg. 
""We just speak the truth. I don't want my country to go to the dogs, I don't want it to go Islamic,"" said 71-year Gregor, previously a CSU voter, who did not want to give his surname.
Since August, when the eastern city of Chemnitz was hit by Germany's most violent far-right protests in decades, the AfD has faced extra scrutiny over accusations that it harbors extremists. 
Joerg Meuthen, co-leader of the federal party, told the conference that a few ""idiots"" who did ""stupid things"" in Chemnitz -- like make the outlawed Hitler salute -- had stigmatized the rest.
Outside the conference hall, 3,000 ""Alliance against the AfD"" protesters described the AfD as a potent threat, especially after a senior conservative in eastern Saxony for the first time left open the option of sharing power with it, which Merkel and the CSU have ruled out.

""I fear the CSU and AfD will be the biggest parties in the election and then they will work together,"" said protestor Bettina Heck, 39. ""They make themselves sound reasonable in public, but underneath, they are radical and dangerous.""

As she lay dying in a puddle of blood, Silva used her last breaths to tell her daughter to run and hide. But despite her fear of being killed, Lopes stayed with her mother. 
""I waited with her until the final moment, by her side,"" Lopes told Reuters, as tears streamed down her face. 
""I couldn't bear it,"" Lopes said, of when she got to see her mother's corpse later that day. ""I saw her lying there and she looked like a doll, asleep. The only thing I could take with me were the earrings she was wearing.""
Brazil's violence is spiking and ever more victims are caught in the crossfire. Widespread insecurity has become a key theme in the Oct. 7 election, and helps explain the rise of frontrunning far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who wants to loosen gun laws and take the fight to violent gangs. 
Rio de Janeiro state registered over 4,500 murders during the first eight months of 2018, up 6 percent compared with the same period in 2017. 
More than 1,000 people died in confrontations with police in the state between January and August, official data shows, up over 50 percent on the same period in 2017. Authorities say those killed are mostly suspected drug gang members, while critics allege innocent people are also slain.
In March 2017, 13-year-old Maria Eduarda Alves was at a sports class in her school in Rio's Pedreira neighborhood when shots rang out. As teachers tried to shepherd their students back inside classrooms, Alves received a fatal wound.
Two police officers were later charged with the girl's killing. A cellphone video, uploaded to social media and filmed by someone near the school, also showed the policemen executing two alleged gangsters who were injured during the shootout. 
""I'm still not alright. I still feel ... a lot of sadness,"" said her mother, Rosilene Alves, wearing a T-shirt that read ""Positive Vibration,"" as she pointed at the bullet hole that perforated the school's entrance and killed her daughter. 
""Life goes on, but it's not easy.""
Alda Rafael Castilho, a 27-year-old police officer, was killed when assailants attacked her police station in the violent Penha slum complex in 2014.
""This doesn't end,"" said her mother, Maria Rosalina Rafael da Silva, 65. ""Young people dying, families being destroyed. And I can say that because I've been destroyed.""

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Gay bar owner and novelist Alex Andronic fears a referendum this weekend in Romania that aims to prevent same sex couples ever securing the right to marry not only darkens his future, it will also stir an intolerable level of hate and discrimination. 
Romania does not allow marriage or civil partnerships for same sex couples. Nonetheless, the country will vote on whether to narrow the constitutional definition of marriage from a union of spouses to one between a man and a woman.
The referendum, which needs a 30 percent turnout rate was brought by a civil society group called the Coalition for the Family, which said the gender-neutral term ""spouse"" could see gay couples win the right to marry in the future. 
It gathered 3 million signatures to generate the vote.
""Take the rights I'm already not benefiting from if it calms you down, brings you closer to God, tradition and family welfare,"" wrote 25-year-old Andronic in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post. 
""Do exactly as you feel. Because I know what it's like to be unable to do as you feel.""
His viral post drew support but also an outpouring of hateful, graphic and sometimes threatening comments illustrating the worrying rise in harassment and hate speech directed at Romania's LGBT community.
Dozens of human rights groups, which are encouraging people to boycott the ballot, have warned it will embolden further attempts to chip away at the rights of minority groups and push the European Union state onto a populist, authoritarian path.
The referendum needs 5 million votes to be valid.
Most EU countries allow either same sex marriages or civil partnerships, but Romania, whose populist government of Social Democrats and a junior coalition partner endorsed the vote, does not even recognize those performed abroad.
""This referendum gave people a reason to spread as much hate as possible and we will suffer because of it,"" said Andronic in the garden of his bar in downtown Bucharest.
The initiative is backed by the Orthodox Church and other religions and won support from all but one political party in parliament.
The Coalition also supports cancelling subsidies for contraception and elective abortion, forcing parents of minors to have counseling if they want to divorce, and lowering some taxes for married couples.
""We must understand how much our vote is needed, how much our children and grandchildren need our protection to defend their rights and future,"" it has said. 
Some campaign posters and ads are falsely urging people to vote ""Yes"" or run the risk of gay couples stealing or adopting their children. The Orthodox Church has said a ""Yes"" vote would be Christian, democratic and patriotic.
""This brings hate speech from the fringes to the mainstream with an impact on all groups in society, and the rights of all minorities will be put under question,"" said Vlad Viski of LGBT rights group Mozaiq.
Earlier this year, Romania needed a European Court of Justice ruling to grant residency rights to gay spouses married in other EU states.
Romania decriminalized homosexuality in 2001, decades later than neighboring countries. It ranks 25th out of 28 EU states based on legislation, hate speech and discrimination against LGBT, an annual study by ILGA-Europe, an umbrella organization advocating equality, showed. 
""Since this referendum was approved the number of transphobic episodes I've encountered has more than doubled,"" said Antonella, a 28-year-old transgender woman who is also part of the ethnic Roma minority at a rally in late September.

""We existed in the past, we will exist in the future, we must have a say.""

182,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 07:52AM ET</span>",France seizes Iranian assets in retaliation for bomb plot,"By Richard Lough and John Irish
PARIS (Reuters) - France seized assets belonging to Iran's intelligence services and two Iranian nationals in response to a June plot to attack an exiled Iranian opposition group's rally outside Paris, the government said on Tuesday.
A senior French official said Paris had no doubt that elements of the Iranian state were behind the bomb plot and that it was likely to have been hatched by hardliners looking to undermine President Hassan Rouhani.
The hardening of relations between Paris and Tehran could have deep consequences for Iran, coming at a time when Rouhani's government is looking to European capitals to salvage a 2015 nuclear deal after the United States pulled out.
""An attempted attack in Villepinte was foiled on June 30. An incident of such gravity on our national territory could not go unpunished,"" said a joint statement by the foreign, interior and economy ministries.
Asked for reaction, a spokesman at the Iranian Embassy in Paris replied simply: ""Hello. Thank you."" There was no immediate response to the French move from Tehran.
The plot targeted a meeting of the Paris-based National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) outside the French capital. U.S. President Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and several former European and Arab ministers attended the rally.
It unraveled after an Iranian diplomat accredited in Austria was arrested in Germany and two other individuals in possession of explosives were detained in Belgium.
On Monday, a court in southern Germany ruled the diplomat could be extradited to Belgium.
TARGETED ASSET FREEZES
The asset freezes targeted two individuals identified as Assadollah Asadi and Saeid Hashemi Moghadam, the French statement said. A unit within the Iranian intelligence services was also targeted.
The French government gave no details of the assets involved, describing its measures as ""targeted and proportionate"". It said it had acted against the ""instigators, authors and accomplices"" of the foiled attack. 
France had warned Tehran to expect a robust response to the thwarted bombing and diplomatic relations were becoming increasingly strained. 
French President Emmanuel Macron and Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian spoke to their Iranian counterparts about the issue at the U.N. General Assembly after demanding answers over Iran's role.
An internal French foreign ministry memo in August told diplomats not to travel to Iran, Reuters revealed, citing the Villepinte bomb plot and a toughening of Iran’s position toward the West.
Paris has also suspended nominating a new ambassador to Iran and not responded to Tehran nominations for diplomatic positions in France.
The deterioration of relations with France could have wider implications for Iran. 
France has been one of the strongest advocates of salvaging the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw Tehran agree to curbs on its nuclear program in return for a lifting of economic sanctions. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has said it expects renewed sanctions to impact the Iranian economy hard.

183,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",UK Conservatives gripped by 'Mogg-mania' as diehard eurosceptic draws the crowds,"By Kylie MacLellan
BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Sighing at the sight of a queue of hundreds of people that snaked its way around the conference center and out of the door, one Conservative Party member complained: ""They should have put him on the main stage"".
The hot ticket? Not Prime Minister Theresa May or any of her ministers, but a pro-Brexit rally with leading eurosceptic lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg. It was a scene that played out every time he appeared at an event on the sidelines of the conference.
With less than six months to go until Britain leaves the EU, May is yet to reach an exit deal and with her future uncertain, it is her potential successors who are drawing the crowds at the party's annual conference. 
Rees-Mogg, a millionaire who cultivates the image of an English gentleman, received a celebrity welcome; asked to pose for selfies with delegates and mobbed by press photographers. 
Fellow eurosceptic Boris Johnson, the bookmaker's favorite to replace May, is the only one to challenge him in the popularity stakes. Rees-Mogg backed Johnson for the leadership in 2016, before the former London mayor withdrew. 
Johnson ranks well above Rees-Mogg in grassroots website ConservativeHome's poll of who should be the next leader, but with the former foreign secretary only appearing at conference for one day, it was Rees-Mogg who had the enduring following.
""To those of you who I overtook in the queue, my apologies for queue-barging. I've always thought it is very un-English to push ahead to the front of the queue so you are all very kind to let me come in,"" Rees-Mogg greeted the crowd.
Asked why he is such a draw, Rees-Mogg fans repeatedly used the same words to describe the willowy, bespectacled 49-year-old: ""honest"", ""decent"" and ""genuine"".
""He just tells it as it is,"" said Sonia Gosbee, a Conservative member from Kent in southeast England, who turned up to see Rees-Mogg speak two days running.
""People like Jacob Rees-Mogg ... they listen to what is going on but they still keep their steel, I think Theresa May has lost her steel.""
""DYING DUCK""
Chairman of the influential European Research Group of anti-EU Conservative lawmakers, Rees-Mogg received a rapturous round of applause as he rubbished May's Brexit plans.
""It is not only a dying duck in a thunderstorm it is the deadest dying duck in any thunderstorm,"" said Rees-Mogg, dressed in his trademark double-breasted suit.
He favors a free trade deal based on the one agreed between the EU and Canada -- something May says would create an unacceptable border between Northern Ireland and the rest of mainland Britain. If not Canada, Rees-Mogg wants World Trade Organization terms. 
""Don't fear leaving on world trade terms,"" he urged. ""We would be able immediately to get on and trade with the world. We wouldn't have an implementation period ... 21 months of vassalage.""
Rees-Mogg, who received a standing ovation, said that outside the EU, Britain could do more to help the poorest in society, getting rid of tariffs on some clothes and food and curbing low-skilled immigration.
When one man shouted ""sack the woman"" at mention of May, Rees-Mogg quipped ""certainly not"". Asked if he would run for leader if May was toppled, he said the party should back her.
""I know, I know,"" he said when they booed his answer. 
""I understand why there is concern but ... it would be very hard for anybody to push through a really ambitious Brexit policy at this stage,"" he said, citing the slim majority the Conservatives, supported by a small Northern Irish party, have in parliament.
Some have reservations. His opposition to abortion and same sex marriage, rooted in his Roman Catholic faith, distances him from the modern liberal consensus in Britain. Some lawmakers call him ""the honorable member for the 18th Century"".
""I detest his social views but he has the right opinions on where we should go with Brexit,"" said one Conservative member.
Many beyond the party see him as out of touch but it is the Conservative members who get to select the next prime minister if May goes, and his supporters believe he can win people round. 
Lisa Parker, a Conservative councillor from Rugby in central England, queued for two hours to hear Rees-Mogg speak and planned to do the same for fellow grassroots favorite Johnson when he appears on Tuesday.

""If the country could see what we saw in the last hour they'd be as charmed as we all were and impressed by just how much he loves this country,"" she said of Rees-Mogg. Would she like to see him as leader? ""I still have a soft spot for Boris,"" she said, smiling.

184,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",Libya's Haftar still supports elections but sees others stalling,"By Ayman al-Warfalli
BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar, a key figure in the future of the troubled North African country, still supports plans for national elections in December but says other players are not fulfilling their part for the vote to take place.
His downbeat comments to Reuters add to growing doubts that a French plan, backed by the United Nations, to hold elections aimed at ending seven years of conflict in the oil producer will go ahead.
Haftar is a dominant figure in the east where his Libyan National Army (LNA) last year seized the second-largest city of Benghazi by expelling Islamist and other fighters.
The 75-year old, in written comments to questions submitted by Reuters, refused to say whether he would run in presidential elections as expected, saying only: ""Which elections are you talking about ? When they are announced and the door opened to run for them, you will know the answer."" 
Haftar is aligned with a government based in the east and is the main rival of Prime Minister Fayez Seraj who leads a U.N.-brokered transitional government based in Tripoli, the capital. 
In May, Haftar, Seraj and the leaders of rival parliamentary assemblies agreed verbally under French mediation in Paris to create a framework for elections.
But weeks of clashes between rival factions in Tripoli, some of which are linked to the U.N.-backed government, have shown the difficulties of organizing a vote in a country in chaos.
""The General Command (of the LNA) has not backed down on what it has pledged (regarding elections), and we are ready to play our part in securing elections on the agreed date,"" Haftar said in the written response provided by his office.
""But the rest of the parties have breached their commitments ... and have not taken any steps to fulfill their role,"" he added.
He said the House of Representatives had failed to agree on a constitutional framework by mid-September as planned. The chamber is based in eastern territory controlled by the LNA but is itself badly divided.
For weeks, the HOR has postponed sessions with only few lawmakers showing up. Some have complained about intimidation and violence -- one deputy was recently shot in a leg.
""We have now exceeded this date (Sept.16) without any action and without any justification,"" Haftar said.
HIS TITLE: FIELD MARSHALL
Previous attempts at peace deals have been scuttled by divisions among rival groups and its foreign backers.
Haftar enjoys the support of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates which are keen on curbing Islamists. He remains popular with those tired of chaos but is seen by others as divisive, especially in western Libya.
Libya slid into lawlessness after the NATO-backed uprising in 2011 that overthrew Mummar Gaddafi.
Haftar launched a campaign in May 2014 in Benghazi that lasted three years, styling himself as a military leader capable of restoring order. He enjoys the official title of ""field marshal"".
Critics say he wants to resurrect Gaddafi's former police state, accusations he denies.
Haftar said the situation in Tripoli remained dangerous despite U.N. attempts to establish a truce between armed groups. 
The LNA has talked about expanding to Tripoli but this might entail him having to team up with other armed groups in western Libya.

Germany, whose Nazi past makes military action a sensitive issue, has mainly carried out limited engagements abroad since World War Two, focusing on training, surveillance, medical rescue and peacekeeping, although it participated in the 1999 air offensive on what was then Yugoslavia.
Germany's air force will end the flights by Oct. 31, 2019, the document showed, without giving a reason for the decision.
Parts of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), who are junior partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition, have raised scepticism toward the flights.

The lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, will have the final say on the continued deployment of up to 800 German troops in the region. 
The German aircraft taking part in the reconnaissance and refueling missions are currently stationed at Azraq air base in Jordan.

186,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",Alternative Brexit conference shows threat to UK PM May from party rebels,"By Alex Fraser
BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - A day after Prime Minister Theresa May urged her party to use their annual conference to unite behind her Brexit plans, rebel lawmakers were running out of patience with her decision to proceed with proposals many feel do not make a clean enough break from the EU.
A few streets away from the main conference venue in the English city of Birmingham, eurosceptic lawmakers told Reuters her so-called ""Chequers"" plans were dead and that parliament would vote them down.
""We would be failing to deliver the referendum mandate under the Chequers proposal,"" said Priti Patel, a former minister in May's government, referring to the 2016 referendum in which Britons voted 52 to 48 percent to leave the EU.
""There can be no halfway house,"" she told Reuters. ""We promised the British public that we were going to leave the European Union."" 
With less than six months before Britain is due to leave the EU, there is still no full exit agreement and eurosceptic rebels in her party are threatening to vote down a deal even if May clinches one.
The fate of May's government and her Brexit plan is in doubt because it is unclear whether she can command the 320 votes she needs in the House of Commons, the lower house of the British parliament, to approve a deal.
During the event, billed as the alternative Brexit Advance Coalition Conference, audience members were asked to vote on who would be best to lead the party.
Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of a faction of Brexit hardliners in May's party, came top of the poll with 49 percent of the vote in the room. May only received 1 percent.
Ninety-six percent of those attending said they opposed her plans for leaving the EU.
""It never ever represented the instructions that the British people gave in the referendum,"" said Bill Cash, a veteran Eurosceptic lawmaker.
Andrea Jenkyns, who resigned from her role within May's government as a parliamentary private secretary over the summer, said Brexit was now in danger of being scuttled by the government. 
""Our party members don't want it, the public doesn't want it, the opposition aren't going to vote for it, the EU doesn't want it, so we must chuck Chequers,"" she said.
But lawmakers and members said they do not want a snap election or a replacement for May as prime minister just yet.
""We are determined not to have another election,"" said Daniel Kawczynski, a lawmaker for a region in western England. ""I think it would be the height of folly and irresponsibility to keep going back to the people with more general elections and more referenda.""
But Kawczynski said if the prime minister refuses to deviate from her plan then he would consult the opinion of his constituents and party members.
""If she can't bring along people who are in this audience and people in my association, then of course her position would ultimately be precarious,” he added.

Mahathir, who at 93 became the world's oldest head of government after starting his second stint as prime minister in May, has for decades been accused of anti-Semitism for his attacks against Jews, whom he has accused of perpetrating a humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories.
""If you are going to be truthful, the problem in the Middle East began with the creation of Israel. That is the truth. But I cannot say that,"" he said in an interview on BBC's Hard Talk.
Calling Israelis ""special"", Mahathir, prime minister of Muslim-majority Malaysia, challenged historical accounts that six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, arguing that the figure was four million.
When asked why he described Jews as ""hook-nosed"" in his book The Malay Dilemma, he said: ""They are hook-nosed. Many people called the Malays fat-nosed. We didn't object, we didn't go to war for that.""
The Anti-Defamation League, a U.S.-based organization against anti-Semitism, was not immediately available for comment but called out Mahathir's ""decades-long record of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories"" in a tweet in May.
""The world cannot accept this from any leader,"" the tweet read.

Last week, when addressing the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Mahathir said the world ""rewards Israel"" for breaking international laws and committing acts of terrorism against Palestinians.

NY-AALESUND, Norway (Reuters) - On the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, the sun does not rise for four months of the year and it is so cold that no trees grow there.
But Norway, which has sovereignty over Svalbard, fears tensions between Russia and the West could spill over to this frozen and barren outpost because of growing interest in the Arctic's valuable oil, gas and shipping routes.
The Nordic country has been lobbying its partners in NATO to focus on collective defense of its territory rather than interventions outside its borders -- and it has paid off. 
Norway will be the central staging ground of Trident Juncture, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's biggest military exercise since 2002.
For two weeks from Oct. 25, 40,000 troops from 30 countries will conduct air, sea and land operations from Finland and the Baltic Sea in the east, to Iceland in the west. A command post exercise -- involving commanders and their staffs at headquarters -- will then be held from Nov. 14-23.
Oslo has also persuaded Washington to more than double the number of U.S. Marines present in Norway. Hundreds will from next year be sent to Troms, an Arctic region closer to Russia than the Marines' current base in central Norway. 
""We see that there is no reason to believe that potential tension could start in the Arctic, but it could easily end up here if it starts elsewhere,"" Norwegian Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide told Reuters.
""And that is of course due to Russia building up their military capacity, especially on the Kola Peninsula,"" she said in Ny-Aalesund, a research station on Svalbard that is the world's northernmost permanent settlement.
Norway has a 196-km (122-mile) land border with Russia and Russia's Northern Fleet has its main base in Severomorsk, about 100 km from the border with Norway on the Kola Peninsula, a region dotted with naval bases and restricted military zones.
NATO fears Russia's military build-up in the Arctic, under way in the Arctic since 2008 and involving the creation and reopening of six military bases, could reduce the alliance's freedom of navigation.
Russia, which staged its largest military maneuvers since the Cold War in eastern Siberia in September, has also shown signs of concern about the military situation in Norway. It sees the plan to send more U.S. Marines there as an unfriendly act which could have ""consequences"".
""This makes Norway less predictable and could cause growing tensions, triggering an arms race and destabilizing the situation in northern Europe,"" the Russian Embassy said in a statement on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page in June.
RUSSIAN INTERESTS
Norway has meanwhile been boosting economic activity on Svalbard, which is in the Arctic Ocean midway between continental Norway and the North Pole. 
Svalbard's traditional industry, coal mining, is not profitable so Oslo has increased tourism, scientific research and fisheries there. 
Russia also has an interest in Svalbard. Under the 1920 treaty that gives Norway sovereignty over the archipelago, citizens of all signatories to the treaty can settle there without a Norwegian visa. This includes Russia.
There are 467 Russians registered as living on Svalbard and a Russian coal mining company has for decades operated in the town of Barentsburg. Another Russian settlement, Pyramiden, is now abandoned but is on the tourist trail as a Soviet ghost town.
Svalbard has moved up NATO's agenda because of Russia's annexation of the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and Moscow's frequent naval exercises in the Arctic. 
Norway, which was a founding member of NATO but is not a member of the European Union, has been beefing up its forces because of the Russian military buildup. 
It has ordered 52 F-35 fighter jets from  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), is rebuilding infrastructure to support them and is ordering four new submarines from Germany's ThyssenKrupp. It is also building up a cavalry battalion in a military base in the Finnmark region bordering Russia.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow will not threaten anyone from the Arctic but that it is taking measures to guarantee its security. 
The modernization of the Northern Fleet includes the addition of 23 new vessels including two nuclear submarines, the Russian defense ministry website quoted Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of Russia's armed forces, as saying.
Gerasimov said Russia had ""restored its presence in the strategic regions of the Arctic Ocean and ensured security of its economic activity."" 
By the end of this year, the Northern Fleet is set to receive weapons and equipment including five military ships, 15 planes and 62 radar facilities and air defense complexes, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu was quoted as saying in August by Russian Zvezda TV channel.
In addition, coastal defense troops are supplied with three ""Bal"" and ""Bastion"" missiles divisions. New military airdromes are being built and others are being modernized by Russia.
The Russian Foreign Ministry did not respond to requests for comment. 
U.S. WANTS TO 'UP ITS GAME'
The U.S. military has also attached increasing importance to the Arctic, especially as global warming opens up new sea lanes and oil and mineral reserves.
""Certainly America's got to up its game in the Arctic. There's no doubt about that,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said this year. 
Mattis visited Norway in July for talks with Soereide and Defence Minister Frank Bakke-Jensen. The deployment of additional Marines was confirmed the following month. 
Oslo and Moscow concluded a deal in 2010 to end a dispute over their maritime border, enabling oil and gas exploration and allowing for visa-free travel permits for residents of the border areas.
But since Russia's annexation of Crimea, Norwegian military and government officials have increasingly voiced concern, including about Russia simulating bombing raids on Norwegian targets and adopting quieter submarines that are harder to detect.
Norway is also worried Russia would be able to block NATO troop movements or reinforcements by taking control of the so-called GIUK gap -- an area in the northern Atlantic Ocean between Greenland, Iceland and Britain.
Speaking in August on the arrival of German troops, tanks and equipment for the Trident Juncture maneuvers, Frank Bakke-Jensen said the global and regional security environment had fundamentally changed.

""We need to take the old NATO mission -- securing the North Atlantic and communications and supply lines across the Atlantic. This is what we're exercising now, how to move big amounts of troops, vehicles and vessels,"" he told Reuters.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian police on Tuesday fired tear gas and water cannons to halt and scatter a march by thousands of protesting farmers heading for the capital, New Delhi, to demand better prices for their produce.
Reeling from a crash in commodity prices, more than 50,000 farmers from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, a top producer of wheat and cane, blocked part of the main highway to the capital.
They also sought loan waivers, cheaper power and tougher action to get sugar mills to pay dues owed for their cane, as discontent in rural areas turns to anger against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who faces tough general elections next year.
""Despite our repeated requests, the government has failed to help farmers in any meaningful ways,"" a farm leader, Dharmendra Malik, told Reuters by telephone from the protest site.
""Left with no choice, we've decided to march to Delhi to highlight our plight.""
Cash-strapped sugar companies owe cane growers about 135 billion rupees ($1.9 billion) in the current season. Saddled with huge piles of sugar and hit by a fall in prices, mills have said they are unable to pay farmers on time.
Television broadcast images of angry farmers clashing with police and driving their tractors into security barriers, in a protest that disrupted rush-hour traffic.
Some farmers were injured when police fired tear gas and water cannon to keep protesters from breaking through barricades to reach New Delhi, the site of events to mark the birth anniversary of India's apostle of non-violence, Mahatma Gandhi.
Farmers had started trickling into the city late on Monday, prompting authorities to bar gatherings of more than four people. 
The government has allowed police to ""brutally beat up"" the farmers, said the opposition Congress party, which ruled India for most of its 70 years since independence from Britain, before losing power to Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party.
""Can India's farmers not come and tell their own government that they are in deep pain?"" asked Congress spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala.
Modi’s rural woes have been worsened by a failure to deliver on a promise of tens of millions of jobs for young people that helped him win the largest mandate in three decades in 2014.

The case of Andrew Brunson, whose next regular court hearing is on Oct. 12, has become the most divisive issue in a worsening diplomatic row between Ankara and Washington that has triggered a punishing regime of U.S. sanctions and tariffs against Turkey.
""We will appeal tomorrow to the Constitutional Court to lift the house arrest,"" lawyer Ismail Cem Halavurt told Reuters on Tuesday.
The evangelical pastor is charged with links to Kurdish militants and supporters of Fethullah Gulen, the cleric blamed by Turkey for a failed coup attempt in 2016. He has denied the accusation - as has Gulen - and Washington has demanded his immediate release.
On Monday, President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey was determined to fight, within legal and diplomatic frameworks, ""this crooked understanding, which imposes sanctions using the excuse of a pastor who is tried due to his dark links with terror organizations.""
Halavurt said he did not expect the constitutional court to make a ruling before the Oct. 12 hearing, ""but we want to have completed our appeal before (then)"".
Brunson, who has lived in Turkey for two decades, has been detained for 21 months on terrorism charges and is currently under house arrest.
Donald Trump, who counts evangelical Christians among his core supporters, has become a vocal champion of the pastor's case.

The U.S. president believed he and Erdogan had agreed a deal to release him in July as part of a wider agreement, but Ankara has denied this.

BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Former foreign minister Boris Johnson will call on the governing Conservative Party on Tuesday to return to its traditional values of low tax and strong policing, pressing his challenge to British Prime Minister Theresa May.
With just six months before Britain leaves the European Union, May's precarious position at the helm of her party has been further shaken by criticism of her Brexit plans, both at home and in Brussels.
Johnson, who became the figurehead for the campaign to leave the EU, has been one of her loudest critics, describing her plans to keep close ties with the bloc as ""deranged"" and little more than a bid to turn Britain into a vassal state.
May has shown little sign of moving away from her so-called Chequers plan, but after trying to display unity over Brexit at her party's annual conference in the city of Birmingham, her former foreign secretary looks set to shatter those attempts.
In a speech that will do little to temper talk that Johnson, who quit over May's Brexit plan, is launching a bid to replace her, he will urge the party against trying to ""ape"" the policies of the main opposition Labour Party.
""We must on no account follow (Labour leader Jeremy) Corbyn, and start to treat capitalism as a kind of boo word,"" he will say, according to excerpts of his speech.
""We can't lose our faith in competition and choice and markets but we should restate the truth that there is simply no other system that is so miraculously successful in satisfying human wants and needs.""
May's team had hoped the party's annual conference would hand her a platform to revitalize a pledge she made when she became prime minister in 2016 to help those people who are ""just about managing"" and try to steal the initiative from Labour.
But the conference has been dominated by Brexit, with eurosceptic lawmakers attracting hundreds of Conservative members to their events on the fringes. Only handfuls turned out to hear ministers' speeches in the main hall.
BELIEF
Johnson's speech will do little to change that.
There is little doubt that he will renew his attack on May's Brexit plans and call for support for his competing proposal - an enhanced free trade deal based on the one agreed between the EU and Canada.
Steve Baker, a former Brexit minister, offered Johnson some support by again defending the proposal - something May says would create a new border between the British province of Northern Ireland and mainland Britain.
""We believe that we have produced a proposal which can operate within the current framework of technology and administration to deliver a free flowing border with no infrastructure on the island of Ireland within the boundaries of a free trade agreement,"" Baker told BBC radio.
But May again said she was pressing on with her Chequers plan, named after her country residence where she hashed out agreement with her ministers in July, and that she would bring new proposals to unlock stalled Brexit talks.
The split over the EU, which has dogged the Conservative Party for decades, has never been wider.
Johnson, the first Conservative to become mayor of largely left-leaning London, will use his speech to try to get the party faithful onside, with a rallying cry to take the fight to the Labour Party.
He is not universally liked. Several members of the cabinet and in the wider party have criticized him for undermining May at a time when the talks to leave the EU are entering one of their toughest phases. Some have balked at the idea of him becoming party leader.
But his call to re-energize the Conservative brand will strike a chord with some members who fear that Labour has stolen the domestic agenda.

""We should set our taxes to stimulate investment and growth. We should be constantly aiming not to increase but to cut taxes,"" he will say. ""It is the conservative approach that gets things done, so let's follow our conservative instincts.""

PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo ordered more rescuers to be sent in to find victims of a devastating earthquake and tsunami on Tuesday as the official death toll rose above 1,200 and looting raised fears of growing lawlessness.
Most of the dead have been from the small city of Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta, but some remote areas have been cut off since Friday's 7.5 magnitude quake triggered tsunami waves, leading to fears the toll could soar.
""There are some main priorities that we must tackle and the first is to evacuate, find and save victims who've not yet been found,"" Widodo told a government meeting to coordinate disaster recovery efforts on the west coast of Sulawesi island.
He said he had ordered the national search and rescue agency to send more police and soldiers into the affected districts, some cut off by destroyed roads, landslides and downed bridges.
The official death toll surged to 1,234, the national disaster agency said. 
The Red Cross said the situation was ""nightmarish"" and reports from its workers venturing into one cut-off area, Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and close to the epicenter, indicated it had been hit ""extremely hard"".
Four badly hit districts have a combined population of about 1.4 million.
In Palu, tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet) smashed into the beachfront, while hotels and shopping malls collapsed in ruins and some neighborhoods were swallowed up by ground liquefaction.
Among those killed were 34 children at a Christian bible study camp, a Red Cross official said. 
The government has ordered aid supplies to be airlifted in but there's little sign of help on Palu's shattered streets and survivors appeared increasingly desperate.
A Reuters news team saw a shop cleared by about 100 people, shouting, scrambling and fighting each other for items including clothes, toiletries, blankets and water.
Many people grabbed diapers while one man clutched a rice cooker as he headed for the door. Non-essential goods were scattered on the floor amid shards of broken glass.
At least 20 police were at the scene but did not intervene. The government has played down fears of looting saying disaster victims could take essential goods and shops would be compensated later.
Indonesia is all too familiar with earthquakes and tsunamis. A quake in 2004 triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean that killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.
It has said it would accept offers of international aid, having shunned outside help earlier this year when an earthquake struck the island of Lombok.

'BURIED FAST'
Rescuers in Palu held out hope they could still save lives.
""We suspect there are still some survivors trapped inside,"" the head of one rescue team, Agus Haryono, told Reuters at the collapsed seven-storey Hotel Roa Roa.
About 50 people were believed to have been caught inside the hotel when it was brought down. About nine bodies have been recovered from the ruins and three rescued alive.
Haryono pored over the hotel's blueprints, searching for possible pockets and a way through to them. A faint smell of decomposition hung in the air.
Power has yet to be restored and aftershocks have rattled jangled nerves.
A particular horror in several areas in and around Palu was liquefaction, which happens when soil shaken by an earthquake behaves like a liquid.
About 1,700 houses in one neighborhood were swallowed up, with hundreds of people believed buried, the national disaster agency said.
Before-and-after satellite pictures show a largely built-up neighborhood just south of Palu's airport seemingly wiped clean of all signs of life by liquefaction.
Elsewhere, on the outskirts of Palu, trucks brought 54 bodies to a mass grave dug in sandy soil.
Most of the bodies had not been claimed, a policeman said, but some relatives turned up to pay respects to loved ones at the 50-metre (165 ft) trench, where the smell of decomposition was overpowering.
""It's OK if he's buried in the mass grave, it's better to have him buried fast,"" said Rosmawati Binti Yahya, 52, whose husband was among those placed in the grave, before heading off to look for her missing daughter.
More than 65,000 homes were damaged and more than 60,000 people have been displaced and are in need of emergency help, while thousands have been streaming out of stricken areas.
Commercial airlines have struggled to restore operations at Palu's damaged airport but military aircraft have taken some survivors out.
But thousands of people have been thronging the airport hoping for any flight out, and authorities have said a navy vessel capable of taking 1,000 people at a time would be deployed to help with the evacuation. 

Sulawesi is one of the archipelago nation's five main islands.

Budget Minister Gerald Darmanin said half of the new customs officers would be hired by the end of this year, ahead of Britain's expected departure on March 29, 2019. 
""We absolutely have to prepare for the worse, that is to say that in March there is no legal relationship with Great Britain,"" Darmanin told France Bleu Nord radio.
With less than six months to go until Britain leaves the EU there is still no agreement on divorce terms and clarity on a new trade relationship. 
Darmanin said that while the northern port of Dunkirk regularly handled goods from outside the EU, the government was looking for a new customs facility in nearby Calais, which handles mainly trade with Britain.
The fortunes of Calais and the wider Hauts-de-France region are closely intertwined with the UK's future trade ties.
Darmanin also said plans were being made for a new scanner that can scan freight trains passing through the Channel Tunnel linking England and France at 30 km an hour (19 miles and hour).
""The departure of our British friends from the common market will have negative consequences,"" Darmanin said. 
""We have to re-establish the border because otherwise people in the single market will not understand why companies from outside the EU's rules have access to the single market.""
Separately, Darmanin told Les Echos newspaper that merchandise coming from Britain could face up to four separate customs procedures under a post-Brexit regime against only one currently.

That could translate into an extra two minutes per truck going through border controls, which could potentially lead to long queues gridlock in ports, he said.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish prosecutors ordered the detention of 417 suspects in a money-laundering investigation into the transfer of about 2.5 billion lira ($419 million) worth of foreign currency to bank accounts abroad, broadcaster CNN Turk said on Tuesday.
The vast majority of the recipients of the funds were Iranian citizens resident in the United States, it added, citing a statement from Istanbul's chief prosecutor.
Istanbul police teams were launching raids across a series of provinces, searching properties and detaining many people, the broadcaster said.
State-owned Anadolu news agency said 216 of the suspects had so far been detained in operations across 40 provinces.
Police, the prosecutor and other judicial authorities were not immediately available to comment on the report, which was carried by other Turkish media.
The investigation was aimed at those who ""targeted the economic and financial security of the Turkish Republic,"" the Istanbul chief prosecutor's office said, according to CNN Turk.
The issue of foreign money transfers has become politically sensitive in Turkey, which is in the throes of a currency crisis. The lira has fallen about 40 percent against the dollar this year, prompting President Tayyip Erdogan to warn Turks against sending money abroad if it is not for investment. 
""We will not forgive those who resort to smuggling money abroad if it is not to grow, develop and spread their business, trade and investments,"" Erdogan said in a speech to business leaders in April.
There were no indications of any links between the current investigation and Erdogan's push to encourage Turks to keep their money in Turkey.
The suspects were accused of money laundering, ""forming a gang with the aim of committing crime,"" and ""breaking a law aimed at preventing the financing of terrorism,"" the statement said. The operation was launched by financial crimes police.
It said the suspects were accused of receiving commission for sending the money to 28,088 accounts abroad. The transfers were made from various bank branches and ATMs starting from Jan. 1, 2017 with sums of 5,000 lira and more, the statement said.
The crackdown comes months after a U.S. court sentenced an executive from Turkey's state-owned Halkbank to 32 months in jail in an Iran sanctions-busting case. The bank has denied any wrongdoing and Turkey has said that case is politically motivated.

204,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",Myanmar's neighbors urge accountability for Rakhine violence,"By John Geddie
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Southeast Asian foreign ministers have urged Myanmar to give a full mandate to an inquiry commission to hold accountable those responsible for the violence in Rakhine state, Singapore said on Tuesday.
The ministers, who met informally on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly last week, expressed grave concern over the violence, Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan told parliament, calling it a ""man-made humanitarian disaster"".
Over the last year, more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar to neighboring Bangladesh, according to U.N. agencies, following a military response to attacks on security posts by Rohingya insurgents. 
A recent U.N. report accused Myanmar's military of gang rapes and mass killings with ""genocidal intent"" in Rakhine and called for its commander-in-chief and five generals to be prosecuted under international law.
Myanmar has denied most of the allegations in the report, blaming Rohingya ""terrorists"" for most accounts of atrocities.
""We expressed our grave concern with these alleged acts of violence... This is a man-made humanitarian disaster and something which should not be happening in this day and age,"" Balakrishnan said, referring to the meeting of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which includes Myanmar.
""The foreign ministers urged the Myanmar government that...an independent commission of inquiry...should be given a full mandate to investigate and to hold all those responsible fully accountable.""
Singapore chairs ASEAN this year and regional leaders will meet next month in the city-state.
Myanmar's government spokesman, Zaw Htay, did not answer telephone calls on Tuesday. Last month, he said he would no longer speak to the media over the phone but only at a biweekly conference.
In July, Myanmar established a commission of inquiry to probe allegations of human rights abuses in Rakhine, which includes two local and two international members from Japan and the Philippines.
ASEAN, formed more than half a century ago, has historically struggled with challenges facing the region because it works only by consensus and is reluctant to get involved in any matter deemed to be internal to any of its members.
The group's recent statements on Rakhine have focused on the importance of the repatriation of displaced persons to Myanmar and reconciliation among communities. 
But amid the international condemnation, it appears to be taking a firmer stance.
Balakrishnan said that if left to ""fester"", the situation in Rakhine could lead to the spread of terrorism which would threaten ""Southeast Asia and beyond"".
""They (the Myanmar government) do need to do the right thing...for all the vulnerable, defenseless and innocent victims,"" said Balakrishnan.

In a recent interview, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad criticized Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi over her handling of the Rohingya crisis, saying, ""We don't really support her anymore.""

Center-right Chancellor Angela Merkel, hardline Interior Minister Horst Seehofer and Social Democrat Labour Minister Hubertus Heil reached a compromise deal that removes labor market hurdles for all non-EU citizens with job qualifications and German language skills.
The three coalition parties agreed in the outline of their law, seen by Reuters, that companies will be allowed to recruit foreign workers in all professions, regardless of an official list of sectors suffering labor shortages.
The paper also proposes that the government will no longer insist that companies give preference to German citizens in filling vacancies before looking for non-EU foreigners.
In addition, foreign graduates and workers with vocational training will get an opportunity to come to Germany for six months to look for a position if they meet certain job qualifications and German language requirements.
They also have to prove that they have enough financial resources so they will not depend on welfare benefits during their stay in Germany, the parties agreed.
The compromise deal does not include the so-called 'Spurwechsel' (lane change) proposal which would allow refugees living in Germany to shed their asylum seeker status if they find a job and learn German.
Seehofer, whose CSU party fears losing voters to the far-right in a regional election later this month, was against such a provision because he feared it would encourage future immigration by asylum seekers without the right skills.
""We maintain the principle of separation of asylum and labor migration,"" the outline of the immigration law reads.

But the parties said they would define a residence status for well-integrated refugees who cannot be deported and are able to earn their living on their own in order to give employers and migrants more security when planning.

210,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 02:42AM ET</span>","Japan PM Abe keeps allies in key posts, just one woman in cabinet","By Linda Sieg
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe kept key ministers in their posts in a cabinet reshuffle on Tuesday, including finance, trade and foreign affairs, while appointing just one woman to the new lineup.
Abe, who has made female empowerment a high profile policy, tapped Satsuki Katayama, a conservative lawmaker and former finance official, as minister of regional revitalization and gender equality, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said in announcing the cabinet.
Abe, who returned to office in December 2012 after a troubled 2006-2007 term as premier, was re-elected leader of his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) last month, putting him on track to become Japan's longest-serving prime minister.
Abe's reshuffle appeared to focus on stability as he prepares to push ahead with his controversial attempt to revise the post-war, pacifist constitution, political experts said.
His allies Suga and Finance Minister Taro Aso were reappointed.
Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko, Foreign Minister Taro Kono, and Economy Minister Toshimitsu Motegi, who handled difficult trade talks with Washington, also kept their posts.
""He's appointed old friends and reliable allies and kept people in key portfolios to buy stability,"" said Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University's Japan campus.
He said the appointment of just one female minister in a 19-member cabinet ""exposes the empty grandstanding on 'Womenomics'"". The previous cabinet had two female members.
Abe appointed one lawmaker - Justice Minister Takashi Yamashita - from the LDP faction led by former defense minister Shigeru Ishiba, whom he defeated in the LDP leadership race.
Abe chose Takeshi Iwaya, a former parliamentary vice defense minister, to replace Itsunori Onodera as defense minister. Iwaya was known recently for backing the legalization of casinos in Japan.
Close ally Akira Amari, a former economics minister who resigned to take responsibility for a funding scandal in 2016, was appointed LDP executive for election strategy ahead of critical upper house elections next year, party officials said.
Abe has made clear that he wants to forge ahead with his politically divisive plan to amend the constitution's Article 9 to clarify the ambiguous status of its military, known as the Self-Defense Forces (SDF).
But his immediate challenges are to manage fractious trade ties with Washington and keep an economic recovery on track.

Last week, Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to open new talks on a bilateral trade agreement that would see Washington refraining from raising tariffs on Japanese car exports for now, but Trump could revive the threat if progress is slow.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Some of the actions Aung San Suu Kyi has taken as Myanmar's civilian leader are ""regrettable"" but her Nobel Peace Prize will not be withdrawn, the head of the Nobel Foundation told Reuters in an interview in Stockholm on Friday.
Lars Heikensten, speaking days before the awarding of this year’s peace prize, said it made no sense to withdraw awards in reaction to things that happened after they were given, as judges would constantly have to discuss laureates' merits.
U.N. investigators issued a report in August accusing Myanmar's military of carrying out mass killings of Muslim Rohingya with ""genocidal intent"" in an operation that drove more than 700,000 refugees across the border to Bangladesh.
Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for campaigning for democracy and now leads the Myanmar government, was accused in the same report of failing to use her ""moral authority"" to protect civilians.
""We see what she's been doing in Myanmar has been questioned a lot and we stand for human rights, that's one of our core values,"" Lars Heikensten, the head of the Nobel Foundation, said. 
""So of course to the extent that she's responsible for that, that is very regrettable,"" he added.
Government spokesman Zaw Htay did not answer phone calls seeking comment on Monday. He said last month he would no longer speak to the media over the phone, only at a biweekly conference.
Myanmar has rejected the U.N. findings as ""one-sided"". It says the military action, which followed militant attacks on security forces in August last year, was a legitimate counterinsurgency operation. 
Suu Kyi said last month that in hindsight her government could have handled the situation in Rakhine state better, but did not acknowledge any major crimes.
""We don't believe it would make sense to try to withdraw prizes ... it would involve us in constant discussions about the merits about what people are doing afterwards, after they have received the prize,"" Heikensten said.
""There has always been and there always will be Nobel laureates that are doing things after they've been awarded the prize which we do not approve of or which we don't think are the right things. That we cannot avoid I think,"" he added.
The Stockholm-based Nobel Foundation oversees the administration of all the Nobel Prizes, which are awarded by different organizations in Sweden and Norway.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the Peace Prize, said in August that its rules did not allow awards to be withdrawn. 
The laureate of this year's Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday in Oslo.

ANDREAS, Pennsylvania (Reuters) - When Nadia Hassani left Germany after winning a U.S. green card in a lottery 21 years ago, she never dreamed a U.S. president would accuse the program of bringing in terrorists - as Donald Trump did last year.
Now a cook, gardener and writer, Hassani is a passionate advocate for immigration and diversity in her blog Green Card Gardner https://greencardgardener.com and has championed the culture of her native Germany in her cookbook Spoonfuls of Germany.
This year, she will be taking part in a German-funded charm offensive called Wunderbar Together https://wunderbartogether.org along with 300 other people and groups to help restore Germany's image in the United States and strengthen ties after criticism of the country by Trump.
""The anti-immigration atmosphere undermines the whole reason I came to America. It's contrary to what America is all about,"" said Hassani, who found acceptance in the United States that had been elusive in Germany because of her German-Tunisian heritage.
Trump has been at odds with Chancellor Angela Merkel since his election victory in 2016 over issues such as trade, Iran and military spending. He singled out Germany for criticism again during a speech at the U.N. general assembly last week.
Germany has mounted similar campaigns before in countries such as China, Mexico and India but those involved with The Year of German-American Friendship (Deutschlandjahr USA) say it is the most ambitious so far.
To reach communities beyond the East and West coasts that have typically dominated Berlin's U.S. outreach efforts, the initiative includes more than 1,000 projects.
From pop-up exhibits on the future of work to a cultural WanderbUS that will criss-cross the country to a celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Bauhaus architectural movement, the campaign is meant to shine a positive light on Germany and its culture at time of deep strains between the long-time allies.
""We view the Deutschlandjahr as a laboratory to see where we need to get more engaged, and where we have to do a better job explaining, or perhaps resist more, or perhaps just be stronger,"" Emily Haber, Germany's ambassador to the United States, told reporters in Berlin in August.
'SPECIAL BOND'
Hassani's concerns about Trump's isolationist polices are shared by many Germans, including Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who has been critical of the U.S. president.
Maas, who wants to rebalance the transatlantic relationship by strengthening the European Union and partnering with other allies, will kick off the campaign in Washington on Oct. 3, the 28th anniversary of German reunification.
""We want to preserve this special bond. To do that we must politically cast a realistic look at the German-American relationship,"" Maas said. ""If we give Germans and Americans the possibility to be inspired by each other anew, that can help point us as politicians to a new partnership.""
Despite their political differences, the countries remain closely linked economically. The United States imports $129 billion of German goods a year, while German firms employ 700,000 people in the United States, making them the fourth largest foreign employer.
Some 45 million Americans claim some German heritage - and a third of the 3.4 million Germans living overseas in 2015 were in the United States. More than 10,000 U.S. students study at German universities each year, and the number is growing.
Germany and its European partners also depend on the United States for security under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) - a point that has prompted Trump to push Europe to boost military spending.
But many German language programs are struggling to survive in the United States and the U.S. military has reduced its presence in Germany since the end of the Cold War.
""Even if the transatlantic community remains the cornerstone of German foreign policy, we cannot view the relationship as self-evident, nor as completely lost,"" wrote Syreta Haggray for the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung http://www.kas.de/wf/en think-tank. 
Re:publica https://re-publica.com/en, the annual technology and social media conference in Berlin, will hold five events in the U.S. cities of New York, Los Angeles, Austin, Portland and Detroit.

""There's no question that the political climate is difficult. We want to look together at what the future holds, and bring back new ideas,"" said Solveig Rietschel, head of international programs for re:publica.

213,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2018 02:11AM ET</span>",China mounts publicity campaign to counter criticism on Xinjiang,"By Ben Blanchard and Tom Miles
BEIJING/GENEVA (Reuters) - China is mounting an increasingly sophisticated counterattack to criticism of its policies in the restive, heavily Muslim region of Xinjiang, courting foreign media and running opinion pieces abroad as it seeks to spin a more positive message.
Beijing has faced an outcry from activists, scholars, foreign governments and U.N. rights experts over mass detentions and strict surveillance of the mostly Muslim Uighur minority and other Muslim groups who call Xinjiang home.
The United States is even looking at sanctions on senior Chinese officials and companies linked to allegations of human rights abuses there, which would further ratchet up tension amid their blistering trade war.
China says Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists and has rejected all accusations of mistreatment in an area where hundreds have been killed in recent years in unrest between Uighurs and members of the ethnic Han Chinese majority.
Officials say they are putting some people through ""vocational"" style courses to rein in extremism, and have denounced hostile foreign forces for sowing misinformation.
In an opinion piece last week in the Jakarta Post entitled ""Xinjiang, what a wonderful place,"" China's ambassador to Indonesia, Xiao Qian, wrote that religious rights were respected and protected there and attacks were ""anti-religion in nature"".
He added, ""But regrettably, a few institutions and people from the West pursue double standards, deliberately distorting the facts, speculating on the so-called 're-education camps' and misrepresenting (the) Chinese government's efforts to prevent religious extremism and promote deradicalisation.""
China's ambassador to Britain, Liu Xiaoming, has also written to the Financial Times and the Economist to defend its policy on Xinjiang.
Privately, however, China has not been so willing to discuss Xinjiang with foreign diplomats, say two diplomats who have attended meetings with Chinese officials.
""They just shut you down,"" said one of the diplomats.
PUTTING ITS SIDE
Last month, the Chinese government invited a small group of foreign reporters to a briefing on the sidelines of a U.N. human rights meeting in Geneva, to put its side of the story in unusually strong and outspoken terms.
Li Xiaojun, publicity director at the Bureau of Human Rights Affairs of the State Council Information Office, which is the office of the Chinese cabinet's spokesman, denied mistreating Muslims in Xinjiang, and said China was trying to avoid the problems of radicalization Europe had experienced.
""Look at Belgium, look at Paris, look at some other European countries,"" Li said, referring to recent terror attacks in these locations blamed on Islamic extremists. ""You have failed.""
Government officials at the Geneva event were accompanied by five Chinese academic experts, who all remained silent when asked if they had any criticism of China's human rights record.
The five said they had not been to Xinjiang recently. 
Asked how they knew about conditions there, Wang Xiaolin, a professor at Shanghai's Fudan University, said there were a lot of information channels, such as television broadcasts, social media, and information shared by business people, tourists and academics and friends who traveled there.
It is hard to quantify whether anyone is paying attention to what China has been saying on Xinjiang. Ambassador Xiao's piece for the Jakarta Post was roasted by followers of the paper's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter pages as Chinese ""propaganda"".
Asked about China's efforts to put its side of the story and whether its messaging had been effective, the Foreign Ministry said the region was stable and prosperous, with no attacks for more than a year.
""On Xinjiang matters, the Chinese people have the most right to speak,"" it said in a short statement sent to Reuters.
Foreign human rights groups and exiles have been unimpressed with China's defense, and held their own panel in Geneva.
""What we are seeing now in East Turkestan is more than just repression: it is an intentional campaign of assimilation by the Chinese government targeting the Uighur identity,"" said Dolkun Isa, president of the exiled World Uyghur Congress, using the term the community employs to refer to Xinjiang.
China has sought to cast its security crackdown in resource-rich Xinjiang - strategically located on the borders of Afghanistan, central Asia, India and Pakistan - as part of the wider global ""war on terror"".
All countries have a responsibility to protect their security and that of their citizens, Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng told the Financial Times in an interview published last week, whose transcript was released by the foreign ministry. 
""The Chinese government will not permit Xinjiang to become a second Syria, Libya or Iraq,"" said Le, an increasingly influential voice in China's diplomacy, whom diplomatic sources in Beijing say is tipped as a possible future foreign minister.

""If upheaval in Xinjiang spreads outside the borders, it will affect the stability of central Asia and the Middle East, and maybe spread to Europe.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Production and trafficking of illicit drugs have reached unprecedented levels in Southeast Asia's Mekong region and East Asia, the United Nations said on Tuesday, warning that oversupply increases the risks for younger users.
Even as authorities seize larger amounts of illicit drugs, oversupply pushes down prices, bringing some, such as methamphetamine, within reach, an official of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said.
""The supply keeps growing as organized crime is ramping up supply and flooding the region with product,"" Jeremy Douglas, the body's regional representative, told Reuters ahead of a meeting in the Thai capital to assess the trends.
In Thailand, for instance, the price of a methamphetamine tablet ranged between $1.5 and $4.5 in 2017, down from a range of $4 to $7 in 2014, UN data this year showed.
In the wealthy nearby city-state of Singapore, prices fell to below $6 in 2017, from $20 in 2014.
""The surge in 'yaba' tablet supply has pushed street prices down across the region, making them affordable by younger users who are being introduced to the drug,"" Douglas added, using a Thai term for the tablet form of methamphetamine. 
Police seized more than 14 million meth pills worth $45 million in one of Thailand's biggest drug busts in August. 
Neighboring Malaysia made its largest seizure of crystal meth in May, intercepting nearly 1.2 tonnes of the drug disguised as tea in a shipment from Myanmar.

Much of Southeast Asia's meth production comes from lawless parts of Myanmar, in particular Shan State, the UNODC said in 2017.

Chamorro, 88, was taken to a hospital in the capital Managua and was in a ""delicate"" state, her family said in a statement. 
Chamorro was the first woman elected as a head of state in the Americas after she unseated Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega as Nicaraguan president in 1990. She ruled until early 1997.
The wife of a popular opposition newspaper editor during Anastasio Somoza's dictatorship, Chamorro took over the daily La Prensa after her husband's assassination and later directed its criticism of the socialist Sandinistas.
She is best remembered for ending the rule of Ortega, a Cold War nemesis of the United States who defied the U.S.-backed rightwing Contras that tried to overthrow the Sandinista government that ousted Somoza.

Ortega reclaimed the presidency in 2006 and is currently facing calls for his resignation after cracking down on protests over proposed social security cuts.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - The center-right Coalition Avenir Quebec is on track to win power for the first time in Canada's Quebec province on Monday, dealing a blow to the Liberal incumbents and allowing the party to make good on its promises to curb immigration. 
The business-friendly CAQ is expected to win a majority of seats in Canada's second most populous province, according to early results from Elections Quebec and network projections.
""My team and I are very eager to get to work for you,"" Legault said Monday night on Twitter.
The CAQ win would follow a shift to the right in Ontario, where Premier Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservative government swept to power in June, ending 15 years of Liberal rule in Canada’s most populous province.
Quebec's Liberals held power for 13 out of the last 15 years.
Legault campaigned on a controversial plan to take in 10,000 fewer immigrants a year and to expel new residents who fail tests on French and Quebec values within three years.
""Quebecers have clearly indicated their desire for change,"" Liberal leader and former Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard said in a concession speech, adding that he would reflect on his political future.
Elections Quebec said the CAQ was ahead in 73 out of the 125 seats in the province’s legislature, with the Liberals in second place with 32 seats.
The election in the mostly French-speaking province, home to the majority of Canada’s influential dairy farmers, came as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government decided to open up the country’s dairy industry to the United States, as part of concessions made to strike a last-minute deal for a renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement.
Trudeau congratulated Legault in a statement for the winning CAQ majority. His Liberals, which are betting on gains in Quebec to offset expected losses elsewhere in a 2019 federal election, could find themselves clashing with the CAQ on changes to the protectionist dairy system. 
Legault had called the deal ""disappointing"" earlier on Monday and said he would look at ""all options"" to defend the province's farmers.
Trade and the question of how many outsiders should be let into the province had eclipsed arguments over separatism that have dominated politics in Quebec in recent decades. Early results show the separatist Parti Quebecois running virtually neck and neck with the left-leaning Quebec Solidaire to achieve the 12 seats needed to obtain official party status. 

CAQ is not expected to make any major economic changes from the Liberals which paid down debt and reported successive balanced budgets, boosting the economy, said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.

Beijing and Washington are locked in a trade war in which they have imposed increasingly severe rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the destroyer the USS Decatur traveled within 12 nautical miles of Gaven and Johnson Reefs in the Spratly Islands on Sunday.
The operation was the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing's efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters, where Chinese, Japanese and some Southeast Asian navies operate.
China's Defence Ministry said a Chinese naval ship had been sent to warn the U.S. vessel to leave.
The ministry said China has irrefutable sovereignty over the South China Sea islands and the waters around them, and the situation there is progressing well thanks to the hard work of China and countries in Southeast Asia.
""The U.S. side repeatedly sends military ships without permission into seas close to South China Seas islands, seriously threatening China's sovereignty and security, seriously damaging Sino-U.S. military ties and seriously harming regional peace and stability,"" the ministry said.
""China's military is resolutely opposed to this,"" it said.
The Chinese armed forces will continue to take all necessary steps to protect the country's sovereignty and security, the ministry said.
China's Foreign Ministry said in a separate statement it strongly urged the United States to stop such ""provocative"" actions and to ""immediately correct its mistakes"".
The operation also comes as military ties between the two countries have dived, with China also angered by U.S. sanctions on China's military for buying Russian arms and by U.S. support for self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Monday he did not see relations between the United States and China worsening, a day after his trip to China was canceled.
Reuters reported on Sunday that China canceled a security meeting with Mattis that had been planned for October. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Mattis was no longer going to China.
China has not yet commented on the matter.

Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe is due to visit the United States later this year but China's Defence Ministry suggested last week that may not happen.

In a joint statement with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in their Pyongyang summit last month, North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un expressed a willingness to “permanently dismantle” the Yongbyon nuclear complex if the United States takes corresponding action.
Moon said this would include a declaration of an official end to the war. 
In a commentary, KCNA said on Tuesday that declaring the war's end should have ""been resolved half a century ago,"" and called it ""the most basic and primary process for the establishment of new DPRK-U.S. relations and peace"" on the Korean peninsula ""to which the U.S. was also committed,"" , referring to North Korea by its official name, Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
At their unprecedented summit in June, U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim agreed in broad terms to ""build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula."" 
However, Washington wants North Korea to first provide a complete inventory of its weapons programs and take irreversible steps to give up its arsenal.
KCNA said the Yongbyon nuclear facility, which the North expressed a willingness to take offline if the United States takes corresponding action, ""is a core one for its nuclear program."" 
""The DPRK is taking substantial and crucial steps to implement the joint statement made at the DPRK-U.S. summit, but the U.S. is still trying to subdue someone by resorting to sanctions,"" the unnamed commentary accused. 
However, three senior U.S. officials involved in North Korea policy previously told Reuters that no progress has been made in moving toward serious negotiations on eliminating or even halting Kim’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.

Dismantling Yongbyon would slow the production of fissile material, but not reduce the current stockpile of plutonium and highly enriched uranium, nor clear suspicions of other secret production sites, an expert previously told Reuters.

Bolsonaro, who is recovering from a near-fatal stabbing, has increased his lead ahead of the election this Sunday with 31 percent of voter support in a simulated first-round ballot, the survey by polling firm Ibope said. Haddad has 21 percent.
In the likely case of a runoff vote on Oct. 28, required if no candidate takes a majority, Bolsonaro and Haddad both had 42 percent, with the remaining voters undecided or saying they would annul their ballots.
Haddad surged after he replaced jailed former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on the Workers Party ticket, who was banned last month by an electoral court from running from prison, but his support remained stagnant compared to the same Ibope poll last week.
Bolsonaro gained on Haddad in the runoff scenario. Last week Haddad had 42 percent against Bolsonaro's 38 percent. 
Ibope said support for center-left candidate Ciro Gomes remained stable at 11 percent, while business-friendly former Sao Paulo governor Geraldo Alckmin dropped to 8 percent. 

The poll, published by the Estado de S.Paulo newspaper and TV Globo, surveyed 3,010 voters across Brazil on Sept. 29 and 30. It has a margin of error of two percentage points.

Britain is due to leave the European Union in March next year, but May has said that talks with the European Union are at an impasse insisting that ""no deal"" is better than a bad deal.
But Sturgeon said that even if May achieved her ""Chequers"" plan for Brexit, the policy of taking Britain out of the single market would hurt the economy.
""The prime minister's current position – that we must leave the single market regardless of the consequences – is an act of wilful economic vandalism,"" Sturgeon will tell the Europa Institute in Edinburgh. 
Scots voted to stay in the European Union in 2016 by a large margin, but Britain as a whole voted to leave. The Brexit process has since put Scotland's devolved nationalist government increasingly at loggerheads with the UK's Conservative leadership. 
Most polls show public support for Scottish independence from the UK stuck at the same 45 percent level it has been since a 2014 vote, although a recent poll showed backing for a split has ticked up in a sign of discontent over Brexit.
Sturgeon said that May was now facing a ""mutiny"" from her Conservative Party at its annual conference in Birmingham this week, adding that May should ask for more time to negotiate withdrawal from the bloc.
And a disastrous few weeks for the prime minister, in which her blueprint for Brexit was rejected at an EU summit, contained a glimmer of hope, the Scottish leader said.

""The very fact that the prime minister's negotiating position has been exposed as untenable, means that membership of the single market and the customs union must now be a stronger political possibility than at any time in the last two years,"" Sturgeon will tell the Edinburgh audience.

Anti-corruption judge Sergio Moro unsealed the plea-bargain testimony of jailed former Finance Minister Antonio Palocci stating that PT founder and then-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva ordered the collection of bribe money in 2010 to fund the campaign of his successor Dilma Rousseff.
Lawyers for Lula, who was jailed in April and barred from running for office due to a corruption conviction, said publication of the testimony was politically motivated to harm Lula and his party.
Brazilians will vote on Sunday in the most polarized election in a generation and the Workers Party could return to office despite corruption cases against its leaders and allies. The Palocci testimony could increase anti-Workers Party sentiment, which has helped make Bolsonaro the frontrunner in the race.
Haddad has surged in voter support to six points behind Bolsonaro since he was confirmed as Lula's replacement, according to opinion polls. The polls indicate the Workers Party candidate could win a likely second round runoff vote on Oct. 28.
Palocci resigned as Rousseff's chief of staff in 2011 after only five months due a corruption accusation. In the testimony make public on Monday, he said he attended a meeting in 2010 where Lula ordered the then chief executive of state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, José Sérgio Gabrielli, to commission 40 drill ships and use bribe money from the contracts to fund Rousseff's campaign.
Palocci was arrested two years ago in the sweeping Car Wash investigation into the use of the contracts at Petrobras, as the state oil company is known, by the Workers Party and allied parties to siphon off funds for their political needs.
The court documents made public on Monday also cite alleged corrupt practices by Petrobras executives and one financial institution related to exploration blocks in Africa, where the company partnered with investment bank Banco BTG Pactual SA in a venture known as PetroAfrica. 
BTG acquired a stake in the venture in 2013 and was trying to sell it until recently.
BTG's most widely traded class of stock fell 3.4 percent on Monday, to 20.57 reais, after excerpts of Palocci's plea deal were released. 

The bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Gabrielli could not be immediately reached for comment.

Concerns over the levels of immigration were a key driver behind the 2016 vote to leave the European Union and May has pledged to end freedom of movement from the EU. 
""It will be a skills-based system where it is workers’ skills that matter, not where they come from. It will be a system that looks across the globe and attracts the people with the skills we need,"" May said in a statement.
May said the system would ""make sure low skilled immigration is brought down and set the UK on the path to reduce immigration to sustainable levels"".
The government will publish a policy paper this autumn setting out how the new immigration system will work before publishing immigration legislation next year. 

Those wanting to live and work in Britain long term will need to meet minimum salary thresholds and ensure they are not competing for jobs that could otherwise be recruited in the country, May's Conservatives said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The image of the United States has deteriorated further among its traditional allies after a year in which President Donald Trump ratcheted up his verbal attacks on countries like Canada and Germany, a leading survey showed.
The survey of 25 nations by the Pew Research Center also showed that respondents from across the globe have less confidence in Trump's ability to lead than they do in Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping.
Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has pulled the United States out of international agreements like the Paris climate accord and Iran nuclear deal, cozied up to authoritarian leaders like Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un, and criticized his neighbors and NATO allies.
In June, after a G7 summit in Canada, Trump refused to sign a joint statement with America's allies, deriding his host, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, as ""very dishonest and weak"". He has repeatedly attacked Germany for its trade surplus, low defense spending and reliance on Russian gas.
Last week, when giving a speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Trump drew laughter from world leaders when he claimed to have achieved more in his two years in the White House than almost any other U.S. administration in history. 
The survey showed that America's image, which took a big hit in 2017, Trump's first year in office, continued to deteriorate in many countries in 2018, particularly in Europe.
Just 30 percent of Germans have a favorable view of the United States, down five points from last year and the lowest score in the entire survey after Russia, on 26 percent.
Only 38 percent of French and 39 percent of Canadians said they had a positive view of the United States, both down from last year. Mexico inched up slightly to 32 percent.
FAITH IN MERKEL HIGHEST
The countries with the most positive views of the United States were Israel, the Philippines and South Korea, all at 80 percent or above. Across all countries, the U.S. got positive marks, with 50 percent saying they had a positive view, compared to 43 percent who were negative.
Just 7 percent of Spanish, 9 percent of French and 10 percent of Germans said they had confidence in Trump's leadership. In 20 of the 25 countries surveyed, a majority said they had no confidence in Trump.
Across all countries, an average of 27 percent of respondents said they had confidence in Trump. That compared unfavorably to Putin, on 30 percent, and Xi, on 34 percent.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel was the only leader in which a majority of those surveyed, 52 percent, expressed confidence. French President Emmanuel Macron was just behind at 46 percent.
Despite Trump's low ratings, 63 percent of respondents said the world was better off with the United States as the leading power, compared to 19 percent who preferred China in that role.
Allies took a dim view of the Trump administration's position on civil liberties, with majorities in Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Australia and Mexico saying the government did not respect the personal freedoms of its people.
Reflecting Trump's ""America First"" stance, substantial majorities in 19 of the 25 countries surveyed said the United States did not take their interests into account when making international policy. 

The survey was conducted between May and August, and based on interviews with over 900 people in each of the surveyed countries.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Riot police charged in to break up a demonstration in front of Catalonia's regional parliament on Monday, after thousands marched in Barcelona to mark the first anniversary of an ill-fated independence referendum to split from Spain.
The Catalan police used batons to control protesters after some waving yellow, red and blue separatist flags and chanting 'October 1, no forgiving, no forgetting' surrounded the regional parliament and displayed posters reading ""Republic under construction"".
During the day there were short-lived attempts to block roads and train tracks in the Spanish northeastern region, and around 180,000 people marched in Barcelona, hanging ballot boxes and chanting the regional anthem.
Madrid imposed direct rule on Catalonia after it declared independence following the referendum. Elections later returned a regional government favoring a split with Spain through a party supporting union won most votes.
Polls in Catalonia show a relatively even split between those who favor remaining in Spain and those wanting to secede. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has said he favors dialogue on the region's future but has ruled out any moves toward independence.
Pau Benito, a 22-year-old medical student attending the protest with friends, said he supports leaving Spain but thinks the independence movement must be careful not to alienate other Catalans.
""Half of Catalonia doesn't support independence. In the same way we are asking for better treatment from Spain we also need to respect those who don't agree with us,"" he said.
Elsewhere in the region, hundreds of protesters attempted during the morning to block train tracks and roads, with some laying tires across a motorway, but they were quickly dispersed.
Events passed off with little drama in Sant Julia de Ramis, a village where violent clashes broke out a year ago between riot police and those attempting to vote.
People queued there on Monday to re-enact the ballot, which Madrid banned as anti-constitutional, while regional leaders gave speeches. ""The first of October will be the seed of the republic,"" said regional parliament speaker Roger Torrent.

On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with police, as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the anniversary of the polarizing vote.

227,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 05:30PM ET</span>",Chile's Catholic Church criticized over guidelines regarding sexual abuse,"By Natalia A. Ramos Miranda
(Reuters) - Chile's Roman Catholic Church was criticized by victims' groups on Monday as having ""poor judgment"" and being arrogant after it apologized for a manual published on the website of Santiago's archbishop instructing priests and other Church workers not to ""touch the genitals of"" or ""sleep with"" children.
The document, posted last Thursday, provided guidelines for the interaction of church staff with the lay community and was signed by Santiago Archbishop Ricardo Ezzati, who is under investigation for allegedly covering-up abuse.
It was to be discussed with Chilean congregations before being approved as official guidelines, but the document was removed from the website on Friday after media reports and social media criticism of the necessity for such basic guidelines. 
Juan Carlos Cruz, who was sexually abused by a priest as a boy and traveled to the Vatican this year to meet with Pope Francis, said it was ""outrageous"" that it should be necessary to explain to anyone that touching children's genitals was wrong. 
""To publish this without anyone raising alarm shows their arrogance and lack of attention to what they're doing,"" he said. ""It's a reflection of their attitude."" 
Marcial Sanchez, a Chilean Church historian who has campaigned for the Church to pay closer attention to accusations of abuse, said the Church's apologies over such accusations and how it handles them were beginning to ring hollow. 
""This shows there are still people in the senior leadership of the church who lack judgment and don't understand the depth of this crisis,"" Sanchez said. 
The Church in Chile and elsewhere is facing widespread accusations of sexual misconduct by priests and non-clergy employees and cover-ups by Church leaders, and investigations of such claims in multiple jurisdictions. 
The document labeled as ""inappropriate"" actions that a child ""might not accept, or might reject"" such as ""too tight hugs, or touching bottoms or the genital area."" 
It cautioned against ""lying or sleeping with, giving massages to or kissing children, adolescents or vulnerable people on the mouth."" 
Santiago's auxiliary archbishop Cristián Roncagliolo said in a statement posted on the Church's website on Sunday, ""We have asked for forgiveness,"" and suggested that some aspects taken from Church documents in other countries had been translated ""too literally."" 

""There are mistakes in the text, perhaps caused by our adopting guidelines from other cultures,"" he said, adding that the document would be revised ""to reflect in our own words that a crime is a crime.""

229,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Euro zone worried Italy's deficit-boosting budget plan could revive crisis,"By Francesco Guarascio and Jan Strupczewski
LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Top euro zone officials warned Italy on Monday its plan to borrow billions of extra euros to fund spending pledges could tip the bloc back into crisis, vowing to pressure Rome to change course. 
Italy new eurosceptic government proposed on Thursday a budget that increases the deficit to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2019, tripling it in comparison with the plans of its predecessors. 
Markets reacted by dumping Italian debt, the second highest in the euro zone as a share of economic output after bailed-out Greece, as concerns spread about a renewed sovereign debt crisis, just three years after the Greek troubles nearly destroyed the single currency.
In a speech in Germany, European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker said that with its draft, Italy was moving away from the budgetary targets agreed at EU level and warned that if others were to get Italy's treatment, it could spell the end of the euro.
""I would not wish that, after having really been able to cope with the Greek crisis, we'll end up in the same crisis in Italy,"" Juncker said.
Reacting to Juncker's remarks, the Italian Finance Minister Giovanni Tria said later on Monday that he did not expect the end of the euro. 
Italy's government wants higher public spending to finance campaign promises made by its ruling parties - the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and right-wing League - to lower the retirement age, cut taxes, invest in infrastructure and boost welfare.
The country has already benefited from lenient fiscal treatment from the Commission for years, using various options to achieve higher spending.
TRIA QUESTIONED
In a sign of concern over Italy, Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra and French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire asked Tria to explain the draft at a meeting of euro zone finance ministers in Luxembourg, even though it was not on the agenda.
""Recent announcements by the Italian government have raised concerns over its budgetary course, concerns that need to be addressed soon,"" the chairman of euro zone finance ministers Mario Centeno told a news conference after the meeting.
""We are all bound by the euro and we need sound policies to protect it. It is up to the Italian government to show it has a sustainable and credible budgetary plan,"" Centeno said.
Officials said Tria opened the door to changes by telling the ministers that details of the draft were not final yet. He also assured them that Italy's debt would be on a downward path.
However, when he left the meeting Tria declined to answer reporters' questions about the possibility of changing Italy's deficit targets and stressed other EU countries had in the past breached EU fiscal rules. 
Under EU law Italy should reduce its public debt rather than increase borrowing. Rome's total debt is worth 133 percent of GDP. 
Italy has to formally submit its draft 2019 budget to the Commission for scrutiny by Oct 15. The Commission would have up to a week to announce if it has found the budget in clear breach of EU rules, and another week after that to demand a new draft.
Such a rejection has never taken place since the Commission was granted the power to vet draft budgets in 2013. 
SOFT PRESSURE
""We will try to convince the Italian authorities to revert to the medium-term objective which is the EU fiscal rule,"" EU Economic Commissioner Pierre Moscovici told the news conference.
EU rules require governments to seek a budget in balance or in surplus in structural terms, which exclude one off revenues and expenditures and the effects of the business cycle.
Moscovici added that at this stage was not possible to say whether Italian plans for a 2.4 percent headline deficit in 2019 would allow for a reduction of the country's huge public debt.
The EU executive has dealt in previous years with budgets breaking EU rules from France, Spain, Portugal and Italy itself. It has always opted to enter some form of negotiation with the government concerned, branding the draft as ""at risk of non-compliance"" or ""at serious risk of non-compliance"". 
But officials indicated it might be different now. 
""Never were rules broken so bluntly, without the slightest grain of elegance,"" one senior official said.
Moscovici said that while rules had to be respected, he was keen to maintain dialogue with Rome -- code for negotiations over the next two weeks, before Italy submits the final version of the budget, that could save face for both sides.
Le Maire said Italy's euro zone peers would be gradually applying pressure on Rome.

""I think we have to go step by step,"" he said, adding respect for EU rules was key when the EU was facing a serious threat from rising ""populist and nationalist movements"".

230,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",Conservatives would block another Scottish independence vote: Davidson,"EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Britain's Conservative party will commit in its next manifesto to blocking another referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has said.
The comment has raised hackles amongst nationalists north of the English border, where they have a majority in the devolved parliament and are increasingly discontented over Brexit. Historically, such gestures have been perceived as distant London telling Scotland what to do.
Davidson said she would go into Britain's next national election with a manifesto commitment to block a Scottish independence referendum. She argued that in a 2014 independence vote ""the people of Scotland were promised this would be a once in a generation event,"" she told the BBC. 
""Nobody would expect anything different from the Scottish Conservative Party than to say we won't have one.""
In 2014, Scots rejected independence 55 to 45 percent.
Davidson's opponents say, however, that since that time circumstances have changed significantly; Britain overall has voted to leave the EU but one of its nations, Scotland, opted by a large majority to stay in. 
Nevertheless Scotland will leave with the rest of the United Kingdom. Talks between London and Edinburgh over the implications of leaving the EU have been increasingly fraught.
Davidson, who has revived Conservative fortunes in Scotland after decades in the doldrums, equated holding a second independence vote with holding another Brexit vote, an alternative with growing public support but still rejected by May's party.
Davidson told her party conference in Birmingham on Monday that she had voted to stay in the EU in the 2016 Brexit vote but would not ""demand a re-run just because I wasn't on the winning side"".
She warned her party, led by Prime Minister Theresa May who is struggling to deliver Brexit, that there are ""those who are working day by day to break up (the United Kingdom) – and who believe that a chaotic Brexit will help"".
In a statement, the Scottish National Party (SNP), which runs the devolved Scottish government, accused Davidson of ""unbelievable arrogance"".

""The SNP believes that it should be up to the people of Scotland – not Ruth Davidson or Theresa May – to determine their own future,"" said SNP deputy leader Keith Brown.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Monday it was working hard to correct mistaken targeting by its military coalition in Yemen that has killed civilians including children, but U.N. rights experts voiced scepticism.
International pressure mounted on the kingdom, including from allies, to do more to limit civilian casualties in a 3-1/2 year civil war that has killed more than 10,000 people and pushed the already impoverished country to the brink of famine.
Saudi Arabia leads a coalition of Arab states fighting against the Houthi movement that controls Yemen's capital.
The U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child on Monday examined the Saudi record on compliance with a treaty protocol on children in armed conflict, and repeatedly raised the issue of children killed by coalition attacks in Yemen.
""This has been going on a number of years. But still there is no information that any perpetrators or people responsible for these kinds of actions have been prosecuted or sanctioned or dealt with in any way,"" said panel vice-chair Clarence Nelson.
Osaiker Alotaibi of the Saudi defense ministry told the panel of 18 independent experts that the Saudi-led alliance was committed to upholding international humanitarian law. The coalition had a list of 64,000 potential targets in Yemen that were off limits to attack, including schools and hospitals.
Coalition investigations had uncovered ""the existence of certain unintentional mistakes in a number of these operations,"" Alotaibi said. ""The task force recommended that perpetrators should be held to account and victims should enjoy redress.""
Renate Winter, panel chairwoman, asked why schools and hospitals had been repeatedly struck: ""You say it's an accident. How many such accidents can you bear and how many such accidents can people in the country (Yemen) bear?""
Winter then referred to an air strike on a school bus in August in Saada province in north Yemen that killed dozens. 
The Saudi-led coalition said on Sept 1 that it accepted that the air attack had killed dozens of people, including children on a bus, and that it was unjustified. It pledged to hold accountable anyone who contributed to the error.
The convoy in Saada had ""carried some Houthi military staff"", said Bandar Alaiban, president of the Saudi Human Rights Commission who led a government delegation. ""However the air strike was not conducted in line with the rule of engagement because that convoy did not represent a risk to the coalition.""
He blamed the Houthis for putting civilians including children in danger by using schools and hospitals as ""refuges"".

Local media, including Arabic-language newspaper Okaz, reported on Monday that the accusations include membership of the banned Muslim Brotherhood as well as communicating with neighboring Qatar and inciting protests inside Saudi Arabia.
The reports did not name the suspect, but a personal friend, London-based Saudi rights group ALQST, and a network of activists dedicated to monitoring and documenting people they describe as ""prisoners of conscience"" confirmed his identity.
""They meant Essam al-Zamil,"" ALQST's Yahya al-Assiri told Reuters.
A Saudi government media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Zamil has been detained since Sept. 2017 along with dozens of intellectuals and clerics in a crackdown on potential opponents of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whose ambitious economic reform program centered on selling up to five percent of the state-owned Aramco oil company.
In a series of social media posts before his arrest, Zamil said the $2 trillion valuation for Aramco suggested by Prince Mohammed would require the authorities to include the company's oil reserves in the sale.
Reuters reported in August that the government had called off the IPO plans and disbanded financial advisers working on what had been billed as the biggest stock flotation in history.
Efforts to wean the world's top oil exporter off crude and open up Saudis' cloistered lifestyles have been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent. The authorities also arrested scores of top businessmen and officials last November in an anti-corruption campaign, though most of them were later released after reaching financial settlements.
All public protests are banned in Saudi Arabia, as are political parties. Labor unions are illegal, the media are controlled and criticism of the royal family can lead to prison.
The charges against Zamil, according to Okaz, include giving foreign diplomats ""information and analysis about the kingdom"" without informing the authorities or obtaining permission from them.
The report did not provide details, but that accusation echoes state media's labeling of women's rights activists arrested in May as traitors and ""agents of embassies"", which unnerved diplomats in Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally.
The charge of communicating with ""an element of the Qatari regime"" comes amid a 15-month boycott of that country by Saudi Arabia and its allies over alleged ties to terrorism, which Doha denies.

SULAIMANIYA, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraq's parliament postponed a vote on Monday to name a president because the main Kurdish parties, who were supposed to present a candidate, could not overcome differences, said several lawmakers.
Iraq's presidency, traditionally occupied by a Kurd, is largely a ceremonial position but the vote is a key step toward the formation of a new government, which politicians have failed to do since an inconclusive national election in May.
Parliament speaker Mohammed al-Halbousi said the vote would by delayed until Tuesday due to a lack of quorum.
Under Iraq's constitution, the new president would have 15 days to task the largest parliamentary bloc's nominee with forming a government. The prime minister-designate would have 30 days to form a cabinet and present it to parliament for approval.
Lawmakers said the dominant Kurdish parties -- the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) -- were unable to iron out differences and agree on a candidate.
The two sides competed in a parliamentary election in their semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq on Sunday. Allegations of fraud have created tensions. Results have not been announced.
Lawmakers from the parties suggested neither side was showing flexibility. 
Rebwar Taha, a PUK member of the parliament in Baghdad, said the party insists on its candidate, veteran politician Barham Salih. ""Delaying the session until Tuesday will not change our decision,"" he said.
KDP lawmaker Sherwan al-Dobardani said his party was entitled to the position because it has more seats in the national parliament. 
Since Saddam Hussein was toppled in a 2003 U.S.-led invasion, power has been shared among Iraq’s three largest ethnic-sectarian components. The prime minister has traditionally been a Shi’ite Arab, the speaker of parliament a Sunni Arab and the president a Kurd.

PARIS (Reuters) - The United States and Turkey have started training together to carry out joint patrols soon in northern Syria's Manbij area, U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said on Monday, despite tense relations between the two countries.
As agreed by the two NATO allies in June, Turkish and U.S. forces are currently carrying out patrols in Manbij, but those are independent of each other. Training is the last step before the two countries carry out joint patrols.
Last month, Ankara said joint patrols and training for those would begin soon.
""The training now is under way and we'll just have to see how that goes,"" Mattis told a small group of reporters traveling with him to Paris. 
""We have every reason to believe the joint patrols will be coming on time, when the training syllabus is complete so that we do it right,"" Mattis added.
He said the United States was currently working with trainers and it would be followed by a few weeks of training with Turkish troops before the joint patrols started.
The training will take place in Turkey.
Turkey has been infuriated with Washington's support for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia - which it views as a terrorist organization - and prior to the June agreement it had threatened to push on with a ground offensive against the YPG in Manbij despite the presence of U.S. troops there.
Turkey's detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson on terrorism charges has also hit relations between Ankara and Washington.
U.S. President Donald Trump, angered by Brunson's detention, authorized a doubling of duties on aluminum and steel imported from Turkey in August. Turkey retaliated by increasing tariffs on U.S. cars, alcohol and tobacco imports.
Mattis said he would speak about the situation in Syria and militancy in Africa while in Paris, where he is expected to meet his French counterpart and President Emmanuel Macron.
Turkey and Russia agreed in mid-September to enforce a new demilitarized zone in Syria's Idlib province from which rebels will be required to withdraw.
Before the deal and when a Syrian government offensive on Idlib seemed imminent, France had said that it was prepared to carry out strikes on Syrian targets if chemical weapons were used.

The Conservatives, meeting for their annual conference, are deeply divided over Brexit and have just six months before a deadline to reach an agreement with the European Union expires. 
Rees-Mogg, considered a possible successor to May, said the Conservatives' lack of a parliamentary majority meant it would be difficult for an alternative leader to push through an ambitious Brexit deal.
""The (Conservative) party often thinks the easy solution is to change the leader and actually changing leader usually causes more problems than it solves and it is therefore in my mind sensible and prudent to back the prime minister,"" he told an event on the sidelines of the conference.

""Super-Canada"" is a proposal by some Brexiteers for a more ambitious free trade agreement than the one between Canada and the EU reached in 2016. That agreement, which took seven years to negotiate, removed almost all tariffs between the two trading blocs.

(Reuters) - Local authorities in Missouri do not know the locations of more than 1,200 sex offenders, including nearly 800 who would be classified as the most dangerous, according to a report by the state auditor released on Monday. 
Missouri law requires those convicted or found guilty of sexual offenses to register their name, address and other information with local law enforcement, the auditor's office said. The information is made public through a database and website maintained by the Missouri State Highway Patrol.
But because of local officials' inadequate enforcement of registration requirements, 1,259 registered sex offenders failed to follow law, Missouri State Auditor Nicole Galloway said. 
""Law enforcement can't track the location of registered sex offenders if sex offender laws are not enforced,"" Galloway said in a statement. ""This also takes away the ability of Missourians to effectively use the sex offender registry when making decisions to protect themselves and their families.""
The state auditor serves as Missouri's independent watchdog agency. 
The audit found that at least 794 of the 1,259 offenders committed offenses including rape, sodomy or child molestation.
Failure to comply with registration requirements is a felony, but the audit showed that less than 10 percent of non-compliant offenders had an active arrest warrant.
The audit recommended that local authorities check the data in the registry. ""The addition of these automated edits will help reduce but may never be able to identify all the 'human error' entries,"" Lieutenant Colonel Eric Olson, Missouri State Highway Patrol acting superintendent, said in a Sept. 5 letter to Galloway. The letter was included in the auditor's report.
Olson added that accuracy issues will be addressed in future training sessions for staff who register offenders.
The registry was implemented in 1995, the report said. Missouri was one of 18 states that initially required lifetime registration for all sex offenders, but the state later provided a process for certain registered offenders to petition for removal from the registry.

BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Britain cannot be bullied, Brexit minister Dominic Raab said on Monday, sharpening the government's criticism of the European Union for taunting Prime Minister Theresa May and souring difficult Brexit talks.
May's ministers have come out one by one at their party's annual conference in the city of Birmingham to warn the EU that they will embrace leaving without a deal if the bloc fails to show ""respect"" in the talks to end Britain's membership.
Just six months before Britain is due to leave the EU in the country's biggest shift in foreign and trade policy in more than 40 years, May faces growing criticism over her proposals not only in her governing party but also in Brussels.
Party unity is on British ministers' minds, and they are encouraging the faithful to direct their anger at the EU rather than at their prime minister, who some euroskeptic Conservatives accuse of leading Britain towards a ""Brexit in name only"".
But the new strident tone has annoyed many in Brussels, especially when foreign minister Jeremy Hunt compared the bloc to the Soviet Union, the master of several states in eastern Europe which saw membership of the EU as a measure of their freedom.
Other ministers, such as finance minister Philip Hammond, have taken a softer tone, pointing out that leaving without a deal could hurt Britain's economy, the world's fifth largest.
But Raab said he had called on the EU to match the ""ambition and pragmatism"" Britain had put forward with May's Chequers proposals, named after her country residence where an agreement with her ministers was hashed out in July.
""Unfortunately, that wasn't on display in Salzburg,"" he said, describing a summit last month in the Austrian city where EU leaders rejected parts of the Chequers plan.
""Our prime minister has been constructive and respectful. In return we heard jibes from senior leaders and we saw a starkly one-sided approach to negotiation.""
""What is unthinkable is that this government, or any British government, could be bullied by the threat of some kind of economic embargo, into signing a one-sided deal against our country's interests,"" Raab said, later calling again on the EU to move their position and meet Britain half way.
Instead of the much-hoped-for staging post, the Salzburg summit has become a byword for a sharp deterioration in the atmosphere of the talks, when British government officials felt May was ambushed by the other EU leaders over Brexit.
""NO CHERRIES""
A tweet by European Council President Donald Tusk showing him offering May a selection of cakes with the comment: ""A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries"" ""certainly had an impact"", one official said.
With no divorce deal and a standoff over the shape of any future relationship, the possibility of a ""no deal Brexit"" has increased, with some businesses preparing for what they see as a worst case scenario.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the discussion in Britain over Brexit was still far removed from reality. 
""The world is watching,"" said Matthew Fell, chief UK policy director at the Confederation of British Industry. 
""Every signal is hugely important in terms of setting the tone. So the more that people can coalesce around some areas of agreement such as an industrial strategy, innovation and skills would be hugely helpful,"" he told Reuters.
But one source close to the government said there was now a sense that the EU had realized that the tone set in Salzburg was ""perhaps a bit off"" and, behind the scenes, conversations between the two sides were more constructive.
Raab later said the government was open to looking at regulatory checks to try to ease talks on a so-called backstop to prevent a return to a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland - one of the outstanding issues yet to be agreed.
Hammond, for one, was keen to pursue a more positive stance.
After Brexit, Britain and the EU will still ""be neighbors and we are going to have to carry on living with each other,"" he told the conference, again backing May's Chequers plan.
""Mr Tusk says it won't work. But that's what people said about the light bulb in 1878. Our job is to prove him wrong.""
But Hunt's popular line at conference, that the EU was acting like the Soviet Union, did little to soothe relations, provoking those eastern members of the bloc which only regained full independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. They joined the EU more than a decade later.
Lithuania's EU commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis told Hunt he was born in a Soviet gulag forced labor camp and was jailed by the Soviet KGB state security agency.
""Happy to brief you on the main differences between EU and Soviet Union,"" he said. ""Anytime. Whatever helps.""
But back in Birmingham, it was Raab, winning a standing ovation for his story about his father's journey from then Czechoslovakia after the Nazi invasion, who summed up Britain's new combative stance.

""The EU's theological approach allows no room for serious compromise,"" he said. ""If the EU want a deal, they need to get serious.""

PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said on Monday he did not see relations between the United States and China worsening, a day after his trip to China was canceled and tensions have started affecting military ties.
The United States and China are embroiled in a trade war, sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's accusations that China has long sought to steal U.S. intellectual property, limit access to its own market and unfairly subsidize state-owned companies.
Reuters reported on Sunday that China canceled a security meeting with Mattis that had been planned for October. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Mattis was no longer going to China.
""There's tension points in the relationship, but based on discussions coming out of New York last week and other things that we have coming up, we do not see it getting worse,"" Mattis told a small group of reporters traveling with him to Paris.
""We're just going to have to learn how to manage this relationship ... We'll sort this out,"" Mattis added.
Mattis said he would talk to his Chinese counterpart directly ""when the time is right.""
Friction between the world's two biggest economies is moving beyond trade, with Trump accusing Beijing of seeking to interfere in congressional elections.
On Sunday, a U.S. Navy destroyer sailed near islands claimed by China in the South China Sea. Just days before, the U.S. military flew B-52 bombers in vicinity of the South China Sea.
While such operations are common, they have led to angry reactions from China in the past. Beijing's claims in the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passed each year, are contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. 
China recently denied a request for a U.S. warship to visit Hong Kong and postponed other joint military talks in protest against a U.S. decision to impose sanctions on a Chinese military agency and its director.
China has been particularly angered by recent overtures by the United States toward Taiwan.
The United States last week approved the sale of spare parts for F-16 fighter planes and other military aircraft worth up to $330 million to Taiwan, which China considers a wayward province.
Washington has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is the island's main source of arms. China regularly says Taiwan is the most sensitive issue in its ties with the United States.

""We've just got to sort out, as I've said before, when we step on each others toes, how we're going to deal with it,"" Mattis added.

240,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>","U.N. agency, worried about safety, pulls some international staff out of Gaza","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The United Nations agency that supports Palestinian refugees withdrew some of its international staff from the Gaza Strip on Monday, saying it was concerned for their safety, a statement from the organization said. 
Anger has mounted in Gaza over the past few weeks among Palestinian employees of UNRWA (The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees). Facing a financial crisis, the organization has had to cut jobs in Gaza, sparking strikes and protests.
""UNRWA today decided to temporarily withdraw part of its international staff from Gaza following a series of worrying security incidents affecting its personnel in the Strip,"" the agency said. 
UNRWA said its director of operations and other international staff would remain in Gaza and that its operations continue there. A source in Gaza said 13 international staff were withdrawn and six more remained in the Strip. 
""Earlier today, a number of staff were harassed and prevented from carrying out their duties by individuals protesting recent measures resulting from UNRWA’s challenging financial situation,"" the statement said. 
Hani al-Omari, a local UNRWA employee, told Reuters that dozens of people whose jobs were recently cut or reduced had gathered outside a hotel where they heard UNRWA international staff were meeting, some surrounding the vehicle of one of them.
""We wanted to send a message to them that they will not be comfortable while they plan to execute us by cutting our jobs,” al-Omari said. 
UNRWA in its statement called on Gaza authorities to ""provide effective protection to its employees and facilities"".
Gaza is controlled by the Islamist Hamas movement. 
Eyad al-Bozom, spokesman for the Hamas-led interior ministry in Gaza, said the ministry was committed to the protection of UNRWA's staff and facilities. 
""The protection measures did not change, but due to the recent job reductions in the Gaza Strip there has been anger among the employees. We will not let these protests develop and we will not allow any attacks against employees or facilities,” he said. 
UNRWA provides services to about 5 million Palestinian refugees across Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank and Gaza. Most are descendants of some 700,000 Palestinians who were driven out of their homes or fled fighting in the 1948 war that led to Israel's creation.
In August, the United States announced a halt in its aid to UNRWA, calling it an ""irredeemably flawed operation"", prompting the organization to appeal to donors for help
UNRWA chief Pierre Krahenbuhl said on Thursday that the agency received contributions of $118 million, narrowing a budget gap for this year to $68 million. The pledges were made at a meeting on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations in New York.

Gaza has been for years in deep economic crisis. With poverty rampant and unemployment high, many of its two million residents depend on UNRWA services.

Bolsonaro, a former army officer who has expressed admiration for Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship, said on Friday that he would not accept defeat. Opinion polls show him winning the most votes in Sunday's first round but losing to the PT's Fernando Haddad in a probable run-off three weeks later.
""He has changed that view. If he is defeated, he loses,"" retired General Hamilton Mourão told reporters at Brasilia airport.
Bolsonaro has previously accused the PT of planning to rig the elections, which some Brazilians have interpreted as a warning intended to encourage a military coup if he did not win.
Mourão said Brazil's military would ""logically"" accept a PT victory, even if that meant, in his view, a return to incompetent government and corruption.
""The armed forces are sitting quiet, following their commanders,"" the general said.
Mourão was relieved of his military command in 2015 and given a staff job after he publicly criticized then PT President Dilma Rousseff. Last year, he suggested that the military should take over if Brasilia's courts failed to stop political corruption.
Brazil's most polarized election since the return to civilian government in 1985 is heading for a close race between the right and the left, according to the polls. 

If neither Bolsonaro nor Haddad win a majority of the vote in the first round, a run-off between the two top candidates will be held on Oct. 28. Major polling firms Ibope and Datafolha have found Haddad would likely win.

U.N. efforts have repeatedly failed to broker a settlement over the territory, contested between Morocco and the Algerian-backed Polisario since Spanish colonial power left in 1974.
U.N. Special Envoy for Western Sahara, Horst Kohler, has invited the foreign ministers of Morocco, Algeria and Mauritania as well as the secretary general of the Polisario Front for a meeting in Geneva, the spokeswoman said.
Morocco has insisted that Algeria should be brought to the negotiation table accusing it of backing Polisario militarily and financially. Algeria denies the accusations.
""The purpose of the meeting is to take stock of developments since the last round of negotiations, address regional issues, and discuss the next steps in the political process on Western Sahara,"" the U.N. spokeswoman said.
The talks come after Kohler’s second visit to the region in June and after his briefing to the Security Council on 8 August, during which he announced his intention of organizing a meeting before the end of the year.
In 1991 the U.N. brokered a ceasefire between Morocco and the Polisario and supported a referendum on the region’s future, including the possibility of independence. The vote never happened.
Morocco has offered autonomy to Western Sahara, a thinly populated region that has rich fishing waters and phosphate deposits, and may also have oil and gas reserves.
Polisario and its ally Algeria reject this and say they want a referendum, with independence for Western Sahara as one of the options.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected Bill Cosby's bid to avoid a defamation lawsuit brought by a well-known former model who said the comedian sought to destroy her reputation after she publicly accused him of rape.
The justices, acting six days after Cosby was sentenced to three to 10 years in prison in Pennsylvania for a 2004 sexual assault involving another woman, declined to hear his appeal of a lower court ruling allowing the lawsuit brought by Janice Dickinson in state court in California to proceed.
The justices took their action in the Cosby case against the backdrop of the #MeToo movement opposing sexual assault and harassment at the same time that President Donald Trump's nominee for a vacancy on the high court, Brett Kavanaugh, has denied allegations of his own sexual misconduct.
The court's rejection of the case came on the first day of its new term, which runs through June. 
Dickinson gave a national television interview in 2014 accusing Cosby of raping her in 1982. In response, Cosby's lawyer Martin Singer sent letters to other media outlets warning them not to publish Dickinson's ""defamatory fabrication,"" adding that she was ""seeking publicity to bolster her fading career."" 
A subsequent news release from Cosby's team said Dickinson was lying. Singer also sent out statements denying similar accusations by other women against Cosby. 
Dickinson sued for defamation, claiming the letter and news release aimed to destroy her reputation. Cosby sought to toss those claims, saying Dickinson was trying to stifle his free speech rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.
Cosby was sentenced on Sept. 25 for his conviction on three counts of aggravated indecent assault for the drugging and sexual assault of Andrea Constand, a former Temple University administrator, at his Philadelphia home in 2004.
More than 50 women in recent years have accused Cosby, who starred in the popular 1980s sitcom ""The Cosby Show,"" of assault and using drugs to incapacitate them. 
A California court of appeals last November rejected Cosby's argument in the Dickinson dispute, allowing the case to proceed. 
Urging the Supreme Court to take the case, Cosby had noted that in two separate cases federal appeals courts held that Singer's statements responding to accusers were constitutionally protected speech. Cosby said in a court filing that the decision he was challenging could dissuade attorneys from asserting their clients' innocence.

STOCKHOLM/LONDON (Reuters) - American James Allison and Japanese Tasuku Honjo won the 2018 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine on Monday for game-changing discoveries about how to harness and manipulate the immune system to fight cancer.
The scientists' work in the 1990s has since swiftly led to new and dramatically improved therapies for cancers such as melanoma and lung cancer, which had previously been extremely difficult to treat.
""The seminal discoveries by the two Laureates constitute a landmark in our fight against cancer,"" the Nobel Assembly at Sweden's Karolinska Institute said as it awarded the prize of nine million Swedish crowns ($1 million).
Allison and Honjo showed releasing the brakes on the immune system can unleash its power to attack cancer. The resulting treatments, known as immune checkpoint blockade, have ""fundamentally changed the outcome"" for some advanced cancer patients,"" the Nobel institute said.
Medicine is the first of the Nobel Prizes awarded each year. The prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were created in accordance with the will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel and have been awarded since 1901.
The literature prize will not be handed out this year after the awarding body was hit by a sexual misconduct scandal. A Swedish court on Monday found a man at the center of the scandal guilty of rape and sentenced him to two years in jail.
REVOLUTIONIZED CANCER TREATMENT 
Allison's and Honjo's work focused on proteins that act as brakes on the immune system - preventing the body's main immune cells, known as T-cells, from attacking tumors effectively.
Allison, a professor at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, worked on a protein known as CTLA-4 and realized that if this could be blocked, a brake would be released.
""It immediately occurred to me, and some of the people in my lab, that maybe we can use this to unleash the immune system to attack cancer cells,"" Allison told a news conference after getting the prize.
Honjo, a professor at Kyoto University since 1984, separately discovered a second protein called PD-1 and found that it too acted as an immune system brake, but with a different mechanism.
The discoveries led to the creation of a multibillion-dollar market for new cancer medicines.
Bristol-Myers Squibb's (N:BMY) CTLA-4 therapy Yervoy was the first such drug to win approval, in 2011. However, it is medicines targeting PD-1 blockade that have proved a bigger commercial hit, led by Merck & Co's (N:MRK) Keytruda in 2014.
These and rival drugs from Roche (S:ROG), AstraZeneca (L:AZN),  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and Sanofi (PA:SASY) now offer new options for patients with melanoma, lung and bladder cancers.
Sales of such medicines, which are given as infusions, are expected to reach some $15 billion this year, according to Thomson Reuters consensus forecasts. Some analysts see eventual revenues of $50 billion.
Honjo, who is now 76, told a news conference in Tokyo he was honored to get the Nobel, but his work was not yet done.
""I would like to keep on doing my research ...so that this immune treatment could save more cancer patients,"" he said.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe congratulated Honjo in a phone call, telling him: ""I believe the achievements of your research have given cancer patients hope and light.""
Allison told a news conference he was in a ""state of shock"" hours after learning from his son that he had won a Nobel prize.
""As a basic scientist, to have my work really impact people is just one of the best things,"" he said. ""I think it's everybody's dream. And I've been lucky enough to do work that is benefiting people now."" 
Commenting on the award, Kevin Harrington, a professor at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said the work had revolutionized cancer treatment.

""We’ve gone from being in a situation where patients were effectively untreatable to having a range of immunotherapy options that, when they work, work very well indeed,"" he said in a statement. ""For some patients we see their tumors shrink or completely disappear and are effectively cured.""

Erdogan visited Berlin last week in an attempt to mend bilateral ties that have deteriorated since a number of German citizens were jailed in Turkey in a crackdown that has followed a failed coup in July 2016.
The newspaper quoted Erdogan as telling reporters on the flight home: ""I don't know all of the names but it is a substantial list. A list of 136 people in Germany.""
He did not specify which groups were included, but was also quoted as saying Germany should be more effective in countering members of the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and leftist militant group DHKP-C.
A report by Germany-based broadcaster Deutsche Welle Turkey cited German government officials as saying Erdogan had not delivered a list.
There was no immediate response from the Berlin foreign ministry to a Reuters request for clarification.
In 2016, Germany extradited 55 people to Turkey including eight over alleged terrorism offences, according to German data, but extradition requests by Ankara since the coup attempt have borne little fruit.
Ankara says Gulen's network orchestrated the failed coup. He denies any involvement. Erdogan asked Germany during his visit to label Gulen's network a terrorist organization but Berlin said it needed more evidence.
Erdogan said his administration had in the past delivered documents to Berlin containing the names of more than 4,000 people with links to the PKK, adding that there was a difference in the ""understanding of terror"" between Turkey and both Germany and the United States.
Ties between Ankara and Washington are also at a low ebb, and Erdogan said separately on Monday he would resist U.S. efforts to impose sanctions over the trial of a Christian pastor detained for two years in Turkey over alleged links to coup supporters. The pastor denies the allegations.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's closing of its ports to rescued migrants is driving up deaths at sea, an Italian think tank said on Monday, using calculations based on numbers collected by U.N. agencies.
Since taking power in June, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who heads the far-right League party, has refused to allow charity rescue ships to dock in Italy, a policy that has broad popular support after the arrival of almost 650,000 people from North Africa since 2014.
Though arrivals are down 80 percent from last year, Salvini's hardline on immigration has helped more than double support for his party since the March national election. 
But International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimates of the number of dead or missing at sea suggest there are dire consequences to this policy, according to Matteo Villa, a researcher at Italy's ISPI think tank.
In the four months since Salvini took power, the average number of deaths per day has risen to 8, compared with 3.2 in the period between July 16, 2017 and May 31, 2018, when the previous government was in charge, Villa's calculations show.
The death rate in September was 19 percent, so about one in five migrants who attempted to reach Italy from North Africa perished. That's the highest monthly death rate recorded since at least 2012, when reliable data began to be collected, Villa said.
""These data show there's a problem,"" Villa told Reuters, adding that the lack of civilian ships at sea also likely means recent estimates of dead are too low because there are no witnesses. 
There currently are no civilian charity ships patrolling the waters off of Libya after the latest standoff on the high seas, which involved the Aquarius rescue vessel, ending on Sunday.
In response to the report, a source close to Salvini told Reuters that the minister's objective is to stop departures altogether, and the presence of the charity ships had caused people smugglers to send migrants on less safe boats.
""The objective is to bring real refugees to Europe by plane instead of these journeys of hope,"" the source said. 
""The presence of non-governmental groups close to the Libyan coasts has led smugglers to use smaller and less secure boats to cover just a few miles, hoping that the migrants are picked up by the NGOs. In this way, the risk for migrants increased, and traffickers increased profits,"" the source said.
NGOs have repeatedly denied helping or having any ties whatsoever to traffickers. 
On Monday in Geneva, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi repeated a call for more rescuers at sea.
""Rescue at sea - a marker of our shared humanity - has been taken hostage by politics,"" Grandi said.

The 33-year deal will allow the company, part of Shandong Hi-Speed Group, to charge users of a 42 kilometer road it will build and fund at an estimated cost of 297 million euros to link the northwestern towns of Banja Luka and Prijedor.
The concession fee would include one-off payment amounting to 1.5 percent of the total investment or 4.4 million euros, and an annual fee amounting to 5 percent of revenues earned through concession, the Serb Republic government said in a statement.
According to an agreement signed last November in Budapest, Shandong will project, build, manage, maintain and fund the road construction, while the Serb Republic will pay it an annual concession fee for the road availability, the government said.
The deal represents the first road construction concession for China in the Balkans.
Chinese firms are implementing a raft of projects in the region, mainly in energy but also in the construction sector. These are worth around 3.8 billion euros in Bosnia alone.

LUCKNOW/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The deadly shooting of an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) manager by police in India's most-populous state prompted human rights activists and opposition parties to demand reform, saying it was only the latest in a series of extrajudicial killings by local police.
The government of Uttar Pradesh, run by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, attempted to quickly defuse the attacks by offering the dead manager's widow a state government job and compensation for the death of her husband. 
Police in the northern state also issued a public apology and assured it would act against the two officers involved.
Two police constables on motor-bike patrol early on Saturday morning stopped the car of mid-level Apple sales manager, Vivek Tiwari, who was returning from an iPhone store launch with another Apple employee. 
There have been conflicting accounts of what happened next. 
The patrolman who shot Tiwari told reporters on Saturday: ""I didn't shoot at him. The bullet was shot by mistake."" But the state's top police officer, O.P. Singh, said on Saturday that the officer claimed to have fired in self-defense.
One of Tiwari's friends said he had been told by his family that when Tiwari declined to step out of the car, he was shot.
A photograph from the site of the incident, which occurred about 13 km (8 miles) from state capital Lucknow, showed Tiwari's damaged sports utility vehicle with a cracked windshield. 
On Monday, state chief minister Yogi Adityanath met Tiwari's wife, assured her a job and at least 2.5 million rupees ($34,326) in compensation. The two officers have been arrested and the Uttar Pradesh state police officer Singh said he was determined to ""punish & wean out such rogues in uniform"". 
Though such killings are frequently reported across India, swift police action is rare. But Tiwari's case has resonated as he worked for one of the best-known companies in the world and belonged to the upper caste Brahmin community.
POLICE MISUSING POWER
Apple on Sunday said it was shocked and heartbroken by Tiwari's death, and extended deepest sympathies to his family.
Human rights activists said the state, which has a high crime rate and a reputation for gangsterism, needed to do more to stop police killings of civilians.
State police in September invited journalists to film a confrontation between police and two armed men in Aligarh city in which the two men were shot dead, according to media reports. The clash began when the two opened fire on police, police said.
India's National Human Rights Commission said 19 alleged criminals were killed and 89 injured in 433 police encounters in Uttar Pradesh in six months to August 2017. 
In February, the commission said the state's police officers were ""feeling free, misusing their power in the light of an undeclared endorsement given by the higher ups"".
""It is unfortunate that there is an uproar only about this case and not questions raised about Uttar Pradesh police operating procedures,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch. 
""Suspects have to be arrested, prosecuted, not killed on the streets by police,"" she said. 
The case has also drawn political attention. Pawan Khera, a spokesman for the main opposition Congress party, blamed the state government for the killing and called for ""stringent action"" against the police officers involved in the shootout.
The incident is a stark reminder of how police brutality is widely prevalent in India.
JOVIAL HARD WORKER
Earlier this year, police in the port city of Thoothukudi in southern state of Tamil Nadu gave no warning before firing with live ammunition on protesters seeking the closure of a copper smelter, killing at least ten people.
""Police in Uttar Pradesh have become trigger happy, we have to see that minimum use of force is done,"" said Vappala Balachandran, a former deputy police commissioner in Mumbai.
""The central government should ensure that the police, their training methods are reformed"". 
Tiwari is survived by his wife and two daughters. 
Ajay Kumar, one of Tiwari's friends, described him as a hard working, jovial person who was fond of singing folk songs. 
He had faced financial hardship but then his life changed after 2014 when he landed a job as an Apple manager responsible for managing sales and working with the company's partners in the state.
""It was only now that he had started enjoying his life, we still can't believe he's dead,"" Kumar told Reuters, adding that he was also involved in a poster campaign after the incident. 

""Police uncle, if you stop the car, dad will stop. Please don't shoot,"" read the poster, which was pasted on some cars in the city of Lucknow.

James Monday Enoka, a police commissioner in Yambio, told Reuters six of the injured were in critical condition and that they had been evacuated to the capital Juba for medical treatment.
The explosion occurred on Friday around 11 p.m. local time when someone threw ""a hand grenade into a club where 500 people were dancing...we found four people dead on (the) spot,"" Enoka said. 
He said the death toll had increased to 10 by Monday while dozens others were injured.
He said the incident was not related to the ongoing civil war which has gripped South Sudan since 2013, pitting President Salva Kiir's military against opponents led by his former Vice President Riek Machar. 
""It is an isolated criminal act and the criminal will face a court of law,"" he said.
At least 190,000 people are estimated to have died in the conflict since it started.

Bolivia surrendered most of its former coastline to Chile in a 1904 treaty following the War of the Pacific.

SKOPJE (Reuters) - Macedonia's hopes of joining the European Union and NATO were in limbo on Monday, a day after voters backed a plan to change the country's name by a large margin but failed to hit the 50 percent turnout required for the referendum result to be valid.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said he would press on regardless with a vote in parliament to endorse the change of name to the 'Republic of North Macedonia' but the defense minister said an early election might now prove necessary, potentially derailing the whole plan due to a tight timeframe.
Some 91 percent of voters backed the name change, demanded by neighboring Greece as a precondition for it lifting its veto on Macedonia joining the EU and NATO. But turnout was just 36.9 percent, final figures showed, far below the required threshold.
The EU, echoing the pro-Western Zaev, hailed the referendum result as a ringing endorsement of Macedonia's plans to join the bloc and NATO. But Russia, which opposes NATO eastern expansion, said tersely it expected the law in Macedonia to be respected.
Zaev lacks the two thirds majority in parliament to push through the name change, and the main nationalist opposition VMRO-DPMNE has vowed to block the legislation. Many of its supporters did not vote in order to invalidate the result.
""In the coming week we will assess if we can secure the necessary majority for the constitutional changes, and if not we will call an early election,"" Defence Minister Radmila Sekerinska told Reuters.
""The downside is that the election would postpone adoption of the constitutional changes for 45 to 60 days,"" she said. 
""POLITICAL CRISIS""
Political analysts said the outcome greatly complicated the tiny ex-Yugoslav republic's push to join Western structures.
""Instead of having a clearer picture the outcome of the referendum will only deepen the political crisis,' said Petar Arsovski a political analyst. ""We are likely heading towards early elections and Macedonia does not have time for that.""
Greece and the EU tried to put a brave face on the setback.
""We hope that Mr. Zaev's initiative for a constitutional reform will be successful,"" Greek government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos said on Monday.
""The Greek government will continue with sobriety and prudence ... to support the need for an implementation of the deal. This opportunity must not be wasted,"" he said.
Greece has insisted on the change because it views the name 'Macedonia' as implying a territorial claim on a northern Greek region of that name. Greece's parliament must also approve the June name deal and, like Zaev, leftist Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras also faces opposition from his nationalist foes.
An early election could be called in Macedonia for the end of November at the earliest, pushing the constitutional changes into the spring.
""The biggest risk is that this drags on and the EU’s electoral calendar overtakes things,"" an EU official said, referring to next May's elections to the European Parliament. 
EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and EU Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn said in a joint statement: ""The (Macedonia) parliament will now be called upon to proceed with the next steps for implementation of the name agreement by deciding on adoption"" of the legal changes.
A NATO diplomat was more circumspect, saying the alliance did not want to be drawn into Macedonian domestic politics. 
""But we have made it very clear that should the country turn its back on this opportunity, we don’t expect it to arise again for a very long time,"" he said. 

In Moscow, which regards NATO enlargement as a threat to its own security, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""We are observing closely and of course think that all the processes should remain within the framework of the law.

The Papua New Guinea-based airline said on Friday all 47 passengers and crew on board had safely evacuated the Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737 jet after it landed in a lagoon during heavy rain and reduced visibility.
Air Niugini said in a statement on Saturday that it could not account for one male passenger, but on Sunday it said other passengers had confirmed he had safely evacuated the plane and was seen in a local dinghy that transported passengers and crew to the shore.
In a statement on Monday evening, Air Niugini CEO Tahawar Durrani said the body of the unaccounted male passenger was discovered by divers during the day as they conducted a further search of the downed jet and the surrounding area in the lagoon.

""Our outreach team is in touch with the man's family and we are making arrangements to repatriate his body,"" Durrani said.

""The willing-buyer willing-seller principle has not delivered results. Careful consideration should be given to expropriation,"" President Hage Geingob said at the opening of the Second National Land Conference in the capital Windhoek.
The southern African country wants to transfer 43 percent, or 15 million hectares (58,000 square miles) of its arable agricultural land, to previously disadvantaged blacks by 2020. At the end of 2015, 27 percent has been redistributed, according to the Namibia Agriculture Union. 
""We need to revisit constitutional provisions which allow for the expropriation of land with just compensation, as opposed to fair compensation, and look at foreign ownership of land, especially absentee land owners,"" Geingob said.
""It is in all our interest, particularly the ""haves"", to ensure a drastic reduction in inequality, by supporting the redistributive model required to alter our skewed economic structure. We should all be cognizant of the fact that this is ultimately an investment in peace,"" he said.
Namibia's neighbor and regional economic powerhouse South Africa is also in the process of amending land ownership laws - a move that has shaken investor nerves locally and abroad, leading to a controversial tweet by United States President Donald Trump in August criticizing the move by Pretoria.
As in South Africa, thousands of black Namibians were driven off their land in the 19th and 20th centuries, banished to barren and often crowded homelands known as Bantustans while being denied official ownership or tenure rights.

In the second quarter Namibia's GDP contracted for the ninth straight quarter, the longest such streak since at least 2008.

Passed by Israel's parliament in July, the Nation State Law declares that only Jews have the right of self-determination in Israel and downgrades Arabic from its status as an official state language.
The legislation has come under fierce criticism at home and abroad. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended the law, saying it is necessary in order to fend off Palestinian challenges to Jewish self-determination. 
Across the Palestinian territories on Monday, Palestinian schools, universities, government offices and shops were closed in solidarity with the Israeli Arab minority which shut down its private sector. 
""It is the minimum we can do for our people against the racist nation-state law,"" said Abu Jabir al-Iraqi, a resident of the Israeli Arab town Taybeh.
Many of Israel's Arab citizens also identify as Palestinian. They make up a fifth of Israel's 9 million citizens. Israeli law grants them full equal rights, but many say they face discrimination and are treated as second-class citizens.
Some Palestinians, however, questioned whether the strike was effective. 
""I don't know if the strike we are holding in the West Bank is affecting the Jews or not, or whether it is merely shutting down all the services for nothing,"" said Diaa Rayan, 34, as he drove his car through the Palestinian city of Ramallah.
""This strike will make no change,"" said Ismail al-Saidi, a butcher from Gaza. ""To make a change we need weapons to fight the enemy.""
In his address to the UN General Assembly on Thursday, Netanyahu said condemnations of the law were ""outlandish attacks.""
""When Israel is called racist for making Hebrew its official language and the Star of David its national flag, when Israel is labeled an apartheid state for declaring itself the nation state of the Jewish people, this is downright preposterous,"" he said.

Buhari's ruling party candidate was narrowly elected governor of the southwestern state of Osun in a vote on Friday which the main opposition party said was marred by voter intimidation and suggested that the 2019 elections in Africa's top oil producing country were unlikely to be fair.
Observers from Britain, the United States and the European Union said in a joint statement that they had witnessed widespread incidents of interference and intimidation of voters, journalists, and civil society observers by some party supporters and security agencies in Osun.
In a televised address to mark the anniversary of the west African country's independence from British rule, Buhari, who will seek a second term in February 2019 elections, tried to address concerns over Nigeria's Independent National Electoral Commision (INEC), which the opposition has said was partly to blame for the manner in which the Osun vote was conducted. 
""I have committed myself many times to ensure that elections are fully participatory, free and fair and that the Independent National Electoral Commission will be exactly independent and properly staffed and resourced,"" said Buhari in his address.
He did not give further details.
Elections in Africa's most populous nation have for years been marred by allegations of irregularities including vote rigging, voter intimidation and violence. 
On Saturday Buhari's ruling All Progressives Congress party nominated him as its candidate to stand for re-election next year. The main opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) has yet to select a candidate.
Friday's Osun poll was a re-run after the INEC declared the first vote, in which the main opposition candidate secured a win, as inconclusive due to the high number of spoiled ballots.
PDP members criticized INEC for its handling of the election and accused it and security agencies of failing to ensure the second vote was free and fair. 

INEC's board members are chosen by the president subject to parliament's approval. An INEC spokesman did not respond to request for comment.

The United States offered two options: either new  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) F-16V jets or new Boeing (NYSE:BA) F-18 Super Hornets. Sweden offered new Saab Gripen jets, while Italy proposed supplying second-hand Eurofighters.
""The offers will be assessed and then a political decision will be taken,"" Deputy Defence Minister Atanas Zaprianov told reporters upon the offering of the bids.

The deal will help Bulgaria, which joined NATO in 2004, improve its compliance with the alliance's standards.
It is Bulgaria's biggest military deal, and the tender had to be relaunched this year after a parliamentary commission ruled last year that a previous tender needed to be relaunched. In the previous tender, the Gripen jets had been favored.

Journalists working at Index.hu fear the two investors who took control of the news portal last month may be linked to Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his ruling right-wing Fidesz Party and may try to curb their editorial freedom.
""On Monday morning we did something unprecedented: we switched Index off for a time so that those who consider it important get a glimpse of what it would be like without us,"" editor-in-chief Attila Toth-Szenesi wrote in an article.
He said the acquisition was ""a matter of vital importance"" because the new owners control the Index, a separate company, CEMP, which sells its advertising space, and another company which provides the editorial systems.
Toth-Szenesi fears the acquisition was somehow funded by associates of Orban through a system known in Hungary as the National System of Cooperation (NER). Under the auspices of the NER, set up in 2010 to counter liberal values and champion nationalist policies, some of Orban's associates have won an increasing share of publicly funded business., 
""In Hungary today those who are able to lend billions to the buyers must belong to Orban's National System of Cooperation,"" Toth-Szenesi wrote, announcing a crowd funding campaign that he said would help reduce the outlet's financial reliance on CEMP.
By 1200 GMT on Monday, the campaign had raised about 10 million forints ($36,000) from around 1,350 supporters.
MEDIA FREEDOM
Neither of the two new owners - Gabor Ziegler and Jozsef Oltyan - were available for comment on Monday. Ziegler has previously denied being a front-man for anybody else in the decision to acquire Index.
Oltyan is a member of a party in coalition with Fidesz, while Ziegler has been a staff member on Index's business side for nearly two decades.
Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs declined to comment on the matter on Monday.
Dozens of newspapers, radio and television stations critical of Orban - who won re-election in April on a landslide - have changed hands in the past four years. Some subsequently closed down, while others quickly and dramatically changed their tune.
The government denies undermining press freedom or trying to influence the media or its owners through the advertising market.
In Hungary advertisers have tended to advertise increasingly in pro-government news outlets, Reuters research has found, allowing them to prosper while media that take a more critical stance towards the Orban government have suffered.
Orban has been scathing in the past about the Index website, which carries investigations into alleged government corruption and editorials criticizing his anti-immigration, anti-European Union rhetoric alongside straightforward news.

TENDRIVSKA KOSA, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine will build a military base on the Azov Sea and has sent more forces to the area to counter a worsening Russian threat, Ukraine's armed forces head told Reuters, referring to an arm of the Black Sea that is a flashpoint of tensions with Moscow.
Ukraine has been at loggerheads with Russia since the 2014 annexation of Crimea and more than 10,000 people have died in fighting between Ukrainian troops and Moscow-backed separatists. Ukraine and NATO countries accuse Russia of supplying troops and heavy weapons to eastern Ukraine, which Moscow denies. 
Viktor Muzhenko, Chief of the General Staff, said Russia had moved beyond covert fighting in the Donbass region, home of a Kremlin-backed separatist insurgency, to building up its military presence on Ukraine's borders and nakedly aggressive actions against ships sailing to Ukrainian ports. 
The Azov Sea, a strategic arm of the Black Sea where Russia and Ukraine share the coastline, has become a flashpoint this year. Ukraine says Russia is preventing scores of vessels from reaching Ukrainian ports through spurious inspections and detentions. 
Washington too has called on Russia to stop ""harassing"" ships, and supplied Ukraine with U.S. patrol boats. Moscow in turn says Ukraine might try to blockade Crimea. 
""All those actions that are being taken in the Azov Sea region, are elements of building up our presence in this region for an adequate response to possible provocations by the Russian Federation,"" Muzhenko said. 
He said Ukraine had already deployed more air, land, sea and artillery forces to the area. 
Muzhenko ruled out suggestions that Ukrainian navy ships would escort commercial vessels across the sea to prevent them being stopped by Russian ships.
Russia says its checks on shipping are lawful.
SECURITY
""Russian checks on ships are intended exclusively to ensure security in the Azov Sea and Kerch Strait, they don't contradict international law as it applies to this maritime area,"" Maria Zakharova, Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman, told a news conference on Sept. 22.
Muzhenko was speaking to Reuters on Saturday aboard a military plane flying back from Tendrivska Kosa island on the south coast, on the last of five days of war games across different parts of Ukraine.
Part of those exercises took place on the Hungarian border, which caused consternation in Budapest. Ukraine and Hungary have become embroiled in a series of diplomatic rows over the use of Hungarian in Ukrainian schools and Hungary issuing passports to ethnic Hungarians across the border. 
Muzhenko denied the wargames were a show of strength toward Hungary, and said they were intended to counter any chance of Russia attacking Ukraine from the west.
""First of all, this concerns the ability to respond adequately to threats from the Russian Federation. We are talking about protecting our communications, about a possible response to threats, including in the west,"" he said. 
Washington has continued to support Ukraine under the Donald Trump administration, including supplying Javelin missiles to Ukraine, a step President Barack Obama shied away from. 
Muzhenko said the Javelins had been tested and his troops trained to use them, but they had not been deployed in battle yet. Asked whether Ukraine wanted to buy the U.S. Patriot air defense system, he said various options were being considered.

Gbagbo’s lawyers argued in a written submission that he need present no defense, as prosecutors had failed to provide enough evidence as they put their case against him to support a conviction.
But prosecutors said Gbagbo, who is accused of four counts of crimes against humanity and is being held in the court's detention center, does have a case to answer.
“There is evidence … upon which a trial chamber could reasonably convict the accused of the charges against them,” deputy prosecutor James Steward said.
The former Ivorian president is on trial for crimes including murder, rape, persecution and other inhumane acts allegedly committed after 2010 elections when Gbagbo and his supporters refused to accept his electoral defeat by rival Alassane Ouattara.
The hearings on a possible early acquittal run through Friday, with Gbagbo's side yet to present oral arguments.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Japan’s largest warship, the Kaga helicopter carrier, sailed into Sri Lanka's Colombo harbor this weekend, marking Tokyo's highest profile salvo in a diplomatic battle with China for influence along the region's vital commercial sea lanes. 
Japan has long provided low-interest loans and aid to Sri Lanka, helping it transform Colombo into a major trans-shipment port tapping the artery of global trade just south of the island that links Europe and the Middle East with Asia. 
Beijing has, however, emerged as a powerful rival across South Asia and beyond as it implements its Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. 
Both China and Japan are also flexing their military muscles further from home. China's navy is increasingly venturing beyond the Western Pacific and into the Indian Ocean as it targets a world-class blue water fleet by 2050, while Japan's military diplomacy is flourishing under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. 
""Japan's government is promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific and this deployment in the Asia Pacific is a component of that strategy,"" Rear Admiral Tatsuya Fukuda, the commander of the Kaga and its destroyer escort, said in his cabin as the carrier steamed for Colombo through the Indian Ocean.
""Maritime security and stability is of critical importance"" to an island nation like Japan, he added.
On its way to Sri Lanka, the 248 meter (814 ft) ship was shadowed by Chinese frigates in the South China Sea and carried out naval drills in the Philippines and Indonesia. It also drilled with a British Navy frigate before docking in Colombo on Sunday with 500 sailors and four submarine hunting helicopters aboard.
As part of the goodwill visit, the Kaga's crew also brought packets of colorful origami paper, crafting flowers for local children who came to tour the ship soon after it docked. 
TUSSLE WITH CHINA
The visit was intended to reassure Sri Lanka of Japan's willingness and capability to dispatch its most powerful military assets to a region where China is growing in influence.
“Sri Lanka, as a hub in the Indian Ocean, and upholding its commitment to a free and open Indian Ocean, welcomes naval vessels from all our partner nations, to interact with Sri Lanka's Navy,"" said Sri Lankan foreign ministry spokeswoman Mahishini Colonne. ""Several navy vessels from our partner countries have visited Sri Lanka this year already and the ship from Japan, a close bilateral partner, is welcomed in the same spirit.” 
Sri Lanka recently agreed to cede control of the new $1.5 billion Hambantota port on its southern coast to China Merchants Port Holdings in a bid to ease the debt burden it has accumulated with Beijing.
China's Foreign Ministry denies it engages in unsustainable or unwanted lending and says the port project will help Sri Lanka become an Indian Ocean logistics hub.
Tokyo's diplomatic counter-offensive has included a visit in January by Minister of Foreign Affairs Taro Kono, the first by a top Japanese diplomat in 16 years. In August, Japan's defense minister also went to Sri Lanka and visited Hambantota.
""Sri Lanka is a key country within the region and a core part of Japan's open and free Indo-Pacific strategy. A monopoly by any country at a Sri Lankan port would run counter to that,"" a foreign ministry official told Reuters, asking not to be identified because he is not authorized to talk to the media.
In March, Sri Lanka's President Maithripala Sirisena visited Tokyo for talks with Abe, who despite being constrained by a constitution that forbids the use of force overseas, has sought a greater role for his military in the region. 
That has worried China, and could be an issue as Abe prepares to travel to Beijing to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. 
""The message to China is that Japan with India and the United States and of course Sri Lanka has the capacity to engage militarily,"" said Nozomu Yoshitomi, a professor at Nihon University in Tokyo, and a former Ground Self Defence Force major general who advised the Japanese cabinet. 
OPPOSITION AT HOME
Such naval forays are a recent change that for some veteran sailors on the Kaga was unexpected. 
""When I joined, we would sail out for the day and train from morning till night. I never imagined that we would be deployed on actual missions like this,"" said Command Master Chief, Yasuhara Tohno, a 35 year navy veteran.
The Kaga is half-way through a two-month deployment that will see it visit India next.
In the last five years, Japanese naval vessels have stopped in Sri Lanka 50 times, according to Fukuda. 
But the Kaga's new role as a big stick of Japanese diplomacy is for some influential military experts in Japan foolhardy because it means deploying ships away from where they are needed more.
""I am strongly against it,"" said Yoji Koda, a retired admiral who is now a fellow at the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard. ""Our navy was tasked to kill submarines in the Western Pacific and guarantee the safety of U.S. naval forces. That is enough, we can't do anymore things.""
Japan has one of the biggest and most advanced navies in the world with more than 40 destroyers, four helicopter carriers and around 20 submarines. 
""We undertake far more missions than we did in the past. That means we are stretched in some areas but it is our job to complete the job with the equipment we have,"" said Fukuda, Kaga's commander. 
CARRIER AMBITION
While arguments over the future role of Japan's navy rage on within the MSDF and defense ministry, proponents of overseas operations appear for now to have gained the upper hand as Abe seeks a larger regional security role for his country. 
That could eventually lead to the acquisition of fixed wing aircraft carriers, two military officials told Reuters, asking not to be identified because they are not authorized to talk to the media. 
Doing so would put it in an exclusive club of countries including the United States, Russia, Britain and more recently China that able to project air power over long distances.
Details on Tokyo's plans may come before the end of the year, when Japan's defense ministry will publish two papers outlining its security goals and military procurement plans for the five years beginning in April 2019. 

Separate military sources earlier told Reuters those documents will include a commitment to acquire vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) F-35B stealth fighters that could be flown from the deck of the Kaga or its sister ship the Izumo.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Catholic bishops from China will for the first time attend a major Vatican meeting starting this week, the Vatican said on Monday, following a landmark agreement between the Holy See and Beijing.
""There will be two bishops from continental China. They were invited by the pope,"" Cardinal Lorenzo Baldisseri told a news conference. ""I think they are already on their way to Rome.""
The bishops will take part in a month-long meeting, known as a synod, that starts on Wednesday to discuss the role of young people in the 1.2 billion-member Church.
""In the past the Holy See invited bishops from continental China but they were never able to attend,"" Baldisseri said.
Baldisseri said it was the first time the Beijing government has allowed bishops to leave the country to attend a Vatican synod, meetings which take place every few years on a different topic.
He said it was a result of the improved relations between the Vatican and Beijing following the signing of the agreement on Sept. 22.
The deal, which was in the making for more than 10 years, gives the Vatican a long-desired say in the choice of bishops in China, though critics labeled the deal a sellout to the Communist government.
China's approximately 12 million Catholics have been split between an underground church swearing loyalty to the Vatican and the state-supervised Catholic Patriotic Association.
The Vatican has said the absence of a deal could have led to a schism between Chinese Catholics that would have been difficult to heal.

Concerns remain, however, over the fate of about 12 priests and bishops believed to be in detention in China.

Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to help companies struggling with massive labor shortages by lowering the hurdles for skilled workers from outside the European Union.
But the planned immigration law, due to be discussed at high-level coalition talks on Monday, risks angering those voters who feel neglected after Merkel's 2015 decision to admit more than a million refugees and migrants, mostly Muslims from the Middle East.
While a growing number of the refugees are finding jobs, the process is slow given the urgency of the need for skilled workers. It takes up to five years for a low-educated Syrian or Iraqi to learn German and get a professional qualification.
The coalition parties disagree over whether refugees who are already living in Germany should be allowed to shed their asylum status if they have found a job and learned German.
Seehofer, head of Merkel's more conservative Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), said he had worked out a compromise deal with Labour Minister Hubertus Heil from the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) ahead of Monday's talks.
Seehofer insisted that asylum seekers whose request had been rejected would have to leave Germany, regardless of whether they had found a job and learned German in the meantime.
However, there should be an exemption for those asylum seekers who cannot be deported because they would face a threat such as torture in their home country, Seehofer said.
""People say: Before they sit around, let them work,"" said Seehofer, whose CSU fears losing voters to the far-right in a regional election later this month.
Employers' associations and the center-left SPD want the new immigration law to include the possibility for refugees to shed their asylum status once they have found work and learned German.
""It's about preventing a situation where we send back the right people - and then have to painstakingly search for skilled workers abroad,"" Heil told Reuters in an interview last month.

Seehofer had previously opposed the 'Spurwechsel' (lane change) proposal because he feared it would encourage immigration by asylum seekers without the right skills.

266,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>","In tight election, Quebec weighs a shift to the right","By Allison Lampert
MONTREAL (Reuters) - Voters in the Canadian province of Quebec will cast ballots on Monday in a close election primed to be a showdown between the long-dominant Liberals and a center-right party as immigration plays out as a key issue.
The question of how many outsiders should be let into the majority French-speaking province - the second most populous in Canada - has eclipsed arguments over separatism that dominated Quebec in recent decades.
Recent polls show Quebec's ruling Liberals, a centrist party, are running neck-and-neck against the center-right Coalition Avenir Quebec (CAQ) of former business executive Francois Legault, which has never held power.
A CAQ win would follow a shift to the right in Ontario, where Premier Doug Ford's Progressive Conservative government swept to power in June, ending 15 years of Liberal rule in Canada's most populous province, which includes Toronto.
That would also pose a challenge to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's hopes of winning re-election in October 2019, as the federal Liberals are betting on gains in Quebec to offset expected losses elsewhere then.
Last year Legault criticized the Trudeau government for not doing enough to prevent migrants crossing illegally into Quebec and Ontario from the United States.
While the two business-friendly front runners have garnered around 30 percent of the vote each in recent polls, the CAQ is expected to win more seats because it has greater support among francophone voters who are key to winning elections.
Legault has campaigned on a controversial plan to take in 10,000 fewer immigrants a year and expel new residents who fail to pass tests on French and Quebec values within three years.
He came under fire during the campaign after federal officials, who have the final say over who is allowed into Canada, dismissed the plan as unworkable. 
The Quebec Liberals, led by premier Philippe Couillard, have been in power for 13 of the last 15 years and the CAQ is running on a platform of change.
""The question is: Have we had enough of the Liberals? Is it time for new blood?"" Leger Marketing pollster Christian Bourque said by phone. 
At the same time, the Parti Quebecois, which advocates for Quebec separating from Canada, risks its worst showing as it fends off a challenge from left-leaning Quebec Solidaire, pollsters say.
Near-record low unemployment and real growth in gross domestic product in 2017 that broke 3 percent for the first time since 2000 should help Couillard, said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.

Kavcic and Laurentian Bank economist Dominique Lapointe said Monday night's results are unlikely to change Quebec's current investor-friendly strategy of balancing budgets and paying down debt.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A Swedish court on Monday found a man at the center of a scandal that has rocked the academy that awards the Nobel literature prize guilty of rape and sentenced him to two years in jail.
The crisis over the charges against Jean-Claude Arnault prompted some members of the Swedish Academy to quit and forced it to cancel this year's literature prize, which would have been announced this month.
It is the biggest scandal to hit the Academy since a Swedish king founded it more than 200 years ago. 
Arnault, 72, pleaded not guilty to two counts of rape in a district court in Stockholm. The court acquitted him of one. 
His lawyer, Bjorn Hurtig, was not immediately available for comment. Arnault is married to a member of the Swedish Academy and has worked as a professional photographer and artistic director.
Arnault has also said he is not the source of leaks of the names of some past winners.
With Academy members down to only 10 and statutes saying 12 are needed to vote in new members, previous Permanent Secretary Sara Danius and two other members who have effectively left, have said they are willing to take part in important votes such as filling vacant seats.
The Nobel Foundation could drop the Swedish Academy from awarding its prestigious literature prize if the Academy does not make further changes in the wake of the sex scandal, the head of the foundation told Reuters on Friday.

The verdict coincides with this year's Nobel Prize announcements.

Tehran has accused U.S.-backed Gulf Arab states of carrying out the Sept. 22 shooting attack on a military parade that killed 25 people, nearly half of them members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards.
Monday's strike targeted the bases of ""takfiri terrorists"" backed by the United States and regional powers in eastern Syria, the Guards said in a statement on Sepah News, their official news site. It killed a number of militant leaders and destroyed their supplies and infrastructure, they said.
Iranian officials often use the word ""takfiri"" to describe Sunni Muslim hardliners. Iran is predominantly Shi'ite Muslim.
""Death to the family of Saud,"" ""Death to America,"" and ""Death to Israel"" were written on one of the missiles shown on the Fars News site.
The strike targeted the last pocket of territory in southeastern Syria held by Islamic State, said an official in the Iran-backed regional alliance fighting in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
It is an area where the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) launched a new offensive last month against Islamic State. 
The U.S.-led coalition confirmed Iranian forces had conducted ""no notice strikes last night"".
""At this time, the coalition is still assessing if any damage occurred and no coalition forces were in danger,"" Col. spokesman Sean Ryan said.
""IRON FIST""
Fars News posted video footage of several missiles streaking into a dark sky during the attack.
The six ballistic missiles used in the attack flew 570 km (354 miles) to hit the targets, the Guards said. A map shown on state TV pinpointed Kermanshah in western Iran as the launch site and Albu Kamal in southeast Syria as the target.
The missiles were Iranian-made Zolfaqar and Qiam missiles, Fars News reported. 
""Our iron fist is prepared to deliver a decisive and crushing response to any wickedness and mischief of the enemies,"" the Guards, the most powerful military force in the Islamic Republic, said in their statement.
Seven drones were also used to bomb militant targets during the attack, they said. 
The Ahvaz National Resistance, an Iranian ethnic Arab separatist movement, and the Islamic State have both claimed responsibility for the Sept. 22 attack. Neither group has presented conclusive evidence to back up their claim.
Iranian military support has been vital to helping Assad through the Syrian war, and Iran-backed forces are deployed in southeastern Syria on the west bank of the Euphrates River. Iran has dismissed U.S. demands that it leave Syria.
The official in the Iran-backed alliance described Monday's strike, targeting an area on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, as a ""limited message"". ""One of the messages, to those it concerns, is that 'our missiles are one of our powerful cards that are ready to respond whenever we want',"" the official said. 
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, has said the militants responsible for the Sept 22 attack were paid by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and that Iran would ""severely punish"" those behind the violence.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE have denied involvement in the attack.
Mohsen Rezaie, a former commander of the Guards, suggested in a Twitter message on Monday that more attacks were coming.
""The main punishment is on the way,"" Rezaie, who is secretary of the Expediency Council, an unelected arbitration body that resolves disputes between parliament and a clerical vetting body, the Guardian Council, wrote.
Last year, the Guards fired missiles at Islamic State militants in Syria after the group claimed responsibility for an attack on the parliament in Tehran and the mausoleum of the founder of Iran’s revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, that left at least 18 people dead and dozens wounded.

It was not clear who was responsible for the blast but Somalia's Islamist group al Shabaab frequently carries out attacks in the Horn of Africa country.

Some 100 policemen backed by special commando units detained the six suspects aged 28 to 30, acting on warrants issued by the Federal Court of Justice on Sept. 28, the prosecutor said. 
The men are accused of forming ""Revolution Chemnitz"", an organization named after the city where the fatal stabbing of a German man blamed on migrants in August prompted the worst far-right violence in Germany in decades.
""Based on the information we have so far, the suspects belong to the hooligan, skinhead and neo-Nazi scene in the area of Chemnitz and considered themselves leading figures in the right-wing extremist scene in Saxony,"" prosecutors said.
The group had planned to attack senior civil servants and politicians, they said. The men were arrested in the state of Saxony, where Chemnitz lies, and the southern region of Bavaria.
""In the course of further investigations we encountered tangible indications that the organization pursued terrorist goals.""
The far-right violence in Chemnitz, where skinheads hounded migrants and performed the illegal Hitler salute in August, exposed deep divisions over Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision in 2015 to welcome almost one million, mostly Muslim asylum seekers.
The events in the eastern city also strained Merkel's coalition government.
Her conservatives and their Social Democrat (SPD) junior coalition partners could not agree what to do with the head of the BfV domestic spy agency, who questioned the authenticity of a video showing skinheads chasing migrants and was accused of harboring far-right views.
The partners last month reached a compromise to transfer BfV chief Hans Georg Maassen to the interior ministry, ending a row that almost felled their six-month-old government.
A seventh suspect, believed to be the leader of the group, was detained on Sept. 14 on charges of threatening public peace.
The GBA did not say whether his arrest had led to uncovering the organization and its other members.
All seven members of the ""criminal organization"" will appear before a judge who will decide whether to keep them in remand.

NEW YORK(Reuters) - By law, the United States government is responsible for conducting a census every 10 years to count all of the country's residents. But in the lead-up to the 2020 census, state and local leaders have made it clear they will not rely on the federal government to ensure an accurate count.
State governments, foundations and local governments are committing hundreds of millions of dollars to convince people to fill out their census forms, in what is likely to be the most expensive grassroots census campaign ever.
The stakes are high: Population data collected in the census not only serves to allocate congressional seats; it also determines how the federal government divides an estimated $800 billion each year for such things as public housing, highway construction, Head Start, Medicaid and Medicare. An undercount could cost states billions of dollars in federal revenue. 
Some of the groups most likely to receive federal aid are also among those most often missed by the census. The Census Bureau's own analysis found that it undercounted young children by 4.6 percent in the 2010 census and missed 1.1 percent of renters (a category sometimes used as a proxy for low-income residents). Homeowners were over-enumerated by more than half-a-percent. 
    States with large immigrant populations are particularly worried for 2020. They say they have seen widespread distrust of government among immigrants because of heightened immigration enforcement. And for the first time in 70 years, the Census Bureau intends to ask all people whether they are U.S. citizens, a question many worry will further suppress immigrant participation. More than two dozen states and cities are suing to get the question removed. 
California has said it will spend $100 million on outreach, dwarfing the $2 million it spent on the 2010 census, when the state had a severe budget crisis, and the $25 million it spent in 2000. Salt Lake City has budgeted $80,000 to hire its first-ever census director. New York City has allocated $4.3 million, the first time it has formally budgeted for census outreach. 
In addition to state and local governments, some 74 grant-makers nationwide have committed $30 million to census efforts.
Even so, government and nonprofit leaders across the country expressed doubt in interviews that money alone will be enough to coax wary populations to raise their hands.
“Certain communities,” said New York City Deputy Mayor J. Phillip Thompson, “may just be too frightened to participate.”
'IT'S A TRICK'
The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials has been running focus groups to identify effective ways of maximizing census participation. The group's chief executive, Arturo Vargas, said the citizenship question raised alarm bells in focus groups conducted with immigrants, and that participants said they had little confidence their data would be kept private.
They also worried about completing census forms online, another innovation of this year's census. “My mom is 61 years old and she’s not going to go on the computer,” said one focus group respondent. “She’ll think it’s a trick.”
NALEO’s research found that immigrants responded positively to messaging that cited their legal obligation to complete the census. Younger Latino men responded well to ads portraying the census as a way to defend their communities.
Traditional messaging emphasizing civic responsibility “ain’t gonna work,” said Allan Oliver, of the Santa Fe, N.M.-based Thornburg Foundation.
Many state and local officials expressed concern that the citizenship question in particular would depress participation. “Citizenship might be relevant to the federal government, but for those of us who run local governments, we have to treat the sewage,” said Westchester County Executive George Latimer, whose county has appointed an advisory board to help boost participation. “I don’t know if it’s generated by a citizen or not.” 
Los Angeles Census Director Maria de la Luz Garcia said the city's efforts have focused on practical concerns, including planning for computers at local libraries to perform double duty as kiosks for filling out census forms and preparing to include census reminders in city utility bills. 
The bureau has said it can conduct the 2020 census more cheaply because, with online responses, it will be able to hire fewer enumerators than in 2010 and open fewer field offices. 
But some local government officials say their constituents will need human contact and encouragement in this census more than ever.
Every person not counted will ultimately cost his or her state $19,500 over the next decade, a study by George Washington University’s Andrew Reamer estimated. California, for example, lost out on at least $1.5 billion of aid due to uncounted residents after the 2000 census, a PricewaterhouseCoopers study found.
FUNDERS CIRCLE 
Philanthropic groups in 21 states so far have formed state-level census outreach efforts, in many cases for the first time. 
In rural New Mexico, where getting an accurate count has always been difficult, a group led by the Thornburg Foundation and the Albuquerque Community Foundation are aiming to raise $600,000. In Minnesota, which has the nation's largest Somali population, foundations have designed a $4.8 million campaign, asking Minnesota’s government to chip in $1.25 million.
The foundation-led New York Counts 2020 coalition plans to raise $3 million, and is urging the state's government to pony up much more, citing California's example. 
Ditas Katague, who oversees census outreach for California, said that even with the state's $100 million campaign, the task is difficult.

“We’re way ahead of where we were in 2000 and 2010,” Katague said. “But the feeling is that we’re behind.”

SEOUL (Reuters) - Troops from North and South Korea began removing some landmines along their heavily fortified border on Monday, the South's defense ministry said, in a pact to reduce tension and build trust on the divided peninsula.
Project details were agreed during last month's summit in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, between its leader, Kim Jong Un, and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.
In a statement, the ministry said the two sides agreed to remove all landmines in the so-called Joint Security Area (JSA) in Panmunjom within the next 20 days, with military engineers performing the hazardous task on the South Korean side.
There was no immediate confirmation from North Korea that its troops had begun the process.
The deal also provides for removal of guard posts and weapons from the JSA to follow the removal of the mines, with the troops remaining there to be left unarmed.
The JSA is the only spot along the 250-km (155-mile) -long ""demilitarized zone"" (DMZ) where troops from both Koreas are face to face.
South Korean troops have gradually taken over most operations along their side of the border but international forces under the U.S.-led United Nations Command retain major roles, especially at the JSA, where an American commander and a South Korean deputy lead the security battalion.
UNC spokesman Colonel Chad Carroll declined to confirm if the command would also withdraw any weapons from the JSA, but said American forces would provide support for the demining operation.
""United States Forces Korea will perform a support role - to include having air medical evacuation assets available to respond within minutes of any potential medical emergencies,"" he told Reuters in a statement.
Since fighting during the 1950-1953 Korean War ended in a stalemate, at least nine soldiers have been killed in incidents with North Korean troops, including the killing in 1976 of two U.S. soldiers by axe-wielding North Koreans, the UNC says.
In November 2017, North Korean troops at the JSA shot one of their soldiers defecting to the South five times. 
More recently, it was the scene of the first dramatic April summit between Kim and Moon, as well as their second, more low-key meeting, in May.
In April, the neighbors announced their intention to turn the DMZ - long a symbol of tension and division - into a ""peace zone"".
They have already dismantled propaganda loudspeakers and some guard posts along the border.
Demining projects are also set to begin on Monday in Gangwon province in South Korea's east, to allow teams to search for the remains of soldiers killed in the war, the ministry added. 
More than a million landmines were laid in border areas including the DMZ and the Civilian Control Zone in the South, say demining experts, and civilians and soldiers alike have been killed or injured by them. 

In 2015, two South Korean soldiers were maimed by what Seoul said was a North Korean landmine, an accusation the North denied.

BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - British finance minister Philip Hammond said on Monday the United Kingdom had the fiscal capacity to cope with leaving the European Union without any agreement but believed the mood in Brussels was to reach a divorce deal.
Britain's exit from the European Union next March has increased uncertainty for employers, with talks about the future relationship between the world's fifth largest economy and its largest trading partner becoming increasingly fraught.
""I'm clear that we will have the fiscal capacity to support the British economy if we were unfortunately to find ourselves in a no-deal situation,"" he told Sky News.
However, Hammond said the doubts about the future had already hit the economy and the next few weeks would be crucial in securing an agreement with the EU.
""The mood is undoubtedly that people want to do a deal with the UK. People want to minimize the disruption of the UK's departure from the European Union, they want to continue having a relationship with us and smooth trading partnership in the future,"" he told BBC TV.
""Clearly there has been a hit to the economy through the uncertainty the Brexit process has caused. Many businesses are sitting on their hands frankly waiting to see what the outcome of this negotiation is before confirming their investment plans.""
Reassuring businesses they remain at the heart of the center-right Conservatives Party's plan for the economy will be the focus of Hammond's speech to his party's conference on Monday.
The business community has expressed frustration over the government's lack of clarity during the Brexit process and what some see as a decision to put ideology before the economy. 
""We back business, as the cornerstone of a successful economy, as a force for good in our society, and as an essential expression of our values,"" Hammond will say in his speech to the Conservative Party's annual conference in Birmingham.
The British Chambers of Commerce said it wanted the Conservatives to overcome their internal divisions and ""to deliver real-world, practical answers to business’s ongoing questions around Brexit – and avoid a messy and disorderly exit from the EU.""
FOUL LANGUAGE
Relations suffered earlier this year when then-foreign minister Boris Johnson was quoted dismissing business leaders' concerns about Brexit, using foul language, in a meeting with EU diplomats.
Johnson, the bookmakers' favorite to succeed May, has become a cheerleader for hardline Brexit supporters in the Conservative Party who have denounced her so-called ""Chequers"" proposals and has put forward his own plans for an alternative free trade deal.
Hammond said Johnson's idea was not on offer from the EU.
""What Chequers does is offer an in-the-middle solution, down the center, taking the best from both models, and proposing a way forward which delivers on the mandate of the British people in the referendum but also protects British jobs and British businesses,"" he told Sky News.
Last week, Britain's opposition Labour Party sought to woo business bosses even as it unveiled a raft of radical economic policies, saying the Conservatives had given them the opportunity to pitch an alternative leftist strategy. 
Despite Brexit dominating political discussions, polls suggest it lags behind the state-run National Health Service as Britons' greatest concern and Hammond said people would have to pay more in tax to fund extra investment.

""The prime minister was very clear and very honest with the public that if we want in the future a growing NHS to support our aging population of course we'll have to accept a little more tax to fund that service,"" he said.

The official, who is involved in China policy and spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was not clear if or when the meeting would be rescheduled.
The cancellation was first reported by the New York Times.
The official said it was not clear whether the cancellation was because of the broad range of disputes between Beijing and Washington on issues such as arms sales and military activity in the South China Sea and other waters around China.
China and the United States are also locked in a spiraling trade war that has seen them level increasingly severe rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.
""The tension is escalating, and that could prove to be dangerous to both sides,"" the official said.
The U.S. State Department declined comment. Officials at the White House and Department of Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China's Foreign and Defense Ministries also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sources in Beijing briefed on the matter said last week the security meeting may not take place because of the tensions in relations between the two countries.
The Chinese government's top diplomat, Wang Yi, said on Friday there was ""no cause for panic"" over friction between Beijing and Washington, but warned that China would not be blackmailed or yield to pressure over trade.

In his latest newspaper column, Johnson did not mention Brexit and instead said Britain's aid budget should be shifted to projects ""consistent with the political and commercial priorities of this country.""
""Everywhere you go, you will find other countries that subtly or openly use their development aid budgets as leverage to support their exports, or other popular objectives,"" Johnson said.
""It was infuriating to travel to South East Asia, and see for instance how Japanese contractors were supported by development assistance, as they applied for contracts, in ways we deem to be illegal.""
Britain has an aid budget at 0.7 percent of economic output and the target has previously come under fire from lawmakers who say it is a blunt tool that is too high and should be spent in Britain itself.

""If we are going to spend so much on aid – and there is no doubt that it wins Britain friends and admirers around the world – then let's get value for this country as well,"" Johnson said.

MALE (Reuters) - The Maldives High Court granted former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom bail on Sunday, making him the latest jailed opponent of President Abdulla Yameen to win freedom since Yameen lost a re-election bid a week ago. 
The High Court granted Gayoom bail of 60,000 Maldivian rufiyaa ($3,891) after a secret hearing. Gayoom, who ruled Maldives from 1978-2008, is awaiting trial on charges of trying to bribe officials to topple his the government of Yameen, his own estranged half brother. He was separately sentenced in June to 19 months imprisonment on obstruction of justice charges for refusing to hand over his mobile phone during the investigation.
In the run-up to last week's election, Yameen's government imprisoned a raft of his critics including two former presidents, two Supreme Court judges, two vice presidents, two defense ministers, a number of opposition leaders, lawmakers, and a former chief prosecutor.
Yameen lost his re-election bid to opposition leader Ibrahim Mohamed Solih by more than 16 percentage points. Although Yameen is due to remain in office until Nov. 17 before Solih assumes the presidency, a number of Yameen's opponents have already been freed. 
On Sunday, the High Court also granted bail to two legislators, Gayoom's son Faris Maumoon and tourism tycoon Gasim Ibrahim, who leads a political party.
The country of 400,000 people is popular with tourists but has seen political unrest since its first democratically elected leader, Mohamed Nasheed, was forced to quit amid a police mutiny in 2012.

KUWAIT (Reuters) - Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman arrived in Kuwait on Sunday, state media reported, amid expectation that he will discuss oil supplies and a Kuwaiti mediation effort to resolve Saudi Arabia's conflict with Qatar.
Prince Mohammed will hold talks with Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, state news agency KUNA reported. 
The Saudi prince is expected to discuss the resumption of oil output from a neutral zone which Saudi Arabia shares with Kuwait, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
He will be accompanied by Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih during his trip to Kuwait, two separate sources said.
A Gulf Arab official told Reuters earlier that the dispute with Qatar would also be on the agenda.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have imposed sanctions on Qatar accusing it of cosying up to Iran - their regional arch rival - and supporting terrorism.

Doha denies the accusations. Kuwaiti mediation efforts have failed so far to end the dispute.

(Reuters) - Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Sunday denied that his country was responsible for increased threats against a U.S. consulate in the Iraqi city of Basra. 
""We of course have influence in Iraq but that does not mean we control people in Iraq, as the United States doesn't control people in countries with whom it has good relations,"" Zarif said on CNN's “Fareed Zakaria GPS.""
Zarif added that recent warnings issued to the Iranian government by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House national security adviser John Bolton were counterproductive. 
""Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Bolton, instead of making these irrelevant threats that would produce no positive results, need to look at their own policies,” Zarif said. 
The United States announced on Friday it will effectively close the consulate following increasing threats from Iran and Iran-backed militia, including rocket fire. 
Pompeo, as he explained the move, renewed a warning that the United States would hold Iran directly responsible for any attacks on Americans and U.S. diplomatic facilities.
“I have made clear that Iran should understand that the United States will respond promptly and appropriately to any such attacks,” Pompeo said in a statement.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said on Saturday that the consulate closure was “unjustified and unnecessary”, and said Iran condemned any attack on diplomats or diplomatic locations, according to the ministry’s website.

Gaza health officials said Israeli soldiers on Friday shot dead seven Palestinians, who were among thousands who thronged to the fortified border as part of weekly protests launched six months ago. Mosabeh was one of those killed.
""I cried for him like I have never cried before. I do not know what the (Israeli) occupation saw in him to kill him? What did he do to them? Did he kill anybody? I do not know what happened,"" Mosabeh's friend, Dia' Abu Khater said.
Mosabeh's classmates in the school in the southern Gaza Strip decorated his chair with his picture ringed by red and white flowers and green leaves, the Palestinian colors.
Mosabeh was always at the border to assist medics in the Friday protests, his sister, Eslam, said.
""Nassir always came with us. Everyone in the field hospital knows him and he always helped us. Nassir was our right hand, he would always bring us equipment whenever we needed something. May God bless his soul,"" she said. 
Israel said it held Islamist group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, responsible for the violence.
""Hamas continues to orchestrate belligerent activity throughout the Gaza Strip, cynically using Gazan civilians and endangering children by sending them to the security fence as a cover for terror activity,"" the Israeli military said in a statement that summarized Friday's events.
""Hamas is responsible for the violent riots and their consequences,"" the statement added.
Israel said troops resorted to live fire and an air strike after explosive devices and rocks were thrown at them and to prevent breaches of the border fence. It posted a video clip showing a controlled detonation of many explosive devices.
Gaza health officials said 505 people were wounded on Friday, 89 of them by gunshots.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed since the Gaza protests began on March 30. The protesters are demanding the right of return to lands that Palestinian families fled or were driven from on Israel's founding in 1948, and the easing of an Israeli-Egyptian economic blockade.
Two million Palestinians, mainly stateless descendants of people who left what is now Israel 70 years ago, live in the Gaza Strip, which has been controlled by Hamas for more than a decade, during which it has fought three wars against Israel.

Israel and Egypt say the blockade is necessary for security reasons. The World Bank says it has reduced the territory's economy to a state of collapse, with residents suffering a lack of clean water, electricity and health care.

The migrants were rescued from two small boats off the coast of Libya at least a week ago. They include Libyans, Syrians, Palestinians, Somalis and Pakistanis. Among them are seven families and three children under five years of age.
The Aquarius spent five days off the coast of Malta waiting for the weather to improve so it could transfer the migrants to a Maltese cutter. 
Panama withdrew the Aquarius' registration amid the rescue operations, which means the ship will not legally be allowed to sail once it comes to shore until it sorts out its flag status. The Aquarius was the last charity rescue ship operating off of Libya. Last year there were five groups running rescue ships.
Among the migrants was a small, white dog, who was rescued along with her Libyan family. She was brought ashore in a carrier box and will be quarantined and examined before being returned to her family.
At a political event, Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said, referring to the dog, that his country cares about saving ""all lives"". 
France, Portugal, Spain and Germany struck a deal on Tuesday to take in the migrants who disembarked in Malta after Italy refused to let the vessel dock.
Some 650,000 people have reached Italian shores from North Africa since 2014, and Rome's populist government, which took office in June, has begun to take a rigidly anti-immigration line, saying it will not let any more rescue ships dock unless other EU states agree to take the people in.
""The Government of Malta has participated in this effort on purely humanitarian grounds,"" a Maltese government statement said. ""The MV Aquarius has been deflagged and is expected to proceed to a port in France to rectify its stateless position.""
The United Nations' refugee agency on Sunday thanked the countries involved in resolving the latest of several standoffs involving rescue ships and EU countries, all of which have arisen from Italy's shutting of its ports.
""We are talking about people's lives. Refugees and migrants cannot be continually put at risk while States argue over their responsibilities,"" the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said in a statement.

Badie has been handed multiple death sentences and life prison terms in a series of trials since Egypt's military ousted President Mohamed Mursi, also of the Brotherhood, in July 2013.
According to MENA, the retrial relates to a case in which Badie and 14 others were handed life sentences for incitement to commit murder and attempted murder of anti-Muslim Brotherhood demonstrators near the group's headquarters in June 2013. Four others were sentenced to death in the February 2015 ruling.
The new charges for senior figures include ""participating in the incitement and assistance in beating of protesters"", while two other defendants were charged with causing deaths or disfigurement and possession of weapons, MENA reported. It did not explain why the charges were modified but according to Egyptian law charges can be altered if new evidence arises.
The retrial ordered by the Cairo Criminal Court affects only those in custody and not those defendants who were tried in absentia.

296,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",Bangladesh to consider amending law seen curbing free speech,"By Serajul Quadir
DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh will consider making changes to a proposed law that journalists and countries such as the United States say could suppress free speech, a government minister said on Sunday after a meeting with a group of editors.
The South Asian nation's parliament passed the Digital Security Act on Sept. 19, combining the colonial-era Official Secrets Act with tough new provisions such as allowing police to arrest individuals without a warrant.
It would have come into force with the signature of President Abdul Hamid ahead of a general election expected in December. 
But Anisul Huq, Bangladesh's law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister, said the concerns will be raised in Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's cabinet. He did not say when that could happen.
""We had a detailed discussion with representatives of the Editors' Council and took serious note of their concerns,"" Huq told Reuters.
""We assured them that if the cabinet agrees, then we may make some amendments. We will also take some measures to make (some of the contentious) sections clear that those will not target the journalist community or silence their voices to reveal the truth.""
The government will again meet with the journalists once the matter is taken up in cabinet, Huq said.
Matiur Rahman Chowdhury, who attended the meeting in his capacity as editor of the Bangla daily Manab Zamin, said: ""It's a rare instance that after passing a law in parliament the cabinet has agreed to sit again to discuss that.
""For now, we are not going to hold any protest or movement as the minister has promised to do something positive. We will wait until that cabinet decision.""
U.S. CONCERN
The proposed law stipulates a maximum jail sentence of 14 years for espionage if an individual is found secretly recording information with electronic instruments inside a government building or for spreading ""propaganda"" against Bangladesh's 1971 war for independence from Pakistan.
A further element journalists have opposed is the inclusion of the colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which includes a 14-year sentence for sharing state secrets with an enemy.
Since Hasina's election victory in 2009 scores of people, including journalists, have been jailed in Bangladesh for criticizing the government on the internet. A Bangladesh court this month rejected bail for prominent social activist and photographer Shahidul Alam, who was arrested last month for spreading ""propaganda and false information"" during widespread student protests.
The proposed law has also attracted strong criticism internationally.
""The United States shares the concerns of the international community that the recently passed Digital Security Act could be used to suppress and criminalize free speech, all to the detriment of Bangladesh’s democracy, development and prosperity,"" the U.S. ambassador to Bangladesh, Marcia Bernicat, said in a statement on Sunday.
""We encourage the Government of Bangladesh to consider changes to the law that would bring it into conformity with the Bangladesh constitution and with Bangladesh’s international commitments on human, civil and political rights.""
The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, meanwhile, held a public meeting in Dhaka on Sunday, attended by tens of thousands of people, to demand that former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia be released from jail.

Khaleda was jailed in February for five years on what BNP describes as trumped-up corruption charges, an allegation the government denies, citing court independence.

Leaders of Israel's Arab community have called for their private sector to strike against the recently-passed Nation State Law, which declares that only Jews have the right of self-determination in Israel.
The strike will have limited effect on the country as a whole as Monday is a holiday for Israel's Jewish majority as they mark the end of the Sukkot festival. 
Factions in the Palestinian territories have said schools, universities, government offices and shops will close in solidarity.
The law has come under fierce criticism at home and abroad and has provoked anger among the 1.8 million Palestinian Arabs who make up a fifth of Israel's 9 million citizens. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hastily set up a committee to propose new legislation to mollify the law's critics but no amendments have been enacted since the its passage in July shortly before Parliament went on its summer recess. It will reconvene in the middle of October.
Mohammed Barakeh, a former Israeli lawmaker who heads a committee that monitors Israeli policy concerning Israel's Arabs, said the strike had been called in coordination with groups in the Palestinian territories.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Danny Tamaki, the son of a U.S. Marine and Japanese mother, was elected governor of Japan's Okinawa island on Sunday on an anti-U.S military presence platform, defeating a candidate backed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling bloc, domestic media reported.
Tamaki defeated Atsushi Sakima who ran with the support of Abe's Liberal Democratic Party and its junior coalition partner, NHK and Kyodo news agency said.
Public broadcaster NHK showed a jubilant Tamaki and his supporters cheering and dancing after news of his victory.
A former radio personality who went into local politics and was elected to parliament in 2009, Tamaki, 58, opposes the planned relocation of the U.S. Marines' Futenma air base within Okinawa. His stance is the same as his predecessor, Takeshi Onaga, who died of pancreatic cancer last month while in office. 
Tokyo's central government and Okinawa authorities have long been at loggerheads over the plan to move the air base.
A U.S.-Japan agreement calls for moving the base, which is surrounded by schools, hospitals and shops, to a less populated area, called Henoko, on the northern part of Okinawa.
But many Okinawa residents, indignant at what they see as an unfair burden for supporting the bulk of U.S military forces in Japan, want the base off the island altogether. 
The victory of Tamaki follows soul searching in Japan about what it means to be Japanese after Naomi Osaka, 20, won the U.S. Open tennis title, the first Grand Slam win by a Japan-born tennis player. Osaka is the daughter of a Haitian-born father and Japanese mother and has dual Japanese and U.S. citizenship. 
Sakima's defeat is a headache for Abe, as the Okinawa vote was the first high-profile election after he won an LDP leadership election this month, putting himself on track to become Japan's longest-serving premier.
Senior politicians from the ruling bloc had visited Okinawa over the past few weeks to throw their weight behind Sakima, underlining the significance of the outcome of the election.
Sakima had focused on economic policies to spur Okinawa's growth for Japan's poorest prefecture during his campaign. 
Delays in relocating the U.S. base have been an irritant in Japan's relations with ally the United States at a time when Tokyo faces China's growing military power.

300,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2018 09:13AM ET</span>","'Let's come together,' PM May challenges Brexit critics","By Elizabeth Piper, Kylie MacLellan and William James
BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May called on her party on Sunday to unite behind her plan to leave the European Union, making a direct appeal to critics by saying their desire for a free trade deal was at the heart of her Brexit proposals.
At the start of what is set to be one of the Conservative Party's stormiest annual conferences, May's plans were once again attacked by two former ministers, with former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, calling them ""deranged"". 
Just six months before Britain is due to leave the EU in the country's biggest shift in foreign and trade policy in more than 40 years, the debate over how to leave the bloc is still raging in the center-right Conservative Party, and even in government.
May's already fragile leadership was put under further pressure this month when the EU rejected parts of the so-called Chequers plan. But she put a positive spin on those talks, saying she was ready to consider the EU's concerns. 
""My message to my party is let's come together and get the best deal for Britain,"" May told the BBC in the central English city of Birmingham.
""At the heart of the Chequers plan is a free trade deal, a free trade area and frictionless trade ... Chequers at the moment is the only plan on the table that delivers on the Brexit vote ... and also delivers for the people of Northern Ireland.""
May has shown little sign of shifting away from her Chequers plan, named after her country residence where she hashed out an agreement on Brexit with her ministers in July, despite growing criticism that her proposals offer the worst of all worlds.
Johnson, who quit May's cabinet after Chequers was agreed, called her plans ""deranged"" and attacked the prime minister for not believing in Brexit. 
He, and the former Brexit minister David Davis, are pushing for a Canada-style free trade deal with the EU - a proposal May says will split Northern Ireland from mainland Britain by making the British province adhere to different customs rules.
Greg Clark, May's business minister, said such a trade deal would also hurt businesses by clogging up international supply chains that are crucial to companies, such as car manufacturers.
BELIEVER
But Johnson was unrepentant, keen to portray himself as the defender of a clean break with the EU.
""Unlike the prime minister I fought for this, I believe in it, I think it's the right thing for our country and I think that what is happening now is, alas, not what people were promised in 2016,"" Johnson, the bookmakers' favorite to succeed May, told the Sunday Times newspaper. 
Davis, who like Johnson resigned in protest said her plan was ""just wrong"", but he added he thought it was 80-90 percent likely that the government would strike an exit deal with the EU.
May's team had hoped the party's conference would give her a platform to renew her pledge to help those people who are ""just about managing"", trying to pull the focus away from Brexit and on to a domestic agenda.
But her first announcement - for an additional levy on foreign home buyers - did little to reset the conversation, with Sunday dominated again with Brexit, a possible leadership campaign and the prospect of an early election.
A report by a research group suggested Britain's decision to leave the EU has cost the government 500 million pounds ($650 million) a week, wiping out for the moment any future savings from stopping payments to the bloc.
Ian Lavery, chairman of the opposition Labour Party, said the Conservatives were ""clearly too busy fighting amongst themselves and have neither the ideas nor the desire to offer real solutions to the problems they have caused"".
Johnson's interview in the Sunday Times was seen by many in the party to be the start of a campaign to unseat May - something that angered some Conservatives who are critical of the former foreign minister.
May refused to be drawn on his comments, and did not refer to him by name in a lengthy interview with the BBC. But her response was sharp. 
""I do believe in Brexit,"" she said. 

""But crucially I believe in delivering Brexit in a way that respects the vote and delivers on the vote of the British people while also protecting our union, protecting jobs and ensuring that we make a success of Brexit for the future.""

A judiciary official also warned truck drivers holding a nationwide strike over pay and high prices of ""harsh penalties"" if they continue their protests, state media said. 
The special Islamic revolutionary courts were set up last month to try suspects quickly after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called for ""swift and just"" legal action to confront an ""economic war"" by foreign enemies.
Judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, quoted by state TV, said the courts handed down out death sentences to three defendants after convicting them of ""spreading corruption on earth"", a capital offence under Iran's Islamic laws.
Mohseni Ejei did not name the three but said the sentences would have to be upheld by the supreme court before being carried out, the TV reported.
Iranian officials have accused arch-foes the United States and Israel, as well as regional rival Saudi Arabia and government opponents living in exile of fomenting unrest and waging an economic war to destabilize Iran.
Mohseni Ejei said 32 other defendants were sentenced to jail terms of up to 20 years for economic crimes, the official news agency IRNA reported.
In May the United States pulled out of a 2015 deal between world powers and Tehran under which international sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for curbs on its nuclear program.
Washington has reimposed a number of sanctions on Iran, and it is planning to impose heavier sanctions in November aimed at the Islamic Republic's oil sector.
The rial currency has lost about 70 percent of its value since April under the threat of revived U.S. sanctions, with heavy demand for dollars among ordinary Iranians trying to protect their savings.
The cost of living has also soared, sparking sporadic demonstrations against profiteering and corruption, with many protesters chanting anti-government slogans.
Mohseni Ejei warned truck drivers who have continued their protests for higher wages and affordable parts despite several rounds of arrest.
""Harsh penalties await those who ... block lorry traffic on roads,"" he said according to IRNA.
General prosecutor Mohammad Jafar Montazeri said last week that protesting drivers may face death sentences under stern laws against highway robbery, the state broadcaster IRIB reported on Thursday.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's biggest selling newspaper - after accusing China of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has seen them level rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, ""is now doubling down on that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press.""
""In disseminating its propaganda, China's government is availing itself of America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,"" Branstad wrote.
""In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's troubling economic trajectory, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,"" he wrote.

He added that ""one of China's most prominent newspapers dodged the offer to publish"" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Navy destroyer sailed near islands claimed by China in the South China Sea on Sunday, a U.S. official told Reuters, potentially angering Beijing at a time of tense relations between the two countries.
Beijing and Washington are locked in a trade war that has seen them impose increasingly severe rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the destroyer Decatur traveled within 12 nautical miles of Gaven and Johnson Reefs in the Spratly Islands. 
The operation was the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing’s efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters, where Chinese, Japanese and some Southeast Asian navies operate.
China’s claims in the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes each year, are contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.
""We conduct routine and regular freedom-of-navigation operations, as we have done in the past and will continue to do in the future,"" the U.S. official added.
China's foreign ministry did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
The United States has criticized China’s construction of islands and military facilities in the area and is concerned they could be used to restrict free nautical movement.
The U.S. military has a long-standing position that its operations are carried out throughout the world, including in areas claimed by allies, and are separate from political considerations.
The latest move comes at a particularly tense time in relations between the United States and China. 
Friction between the world's two biggest economies is now moving beyond trade, with U.S. President Donald Trump accusing Beijing this week of seeking to interfere in congressional elections, marking a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
China recently denied a request for a U.S. warship to visit Hong Kong and this month Beijing postponed joint military talks in protest against a U.S. decision to impose sanctions on a Chinese military agency and its director for buying Russian fighter jets and a surface-to-air missile system.

In May two U.S. Navy warships sailed near South China Sea islands claimed by China.

Raqqa served as the de facto capital of Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliphate until it was retaken by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia alliance last October.
A spokesman for the Raqqa Internal Security Forces set up by the SDF said it had killed two members of an Islamic State cell and detained five others during an operation on Saturday. 
""Special forces and explosives experts carried out a counter operation .. to confront plans which were about to be executed by a terrorist cell affiliated with mercenaries of Daesh in a neighborhood in Raqqa city,"" the unit's spokesman Mohannad Ibrahim said at a news conference. 
Daesh is an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.
The forces raided two residential apartments where the cell members were hiding and confiscated grenades, pistols and explosives, the spokesman said.
They also found a car bomb at the site of the operation and unearthed a large cache of arms and land mines buried nearby. 
The city has witnessed lately a wave of road side bombings targeting mainly SDF officials and fighters.
In June, SDF imposed a three-day curfew in Raqqa and declared a state of emergency saying Islamic State militants had infiltrated the city and planned a bombing campaign.

305,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>",Vatican deal with Beijing leaves some key questions unresolved,"By Greg Torode and Philip Pullella
HONG KONG/VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - A landmark deal between China's leaders and the Vatican over the appointment of bishops has been struck without Beijing taking action on long-held Church concerns over clerics in detention, Catholic Church sources familiar with the matter say.
The agreement, which gives the Vatican a long-desired say in the appointment of bishops in China, was signed last Saturday, but details have not been made public.
Three sources aware of the substance of the provisional deal say the plight of a dozen or so detained priests and bishops, some elderly, remains unresolved and will be subject to on-going Vatican efforts. Beijing has provided little clear information about their fate despite repeated Vatican requests in recent years, the sources said.
A senior Vatican source said the precise number still believed to be in detention was not clear. 
Some of those held are feared to have died in detention, according to Catholic priests and activists who monitor the situation on the mainland.
Neither China's Foreign Ministry, which has been leading the talks with the Vatican, nor the Ministry of Public Security immediately responded to requests for comment.
A Vatican spokesman said he had no immediate comment.
The Justice and Peace Commission of the Hong Kong Catholic Diocese issued a statement in June protesting the renewed detention of Bishop Cui Tai from Hebei province in April, urging the release of all ""unreasonably and illegally detained clergy"".
They also highlighted the detention of Baoding Bishop James Su Zhimin. Now 86, Su has been held since his arrest in October, 1997 but no details of his whereabouts or condition are known.
""The reality is this deal is a small step, a very small step...there is much hard work ahead on unresolved issues,"" said one cleric familiar with the pact.
Hong Kong priests say a total figure of clerics under detention or house arrest in China is hard to pin down given official opacity. Beyond long-term detentions, some are held briefly by local authorities.
China's approximately 12 million Catholics have been split between an underground church loyal to the pope and the state-supervised Catholic Patriotic Association.
While some critics have slammed this month's agreement as a betrayal that could finally crush the underground Church, Vatican officials said failure to strike the deal could have led to a fatal schism between Chinese Catholics.
""There are many other points and concrete matters that pertain to the life of the Church that can now be put forward,"" said Father Federico Lombardi, a former papal spokesman who followed the negotiations closely.
""The fact that a positive result has been achieved leaves hope that others can follow, that there can be development,"" he told Italy's Catholic SIR news agency.
ROLE OF BISHOPS
Another issue still to be finalised, according to the same three Catholic sources, is the future roles and responsibilities of some of the seven bishops ordained by Beijing's state-backed church without Vatican approval but legitimized by Pope Francis to clear the way for the deal.
Two of the seven had faced earlier Vatican investigations into allegations they had wives or girlfriends, according to Catholic sources - contravening the vow of celibacy taken by Catholic priests.
They are expected to take up administrative or symbolic roles, keeping the title of bishop without carrying out full responsibilities, including the ordination of priests, the sources said. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm the personal status of these two bishops.
Under the deal, the government will no longer appoint bishops without the approval of the Vatican, which will be given candidates chosen by Catholic communities and Chinese authorities.
But uncertainty is already mounting among some Chinese faithful over how their underground body will integrate with the government-linked Church.
Father Bernardo Cervellera, editor of Rome-based Catholic news agency AsiaNews, said that underground bishops were still restricted. They can say Mass but not move around their dioceses as freely as they wanted.
Missionary priests in contact with underground counterparts in recent days say the pressure on them has intensified in recent months.
""I think of the endurance of the Catholics who suffered. It is true that they will suffer. There is always suffering in an accord, but they have great faith,"" Pope Francis said on Tuesday. He has repeatedly defended the deal, which he said would give him, and not Beijing, the final say.
RESERVATIONS IN HONG KONG
The Bishop of Hong Kong - for decades a vital Catholic beachhead on the edge of officially atheist China - on Saturday expressed his reservations over the pact, saying time and more details were needed before it could be fully judged, or even called an agreement.
Quoted in this weekend's edition of the Sunday Examiner, the city's Catholic newspaper, Bishop Michael Yeung referenced lyrics from the 1970s Swedish pop group ABBA: ""The winner takes it all, the loser's standing small.""
""Catholics in China are neither radicals nor revolutionaries, instead they are really poor people,"" he was quoted as saying. ""It is unfortunate that the Communist government targets the Catholic Church more than any other religious group in China.""
Bishop Yeung, who told the paper he was not yet aware of the content of the accord, did not respond to Reuters' questions.
A Hong Kong-based Vatican envoy was also quoted in the Examiner saying that the deal was of ""great importance"", but more negotiations were needed to ensure more freedom and autonomy for the Church.
""I hope the agreement may also bring more trust between the two parties and will inspire other solutions for the benefit of our Catholic Church in China,"" said Monsignor Ante Jozic, one of only two semi-official Vatican representatives in greater China under Communist Party control.
Jozic confirmed his remarks to Reuters, but said he could not comment further.
Hong Kong is one of the most important Catholic cities in Asia, home to an extensive network of aid agencies, missions, scholars and media that have supported Catholics in China and elsewhere.

While the Vatican instituted similar accords with Communist authorities in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union during the Cold War, the situation in China differs because Beijing created a rival brand of Catholicism through the Patriotic Association.

ERBIL/SULAIMANIYA, Iraq (Reuters) - Kurds voted in a parliamentary election in their semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq on Sunday, with the two dominant parties widely expected to extend their power sharing rule despite growing discontent.
The poll comes a year after the region of six million made a failed bid to break away from the rest of Iraq in a campaign headed by Masoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP). 
Barzani has retained a support base even though his independence drive was crushed by the Baghdad government, and splits within the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) mean the KDP could gain the upper hand in their two-party ruling coalition.
A weak opposition has been unable to challenge the KDP-PUK alliance. Both parties have and have dominated Kurdish politics for decades. 
""I don’t know who I will vote for but our family has always supported the KDP. My son will pick a candidate for me,"" said Halima Ahmed, 65, as she walked with a cane in the city of Erbil, the seat of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG).
The oil-producing region's unsuccessful independence bid, stagnant politics, unpaid public sector salaries and corruption have undermined the population's faith in politics and turnout shrank in recent elections. 
The leading parties say they do not expect more than about 40 percent of the 3.85 million registered voters to go to the polls, which close at 6 p.m. (1500 GMT). Preliminary results are expected within 72 hours.
There are 111-seats up for grabs in Sunday's election, including 11 reserved for ethnic minorities. 
WEAK OPPOSITION 
Kurdish opposition parties did poorly when Iraq held federal elections in May. But multiple allegations that the KDP and PUK had committed election fraud - not confirmed in a subsequent recount - may sway voters in their favor. 
Gorran, the main opposition movement, has been weakened by infighting and the death of its founder and leader Nechirvan Mustafa last year. 
""I wanted to make sure I voted early. I gave my vote to Gorran and hope for the best,"" said Omar Mahmoud Abdullah, 52, at the polling station set up at Shireen School in Sulaimaniya, stronghold of the PUK.
An another polling station in Sulaimaniya, lawyer Hassan Dalloush, 65, also said he was voting for the opposition. 
""If there’s no fraud in this election, I’ll feel good about it. But the parties in power always want to commit fraud, it’s the only way they stay in power,"" he said.
""I will never vote for the parties in power. Today I voted for the opposition."" 
The September 2017 held despite pressure from Baghdad and threats from Turkey and Iran.
The referendum in September 2017 promised to set Iraq’s Kurds on a path to a homeland and nearly 93 percent voted in favor of independence, despite pressure from the central government in Baghdad and threats from neighboring Turkey and Iran. 
A swift backlash from Baghdad, including a military offensive in the region, dashed those prospects. Relations with the central government have improved, but the ordeal cost the Kurdish region territory as well as economic autonomy.
Nevertheless, some voters showed optimism about the future. Salar Karim arrived at a polling station with his wife and two young children, all dressed festively for the occasion. 
""Today is a historic day for Kurds,"" Karim, 50, said. “We get to elect our parliament as is our duty. I feel good about today.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has sent South Korean President Moon Jae-in a pair of white North Korean Pungsan dogs as a gift, the latest sign of a dramatic thaw in relations between the Korean rivals.
Moon and Kim held their third meeting this year in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang in mid-September, when Kim proposed the idea of the canine presents, the South Korean presidential Blue House said in a statement on Sunday.
The dogs passed through the heavily fortified demilitarized zone (DMZ) and the truce village of Panmunjom into South Korea on Thursday.
Kim crossed at the same place to meet Moon for the first time in April this year. 
The breed, named after a North Korean county, is known for its loyalty and skills for hunting, even tigers. It is designated as a North Korean ""natural monument"" animal.
The two will live with South Korea's First Dog, Tori, who became the first shelter dog to take up residence at the South Korean presidential compound.
Moon, who is known to be an animal lover, adopted the black mixed breed Tori in July last year, two months after he took office.
It is not the first time a North Korean leader has sent a pair of Pungsan dogs to a South Korean leader. 
In 2000, late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, father of Kim Jong Un, sent two Pungsan dogs to then-South Korean president Kim Dae-jung when they held the first inter-Korean summit.

Dozens of people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of two hotels and a mall in the city of Palu, which was hit by waves as high as six meters (20 feet) following the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday.
A young woman was pulled alive from the rubble of the city's Roa Roa Hotel, where up to 60 people were believed trapped. Hundreds of people gathered at the wrecked mall searching for loved ones.
With most of the confirmed deaths from Palu, authorities are bracing for much worse as reports filter in from outlying areas, in particular, Donggala, a region of 300,000 people north of Palu and closer to the epicenter of the quake, and two other districts.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the toll could rise into the thousands.
President Joko Widodo visited a housing complex flattened when the quake liquefied the soil it stood on, and called for patience.
""I know there are many problems that need to be solved in a short time, including communications,"" he said. 
The ruins would be rebuilt, he said, as aftershocks rattled the region 48 hours after the quake.
Scores of residents shouted ""we're hungry, we need food"" as soldiers distributed rations from a truck in one neighborhood, while elsewhere television showed pictures of people making off with clothes and other items from a wrecked mall.
Internal affairs minister Tjahjo Kumolo, asked about reports of sporadic looting, said he had ordered authorities to help people get food and drink and businesses would be compensated.
National disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference the affected area was bigger than initially thought, though rescuers only had good access to one of four affected districts - Palu.
""We haven't received reports from the three other areas. Communication is still down, power is still out. We don't know for sure what is the impact,"" he said.
""There are many areas where the search and rescue teams haven't been able to reach,"" Nugroho said, adding that teams needed heavy equipment to move broken concrete.
Five foreigners - three French, one South Korean and one Malaysian - were among the missing, he said. The 832 fatalities included people crushed in collapsing buildings and swept to their death by tsunami waves.
About 16,000 displaced people needed clean water, Nugroho said, while 540 were injured, many getting treatment in tents.
Donggala town has been extensively damaged, with houses swept into the sea and bodies trapped in debris, according to a Metro TV reporter on the scene. The Red Cross said it had heard nothing from the region.
""This is extremely worrying,"" it said in a statement.
Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said the government had allocated 560 billion rupiah ($37.58 million) for disaster recovery, media reported.
QUESTIONS ABOUT WARNINGS
Indonesia, which sits on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, is all too familiar with deadly earthquakes and tsunamis. In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean, killing 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.
Questions are sure to be asked why warning systems set up around the country after that disaster appear to have failed on Friday.
The meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the quake but lifted it 34 minutes later, drawing criticism it had been too hasty. But officials said they estimated the waves had hit while the warning was in force. 
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on Palu's beach when the water surged ashore. A disaster official said the tsunami traveled across the sea at speeds of 800 kph (500 mph) before striking the shore.
Video footage on social media showed water and whirls of debris rushing in as people scattered.
Palu is at the head of a narrow bay, about 10 km long and 2 km wide, which had ""amplified"" the force of the wave as it was funneled toward the city, a geophysics agency official said.
Questions have been raised about what caused the tsunami, with speculation an underwater landslide was to blame.
The BMKG said its closest sensor, about 200 km (125 miles) from Palu, had only recorded an ""insignificant"", 6 cm (2.5 inches) wave, while researchers said it was surprising the quake, which was recorded as a ""strike-slip"", when tectonic plates move horizontally against each other rather than vertically, had generated a tsunami.
""It may be that the shock of the quake triggered a landslide underwater,"" Abdul Muhari, who heads a tsunami research team that advises the government, told Reuters.
Palu's airport was damaged in the quake, but had reopened for limited commercial flights, authorities said.

Kansai International Airport in Osaka, western Japan, which was heavily flooded by a typhoon last month, said it had closed its runways from 11 a.m. (0200 GMT) on Sunday until 6 a.m. on Monday. The airport only fully reopened on Sept. 21.
Airlines canceled or plan to cancel more than 930 flights, public broadcaster NHK said. And most of local trains and bullet trains in western areas will suspend operations on Sunday, operator West Japan Railway said.
Japan issued evacuation orders and warnings to about 700,000 households in southern and western Japan and more than 300,000 households have suffered power outages in southern Okinawa and Kagoshima prefectures, said NHK, adding nearly 50 people had been injured in Okinawa and Kagoshima.

The announcement by Deborah Ramirez's lawyer John Clune indicates that the FBI probe of Kavanaugh will look beyond separate allegations of attempted rape leveled against the conservative federal appeals court judge by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a dramatic Senate hearing this week.
Ramirez alleges that Kavanaugh exposed his penis to her during a drunken party at a Yale University dormitory when they were undergraduates. Kavanaugh denies both Ford's and Ramirez's allegations.
""We can confirm the FBI has reached out to interview Ms. Ramirez and she has agreed to cooperate with their investigation,"" Clune said in a tweet.
""Out of respect for the integrity of the process, we will have no further comment at this time.""
U.S. President Donald Trump bowed to pressure from moderate Senate Republicans and ordered the FBI investigation after Thursday's Senate hearing, during which Ford, a California university professor, detailed her claims that Kavanaugh tried to rape her at a party in 1982 when the two were still high school teenagers.
On Saturday, NBC News reported that the White House had constrained the FBI investigation by limiting its parameters. Trump denied that story, tweeting that ""Actually, I want them to interview whoever they deem appropriate, at their discretion.""
White House spokesman Raj Shah said the Senate had set the ""scope and duration"" of the FBI probe, which is supposed to be wrapped up in a week. ""The White House is letting the FBI agents do what they are trained to do,"" Shah said.
Michael Avenatti, the attorney for a third Kavanaugh accuser, Julie Swetnick, said in an email to Reuters that his client has not been contacted by investigators.

If confirmed to a lifetime Supreme Court appointment, Kavanaugh would consolidate conservative control of the nation's highest court and advance Trump's effort to shift the American judiciary to the right.

SKOPJE (Reuters) - Macedonians go to polls on Sunday to vote on whether to change their country's name to Republic of North Macedonia, urged by a pro-Western government to pave the way for NATO and EU membership by resolving a decades-old name dispute with Greece.
The referendum is one of the last hurdles for a deal reached between Macedonia and Greece in June to settle their quarrel, which has prevented Macedonia from joining major Western institutions since it broke away from then-Yugoslavia in 1991.
Greece, which has its own northern province called Macedonia, has always maintained that Macedonia's name represented a claim on its territory. It vetoed Macedonia's entrance into NATO and the EU, and forced it to enter the United Nations under a provisional name as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia or FYROM.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argues that accepting a new name is a price worth paying for admission into the EU and NATO. But nationalist opponents say it would undermine the ethnic identity of the country's Slavic majority population. President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will boycott the referendum. 
Polls for some 1.8 million voters will open at 7 a.m. and close at 7 p.m. The question on the referendum ballot is: ""Are you for NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece"".
The referendum is advisory and not legally binding, but enough members of parliament have said they will abide by its outcome to make it decisive. The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
For the referendum to be valid, at least 50 percent of voters must turn out to vote and a majority of them must back the change.
Polls have indicated that a large majority of those who vote are likely to back the change, but achieving the required turnout may be difficult. While more than 80 percent of Macedonians support NATO and EU membership, many may boycott the referendum because of disagreement with the name change.
""The Macedonian people have never been so embarrassed than now with this agreement (with Greece),"" said Violeta Petkoska, a 39-year-old nurse. ""On the day of the referendum they want us to dig our own grave, so that from the next day the Macedonian people do not exist.""
Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment in the country with unemployment rate of more than 20 percent. 
""Macedonia should move forward to become a European state. We have no alternative,"" said Asim Shainovski, 35, a public administration worker. 

U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis has accused Russia of attempting to influence the outcome of the referendum, which the Kremlin has denied. 
Macedonia avoided the violence that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia, but was later rocked by an ethnic Albanian insurgency that almost tore the country apart in 2001.
Western governments see NATO and European Union membership as the best way of preserving the peace and stability in the Balkans after a decade of wars with the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.

317,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2018 06:25PM ET</span>",California governor signs gun control bills into law,"(Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown signed several gun control bills into law on Friday, including one measure that raises the minimum age for buying rifles and shotguns from 18 to 21. 
The new laws come seven months after a gunman opened fire with a semiautomatic assault-style rifle at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 14 students and three adults, the second-deadliest mass shooting at a public school in U.S. history.
The rampage, which authorities say was carried out by a former student who was 19, has spurred unprecedented activism by victims and their families to prevent future gun violence and demanding stricter gun control across the United States.
California already has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation. State Senator Anthony Portantino, the Democrat lawmaker who wrote the bill, said the rampage in Florida along with other shootings at high schools motivated him. 
""No parent should have to worry that a gun gets in the wrong hands and commits a heinous and violent tragedy on our school campuses,"" he said in a statement. 
The new California laws, which go into effect Jan. 1, exempt law enforcement officers and military service members. 
Federal law already prohibits people younger than 21 from buying a handgun from a licensed firearms dealer. 
Brown also signed legislation that bans firearm possession for people convicted of serious domestic violence charges along with people who have been hospitalized for mental health problems more than once in one year. 
He did not comment on the legislation. 
He also signed a bill that makes it easier for family members and police to take firearms and ammunition away from people who are believed to be a threat to commit violence. 
Three weeks after the shooting in Parkland, Florida lawmakers raised the legal age for buying rifles and imposed a three-day waiting period on all gun sales.
The National Rifle Association (NRA) responded by filing a federal lawsuit seeking to overturn the new Florida laws, saying they violated Americans’ constitutional rights.

“We will continue to oppose gun control measures that only serve to punish law abiding citizens,” wrote Daniel Reid, the director of the NRA in California, in a letter to state lawmakers, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The two officers, Corporal Zack Moak, 31, and Patrolman James White, 35, were transported to a Brookhaven hospital where they were pronounced dead, Strain said in the email.
The 25-year-old suspect, Marquis Aaron Flowers, who lives near the house where the shooting took place, was wounded in the gunfight and later taken to a Jackson hospital. 
Flowers' medical condition was not immediately known and it was not clear if he had an attorney. An investigation into the shooting is ongoing.
The Brookhaven police chief did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant on Twitter called on people to pray for ""the family and loved ones of these fallen heroes.""

321,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",Congo's opposition leaders warn of vote-rigging risk in presidential poll,"By Giulia Paravicini
KINSHASA (Reuters) - Congo's opposition leaders warned thousands of supporters at a rally in the capital Kinshasa on Saturday of what they say are moves by the government to steal the presidential election in December, when Joseph Kabila is due to step down after 17 years. 
The introduction of electronic voting and the authorities' exclusion of a number of candidates from the ballot has united opposition parties ahead of the long-delayed vote on Dec. 23 that will choose a successor to Kabila.
Despite the suspension of all state public transport in the capital and the presence of heavily armed police, the rally site was thronged with supporters waving flags and hand-made signs with slogans such as 'RIP voting machines.'
Addressing the crowd, Felix Tshisekedi, the president of Congo's largest opposition party and a front-runner to replace Kabila, said opposition forces would remain united in the run-up to the election.
""No one will divide us. We will not cheat, anyone who cheats will provoke a scandal,"" he said.
While united on some issues, opposition leaders have yet to coalesce behind a single candidate despite repeated promises to do so.
A key common concern relates to the introduction of tablet-style devices for voting, which some say are more vulnerable to vote-rigging and could be compromised by the unreliability of Congo's power supply. 
The authorities argue the system will cut costs, help reduce electoral fraud and accelerate the counting of votes in the vast central African country where past elections have been marred by voting irregularities or violence.
""They are not voting machines they are cheating machines,"" opposition leader Jean-Pierre Bemba said via video-link from Brussels.
""They are not reliable, too slow and there are 10 million fake voters who have already been registered. We, the opposition, have united to say no to the machines,"" he said.
Western governments and investors regard the vote as a crucial step towards ending political instability that is impeding investment in Congo, which is rich in natural resources but mired in poverty and economic and humanitarian crises.
But widespread voting irregularities would undermine what is hoped will be Congo's first democratic change of power.
""We are ready for December 23 but we want fair and transparent elections. We do not want the voting machines, they are not ready to be used,"" construction firm worker Eleck Tshibuabua,41, said on the sidelines of the rally.
On Tuesday, outgoing president Kabila told the annual U.N. gathering of world leaders that the election would be peaceful and credible.

Kabila has ruled since his father's assassination in 2001. He agreed last month not to defy term limits by running for re-election, calming tensions following his refusal to step down when his constitutional mandate expired in December 2016.

BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party apologized on Saturday after releasing a phone app for the annual party conference that let members of the public log in as senior government ministers and view their personal details.
Dawn Foster, a columnist with the Guardian newspaper, discovered that a flaw in the app allowed users to log in as anyone attending the party conference, simply by entering an email address.
It meant the mobile phone numbers of all those attending the four-day event - journalists, party members and lawmakers, including senior government ministers - could be accessed. On Twitter, Foster showed how she had been able to log into the system as former foreign secretary Boris Johnson. 
""It's let me login as Boris Johnson, and just straight up given me all the details used for his registration,"" she wrote. ""I'm the most tech illiterate person alive, and I've done this, imagine there are plenty more security bugs.""
The loophole in the app was closed after the security breach was pointed out to the party but not before the details of some politicians had been accessed and in some instances changed.
A journalist from the BuzzFeed website said at least two cabinet ministers had received prank calls from the public as a consequence.
""The technical issue has been resolved and the app is now functioning securely,"" a Conservative spokesman said. ""We are investigating the issue further and apologize for any concern caused.""
Last year, May's major conference speech descended into chaos after she suffered a coughing fit, a prankster gained access to the stage to hand her the form given to sacked employees, and some letters of her party's slogans dropped to the ground from a sign on the stage behind her as she spoke.

""I think people will see a really impressive conference all round this year,"" Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis told Sky News before news of the security breach was revealed.

For the past month, Canada has been locked in tense discussions with the United States to reach common ground on revamping the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) after Mexico and Washington said they had reached a deal on Aug. 27. 
Mexico on Friday said the U.S. Trump administration and Canada were making efforts to resolve their differences, raising hopes the pact could be kept trilateral.
Freeland spokesman Adam Austen said Freeland had returned to Canada to take part in work on NAFTA. However, he added that she had no plans to return to Washington for the moment.

Freeland was due to address the General Assembly on Saturday. Canada's spot on the list of speakers has been moved to Monday, Canada's U.N. mission said.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday continued sanctions were deepening its mistrust in the United States and there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances. 
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken ""significant goodwill measures"" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missiles tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
""However, we do not see any corresponding response from the U.S.,"" he said.
""Without any trust in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first.""
While Ri reprised familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a ""phased"" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement appeared significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization out of hand as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first ever summit between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward ""denuclearization of the Korean peninsula"" while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korea War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first. Washington has also resisted calls to relax tough international sanctions on North Korea.
""The U.S. insists on the 'denuclearization-first' and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of war,'"" Ri said.
""The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe dream of the people who are ignorant about us. But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust.""
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier in the week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: ""If the party to this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the U.S., the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock.""
DIFFERENT TONE 
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after ""Mr Evil President"" Trump called Kim a ""rocket man"" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea, heaped praise on Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still had to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes. 
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for this, saying ""If it takes two years, three years or five months - doesn't matter.""
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: ""Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize the fully, final, verified denuclearization.""
The Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well. He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours to denounce him for making ""gangster-like demands.""
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took ""corresponding measures.""
Moon told an event in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. meeting that declaring a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War would encourage North Korea to move further with denuclearization.

He said Kim had told him the ""corresponding measures"" he was seeking were security guarantees Trump pledged in Singapore and moves toward normalization of relations with Washington.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States announced on Friday it will effectively close its consulate in the Iraqi city of Basra and relocate diplomatic personnel assigned there following increasing threats from Iran and Iran-backed militia, including rocket fire.
The decision adds to mounting tension between the United States and Iran, which is the target of increasing U.S. economic sanctions. 
In Tehran, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said the consulate closure was ""unjustified and unnecessary"", and said Iran condemned any attack on diplomats or diplomatic locations, according to the ministry's website.
Iraq's Foreign Ministry said it regretted the decision and urged foreign diplomats not to pay attention to ""what is being circulated to undermine the climate of security and stability accompanying Iraq's relations with the countries of the world.""
Iraq is committed to protecting diplomatic missions, spokesman Ahmed Mahgoub said in a statement on Saturday.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as he explained the move, renewed a warning that the United States would hold Iran directly responsible for any attacks on Americans and U.S. diplomatic facilities.
It followed recent rocket attacks that Pompeo said were directed at the consulate in Basra. U.S. officials said the rockets, however, had not impacted the consulate, which is located on the Basra airport compound.
""I have made clear that Iran should understand that the United States will respond promptly and appropriately to any such attacks,"" Pompeo said in a statement.
Pompeo did not explicitly say whether a U.S. response was imminent, however, and other U.S. officials did not disclose potential response options.
Still, Pompeo said the threats against U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq were ""increasing and specific"" and added that Washington was working with Iraqi forces and U.S. allies to address them.
""We look to all international parties interested in peace and stability in Iraq and the region to reinforce our message to Iran regarding the unacceptability of their behavior,"" he said.
'CHAOS, DEATH AND DESTRUCTION'
In a statement, the U.S. State Department said the consulate was placed on ""ordered departure,"" which technically involves a drawdown in staff. Although some personnel could remain on the diplomatic compound, the move is believed to effectively close the consulate, at least temporarily. 
The decision came days after U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani exchanged taunts at the United Nations General Assembly, with Trump vowing more sanctions and accusing Iran's leaders of sowing ""chaos, death and destruction.""
Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, speaking at a nearby event in New York on Tuesday, warned ""there will indeed be hell to pay"" if Iran crosses the United States, its allies or harms U.S. citizens.
In May, Trump withdrew the United States from an international deal to put curbs on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for easing sanctions. 
France, Britain, Germany, China and Russia have stayed in the pact, vowing to save it despite the restoration of U.S. sanctions. The rial has lost 40 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar since April. 
Iran has blamed U.S. sanctions for the currency's fall, saying the measures amount to a ""political, psychological and economic"" war on Tehran, and accused the United States and Israel of involvement in a deadly attack at a military parade in southwestern Iran this month.
Basra has already been rocked by violent protests seen by experts as a rejection of the Iraqi political establishment that has held on to power -- with the support of the United States and Iran -- despite failing to improve people's lives there.
Protesters in Basra ransacked and torched Iraqi government buildings this month and the Iranian consulate was set alight by demonstrators shouting condemnation of what many see as Iran's sway over Iraq's affairs.

For the first time in several years, mortar shells also landed this month inside Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone, which houses parliament, government buildings and many foreign embassies.

COLOGNE, Germany (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan wrapped up an ill-tempered visit to Germany on Saturday with a visit to Cologne, where a security lockdown kept supporters and protesters away from a ceremony to open the country's largest mosque.
Police snipers were stationed on rooftops and the area was cordoned off after the city authorities canceled plans for up to 25,000 people to be allowed to gather outside the mosque, built by an Islamic religious organization that has close ties to the Turkish state.
Germany had invited Erdogan for the three-day state visit in an attempt to mend ties hit by a crackdown on his opponents following a failed coup in 2016, hoping to secure the release of several of its citizens who remain in detention. 
Chancellor Angela Merkel said after meeting Erdogan on Friday that ""deep divisions"" remain. On Saturday in Cologne, the Turkish leader sought to strike a conciliatory note.
""In a critical period, we have made a fruitful, successful visit to Germany,"" he told guests at the opening of the Central Mosque. ""I stressed that we need to put aside our differences and focus on our common interests.""
Yet he also called on Germany to crack down on Kurdish separatists, and complained that soccer star Mesut Ozil had been hounded out of the German national team after Germany's World Cup exit because of his Turkish roots.
""This racism has to end,"" said Erdogan.
At a banquet hosted by President Frank Walter Steinmeier on Friday night the Turkish leader, departing from his prepared remarks, accused Germany of harboring terrorists, according to those present.
""Hate speech against Germany,"" ran the headline in Saturday's edition of best-selling daily Bild.
NEITHER BETTER NOR SIMPLER
Senior Merkel allies said the visit had been premature, and ruled out providing any fresh economic aid to Turkey, which has suffered a slump in its currency following the imposition of trade sanctions by Washington.
""The timing of this visit was wrong - it was far too early,"" Norbert Roettgen, chairman of parliament's foreign affairs committee, told the Funke newspaper group. ""The Turkish-German relationship is neither better nor simpler after this visit.""
In Cologne, a major center of the 3 million-strong Turkish community in Germany, a few hundred Erdogan supporters gathered behind security barriers waving flags and wearing scarves in Turkey's red-and-white national colors.
""It's a great honor for us,"" said supporter Ali Tas of Erdogan's visit.
Around 1,000 protesters - including emigres and German left-wing activists - gathered on the opposite bank of the River Rhine after being denied permission to march through the city center.
""I don't like that the German government is in cahoots with a head of state who locks up people, imprisons journalists and (ethnically) cleanses his own country,"" said a German man who gave his name as Goetz.
Regional chief minister Armin Laschet did not attend the mosque opening, citing the importance of separating state and religion. Other local civic leaders complained that they were not invited to the event.

Erdogan and Laschet met earlier at Cologne airport. They were to have held talks at a stately home, but the venue was switched after its owners objected.

""Let's work together for a new Kosovo...Kosovo is one, unique, independent and a sovereign country,"" President Hashim Thaci told Kosovo media at Lake Gazivode, an artificial lake in a mainly ethnic Serb area. Serbia's President Alexander Vucic had visited the lake on Sept. 8.
Kosovo's mainly ethnic Albanian security forces generally stay out of the small, mainly ethnic Serbian pocket of territory in the north, which Kosovo and Serbia dispute. 
Thaci was quoted as saying he had coffee with workers at the lake. Serbia accused Kosovo police of seizing control of the lake and briefly detaining four workers. Kosovo said the police were there to provide security for the visit and nobody was detained.
The fate of ethnic Serb villages in northern Kosovo is one of the main issues of disagreement between Serbia and Kosovo, a former province of Serbia which declared independence after Serbian forces were driven out by NATO bombing in a war in 1999.
Both sides have said they could agree to swapping Kosovo territory populated by Serbs for Serbian territory populated by Albanians. However, expectations of such a deal dimmed in recent weeks after a meeting between Thaci and Vucic was abruptly canceled. Vucic toured the disputed area the next day.
Marko Djuric, head of Serbia's government office for Kosovo, said Serbia was putting its military as well as police under high alert as a result of Kosovo action in the area.
""Due to an Albanian attack against the north of Kosovo and the arrest of some Serbs who have not committed any crime, I ordered the police director to put all special police units in state of the highest readiness,"" Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic said.
Vucic was expected to address the nation later on Saturday.
Thaci's unexpected visit to the north came hours before ethnic Albanian nationalists held a planned demonstration in the capital Pristina against the president's willingness to discuss adjusting the border with Serbia.

Moving the frontier ""is not a correction but a pain and loss for us"", Albin Kurti, leader of the opposition Vetevendosje party, told a crowd of thousands at the demonstration. “Kosovo cannot be partitioned. We will not negotiate independence.”

328,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2018 11:04AM ET</span>",Six arrested in Barcelona on day of protests for and against Catalan independence,"Barcelona (Reuters) - Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday as protesters for and against independence scuffled with police, two days before the first anniversary of a vote on secession that polarized the Spanish region. 
Two people were arrested after separatist protesters threw powder paint at riot police who were keeping them apart from a rival unionist demonstration. 
Another four were arrested later on Saturday.
Fourteen people received treatment for injuries sustained in the protests, all of them minor, local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 vote deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Pro-independence groups had camped out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of police deployed in Catalonia during last year's failed bid to split from Spain.
The demonstration went ahead but was forced to take a different route.
Voters chose overwhelmingly to become independent, though turnout was low with those against secession largely boycotting the vote. According to Catalan authorities almost 1000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region. 
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the separatist protest with his wife said he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence. ""Last year we lived through one of our best moments. I watched my parents cry with joy at being able to vote but now we are stuck,"" he said.
Despite managing a vital if narrow victory in regional elections last December, Catalan pro independence parties have struggled to retain momentum this year with many of their best known leaders either in self imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial or charges ???? for their role in organizing last year's vote and subsequent declaration of independence.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial jail since late last year, announced he would run in European Parliament elections next year.
""Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government,"" he said.
Over several hours pro-independence groups chanting ""Neither forgetting nor forgiveness"" faced off with unionist protesters chanting ""Long live Spain"" ahead of a weekend of further demonstrations planned to mark last year's vote. 

Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recording the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict had been stoked by politicians on both sides. ""It’s getting more and more tense,"" he said.

CAIRO (Reuters) - An Egyptian court has sentenced an activist to two years in jail over a video she posted on social media criticizing the government for failing to protect women against sexual harassment and over poor living conditions, her lawyer said.
Amal Fathy, a member of the now banned April 6 youth movement which played a role in 2011 protests that forced President Hosni Mubarak from office, was also fined 10,000 Egyptian pounds ($562), her lawyer Tarek Abuel Nasr and state news agency MENA said. 
She was charged with spreading false news that threatened national security and disseminating a video that violated public decency. She also faces other charges including joining an illegal group. 
""This is injustice, unjustified and incomprehensible. We have provided all the evidence to prove that she didn't spread false news,"" said her husband, Mohamed Lotfy, a human rights activist and executive director of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF).
""When a woman is subjected to sexual harassment and gets sentenced to two years and fined then this means we are telling all Egyptian women 'shut your mouths ...if you don't want to go to prison'."" 
Government officials were not immediately available to comment.
Fathy will appeal the ruling, her lawyer said.
Rights groups have repeatedly criticized Egypt's human rights situation, saying conditions have continued to deteriorate under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who came to power in 2013 after the army overthrew Islamist President Mohamed Morsi following protests against his rule.
Seventeen U.N. human rights experts criticized Egypt on Friday for its use of anti-terrorism laws to detain activists fighting for women's rights and against graft, torture and extra-judicial killings.
Fathy was detained in May, days after she posted a 12-minute video in which she expressed her anger at poor public services at a local bank, heavy traffic, sexual harassment by a taxi driver and over a general deterioration in living conditions.
At the time a security source said Fathy had been detained over a complaint that she had insulted the Egyptian state through an offensive social media posting.
Egypt passed a law in July giving the state powers to block social media accounts and penalize journalists held to be publishing fake news.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday kicks off a week of rallies in five friendly places around the country, seeking to shore up support ahead of congressional elections even as the fate of his pick to fill a Supreme Court vacancy remains unclear.
Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress in the Nov. 6 elections, which could impede Trump's goals to clamp down on immigration, cut taxes, approve new bilateral trade deals, and invest in infrastructure.
Allegations of sexual misconduct against Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, have complicated his confirmation proceedings, disappointing conservative voters and energizing Democrats. Kavanaugh denies the accusations.
Trump travels first to Wheeling, West Virginia, on Saturday, where Republicans are trying to unseat Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, one of a handful of senators seen as key swing votes that will determine Kavanaugh's appointment. 
Trump will then hold evening rallies in Johnson City, Tennessee, on Monday; Southaven, Mississippi, on Tuesday; Rochester, Minnesota, on Thursday; and Topeka, Kansas, next Saturday.
The Trump campaign said the rallies are aimed at energizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.
""Control of Congress is so critical for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we head into the busy campaign season,"" a Trump campaign spokesman said, declining to be named.
A third of the Senate and all House seats are in play. Power could shift if Democrats gain two Senate seats and 23 House seats.
Saturday's visit will be Trump's second in recent weeks to West Virginia - a state he won by more than 40 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election - to campaign for Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing Manchin in polls.
""It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to give him a boost in the polls,"" said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Trump's next two rallies will be in states he also won handily in 2016: Tennessee, which he took by more than 20 points, and Mississippi, where he won by 18 points.
Tennessee's former governor, Phil Bredesen, and U.S. Representative Marsha Blackburn are in a tight race for a Senate seat held by retiring Republican Bob Corker.
In Mississippi, two Republicans and two Democrats are in a special election primary battle for a Senate seat vacated by Republican Thad Cochran. Trump has endorsed Cindy Hyde-Smith, who would need to win 50 percent of the votes to avoid a run-off on Nov. 27.
Although Trump narrowly lost Minnesota in 2016, he won in Rochester, where he will be appearing on Thursday to support Republicans, including Karin Housley, who is running for the Senate, hoping to unseat Democrat Tina Smith. Smith was appointed to the seat last year after former Democratic Senator Al Franken resigned after being accused of sexual harassment.
In Kansas, a state Trump won by 20 percentage points, he will rally support for Kris Kobach's gubernatorial campaign. Kobach, who serves as the Kansas secretary of state, advised Trump's campaign on immigration restrictions and has pushed for more restrictive voting laws.
Trump is also slated to stop in Philadelphia on Tuesday to speak to a national convention of electrical contractors about workforce development, a White House official said. The planned speech was first reported by the Philadelphia Inquirer.

While the Pennsylvania stop has not been organized by Trump's campaign, the president has been actively campaigning for Republican Representative Lou Barletta, who polls show trailing in his Senate race against Democratic incumbent Bob Casey.

May next year is the most recent deadline Prayuth's junta has set for a vote its critics hope will return Thailand to civilian rule after more than four years of military government, although it has repeatedly extended the timeline.
The Palang Pracharat party, whose name is an echo of the military government's economic and social development policy, will be led by Industry Minister Uttama Savanayana, who vowed to help Thailand overcome its political divide. 
""We have wasted enough time and opportunity to develop our country,"" Uttama told reporters and party members at the launch, referring to decade-long political conflicts between supporters of ousted premiers Thaksin and Yingluck Shinawatra and the pro-military royalist establishment. 
The announcement came days after Prayuth said he was ""interested in politics."" The four ministers are the first of Prayuth's cabinet members to form a political party, possibly to support his role in the next election. Like Prayuth, the ministers said they would not resign from their current posts. 
Commerce Minister Sontirat Sontijirawong, the party's secretary-general, said Palang Pracharat was not about prolonging military rule as it was ""not affiliated with the military"" and had ""no military members.""  
Asked whether the party would support Prayuth to stay on as prime minister, Sontirat said: ""We still don't know how he will decide and which party he will join ... We'll have to wait to hear more from him.""
""We'll choose the best person for the country,"" he added.

The party's other founders include Science and Technology Minister Suvit Maesincee and Kobsak Pootrakool, minister attached to the prime minister's office.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Brazilian women are expected to take to the streets on Saturday, protesting what they see as the misogynist ways of one of Brazil's most divisive presidential candidates in years: right-wing Congressman Jair Bolsonaro.
In a series of marches stretching from Manaus in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) jungle to the megacity of Sao Paulo in the nation's southeast, demonstrators organized under the hash tag #EleNao, or #NotHim, are pledging not to vote for the candidate who has made light of rape and called the gender pay gap justified.
Bolsonaro, a federal deputy from Rio de Janeiro, is the frontrunner in opinion polls, winning over many Brazilians with his ultra-hard-line stance on crime, unvarnished rhetoric, and a career that has been largely free of corruption accusations.
Yet he has also repelled many by commentary widely considered sexist, misogynist, and homophobic.
His relative lack of support among women could spell trouble for the candidate, a former army captain who has become the market favorite after embracing free-market policies on the campaign trail.
His biggest rival and likely opponent in a probable second round run-off is leftist candidate Fernando Haddad. 
Former Sao Paulo mayor Haddad is running for the Workers Party, whose jailed founder, former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, was barred from the election by a corruption conviction. Despite widespread dislike of the Workers Party, Haddad has surged in polls with support from the working class and many voters who cannot stomach his right-wing opponent.
According to a recent survey by pollster Ibope, 18 percent of women plan to vote for Bolsonaro in the Oct. 7 first round, versus 36 percent of men. In an Oct. 28 second round scenario, among those who expressed a preference, women plumped 47 to 30 percent for Haddad over Bolsonaro, while among men 47 percent went for Bolsonaro, and 37 percent for Haddad.

MALE (Reuters) - The Elections Commission of Maldives on Saturday officially declared opposition leader Ibrahim Mohamed Solih winner of the country's national election, defeating president Abdulla Yameen who had sought a delay in publication of the final results.
The Election Commission Secretary General Salah Rasheed said Solih's Maldivian Democratic Party had won by a 16.8 percentage margin, with an 89.2 percent voter turnout.
Election Chief Ahmed Shareef said the commission had received 423 complaints about the election by Thursday, of which 194 were outstanding.
""The Complaints Bureau and the Commission have decided that none of the complaints filed with the commission will affect the outcome of the election,"" Shareef told reporters in the capital Male. 
He said all five election commissioners had received threatening telephone calls after Sunday's election.
""We also received several phone calls in which we (the commissioners) were threatened with physical harm. We did not respond to it because the state's security services were providing security arrangements for all the commissioners.""
The police and military have said they will uphold the result of the election.
Yameen conceded defeat on Monday, but his party later requested a delay in announcing the official result, which some in the opposition believed may have been an attempt to have the election resulted annulled.
Yameen, who will be president until Nov. 17 according to the constitution, has jailed political opponents and cracked down on dissent. 
The Maldives is best known as a luxury holiday destination and is key to a battle for influence between India and China.
It has faced political upheaval since February when Yameen imposed a state of emergency to annul a Supreme Court ruling that quashed the convictions of nine opposition leaders, including former president Mohamed Nasheed, the country's first democratically elected leader.

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - The teddy bears belonged in a child’s bedroom, the votive candles in a local church. Instead, they were among the thousands of items left by the grieving near the site of the largest mass shooting in modern American history.
They are now part of “How We Mourned,” a somber exhibit at the Clark County Museum that helps mark the first anniversary of the Oct. 1, 2017 shooting spree that killed 58 people and wounded over 800 at an outdoor festival on the Las Vegas Strip.
Stephen Paddock, 64, a retired real estate investor, poured gunfire from his 32nd-floor hotel suite into a crowd of 20,000 people attending the Route 91 Harvest festival last Oct. 1, then killed himself before police stormed his room.
In August, authorities closed their investigation without an explanation for what motivated Paddock.
After the carnage, scores of Las Vegas residents and visitors placed an eclectic array of offerings in various areas of the gambling mecca, including the traffic island that’s home to the iconic “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas” sign. 
Museum Administrator Mark Hall-Patton said only a relatively small portion of the more than 15,000 items collected - approximately 3,000 - were displayed in the exhibit. 
With 25 volunteers spending 7,000 hours sorting, photographing and cataloguing what Hall-Patton called trailerloads of items, the artifacts will eventually be placed in storage and made available for study.
“Anything that could be saved, we saved,” Hall-Patton said. “We’re not done yet.""  The exhibit is on display until Feb. 28.
The items include everything from stuffed animals, painted rocks and artificial flower bouquets to T-shirts, cowboy hats, whiskey bottles and rosaries. 
Schools from as far away as Canada sent letters expressing sympathy. A group from Hawaii brought a peace lei hundreds of yards long, with 58 white crosses. Contributions have come in from around the world.
“This is an international exhibit,” Hall-Patton said, noting tourists “flew into town from overseas” just to present their offerings and pay their respects.”
Many of the items, including a large hand-painted “Vegas Strong” banner signed by hundreds of well-wishers, were created without a thought given to preservation for future generations.
“One of the challenges we have is, how are we going to preserve that?” he said. “They were looked at as a short-term statement of care.”
Sorting through the vast assortment of items from such an emotional time in the community’s history was at times difficult, he said.
“It affects everybody,” Hall-Patton said. “You walk away sometimes. But this is what we do.”

The closure of the crossing in 2015 cut an important transit route for hundreds of trucks a day transporting goods between Turkey and the Gulf, and Lebanon and the Gulf.
Syrian forces restored control over the route in July. 
The latest Syrian statement corrected an earlier one saying the restoration of the movement of trucks and goods through the crossing had already begun.
The Jordanian government had denied that assertion, saying the two sides were still studying the reopening of the border between the two countries.
""Jaber Nassib crossing is still closed. It hasn't reopened yet for movement of goods and passengers,"" an official statement quoted Jordanian government spokeswoman Joumana Ghonaimat as saying. 
Billions of dollars in annual trade moved through the crossing, in southern Syria, before fighting started in 2011 and its closure has hit the economy of Syria and its neighbors.
Following the official denial by Amman, Syrian state media ran a new statement by the transportation ministry saying that ""logistic preparations to reopen the crossing are now complete, so that the Nassib border crossing with Jordan will reopen on the tenth of October and start receiving truck and transit traffic.""
The Jordanian government, in its statement, did not set a specific date for an opening. 
Lebanon's economy minister told Reuters in July the crossing was ""a vital artery"" for the Lebanese economy.
The Syrian government has recovered control of most of the country with the help of its Russian and Iranian allies.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A powerful typhoon brought heavy rain and high winds as it approached southern Japan on Saturday, causing power outages in several cities and prompting Kansai International Airport near Osaka to plan a temporary closure of its runways from Sunday.
Typhoon Trami, rated category 2 by Tropical Storm Risk, with category 5 the highest, is the latest storm to threaten Japan in a year of weather-related woes, including punishing heat, heavy rains and landslides.
Outlying islands in the Okinawan chain, some 1,000 km southwest of Tokyo, were being pounded by heavy rain and high tides a day before an Okinawan gubernatorial election on Sunday.
Strong wind knocked down trees, blew off an outer wall from a building and left nine people injured in Okinawa. Trami also caused power outages in more than 30 towns, according to public broadcaster NHK.
Kansai International Airport in Osaka, western Japan, which was heavily flooded by a typhoon last month, announced that it would close its runways from 11 a.m. (0200 GMT) until 6 a.m. on Monday. The airport only fully reopened on Sept. 21.
NHK also said airlines had canceled more than 390 flights, mainly those flying in and out of Okinawa. More flight cancellations were planned for Sunday.
Churning north across Okinawa on Saturday, Trami is predicted to move across the islands of Kyushu and the main island of Honshu on Sunday, a path similar to that taken by typhoon Jebi early in September.
Bullet trains running between the two western Japan cities of Osaka and Hiroshima will suspend operations on Sunday morning in anticipation of heavy rain and wind, operator West Japan Railway said on Saturday.

Last month's Typhoon Jebi, the most powerful storm to hit Japan in 25 years, brought some of the highest tides since a 1961 typhoon.

In late 2015, China passed a new anti-terrorism law that allows the military to venture overseas on counter-terror operations, though experts have said Beijing faces big practical and diplomatic problems to actually execute such an action. 
China says it faces a threat not only from home-grown Islamists in its far western region of Xinjiang, but also from militants in the Middle East, some of whom it says are from Xinjiang.
In November 2015, Islamic State said it had killed a Chinese citizen it had taken hostage in the Middle East.
In an interview with the official Xinhua news agency, Zhang Xiaoqi, intelligence chief at China's paramilitary People's Armed Police which is part of the Chinese military, said developing special forces was an important component of the country's overall military modernization.
""The mission scope of the special forces stretches from land to sea, from home to abroad,"" Zhang said.
He said that ""anti-terror fight preparations"" must be ready to safeguard national strategic interests anywhere.
""We must work hard to build an internationally first-rate counter-terror crack force,"" Zhang added, without giving details.
China, which has consistently said that it does not interfere in the affairs of other countries, is the only permanent member of the U.N. Security Council which has not taken military action in Syria.
The government is yet to specify how any overseas military, counter-terror operation would work.

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday struck down a Kentucky law requiring abortion providers to sign advance agreements with hospitals and ambulance services for emergency patient care, in a ruling that keeps the state from revoking the license of its only remaining abortion clinic.
U.S. District Judge Greg Stivers in Louisville sided with the EMW Women's Surgical Center and Planned Parenthood in challenging a law that threatened to make Kentucky the first U.S. state without a single legal abortion provider.
""This decision keeps open the doors of the only health center in Kentucky that provides safe and legal abortion care,"" Planned Parenthood said in a statement.
The Louisville clinic filed suit last year claiming that Governor Matt Bevin, a self-described ""unapologetically pro-life"" Republican, was using the law unfairly to terminate its license, following a 2016 licensing battle that forced the shutdown of a Lexington clinic. 
Planned Parenthood joined in the suit, asserting that the state was likewise blocking its application for a license to begin offering abortion services at a new clinic in Louisville.
Bevin has argued that requirements for clinics to keep so-called transfer and transport agreements, stipulated under a 1998 law, were meant to protect women should complications arise during abortion procedures. 
But plaintiffs countered that hospitals were already legally bound to accept any patient in an emergency and that local fire and rescue departments will transport patients without such agreements.
Christie Gillespie, chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, said the governor had in effect turned what had been a routine licensing requirement into an obstacle by putting pressure on hospitals to deny transfer agreements with abortion providers. 
Planned Parenthood said the state threatened in March of 2017 to revoke EMW's license by citing alleged technical deficiencies in its transfer and transport agreements that had been approved a year earlier.
Following a three-day trial last September, the judge ruled that the law and its requirements violated the plaintiffs' substantive due process rights under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The opinion was accompanied by a permanent injunction barring enforcement of those restrictions.
There was no immediate comment from Kentucky's governor on whether he would seek an appeal.
The case could test interpretations of a 2016 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down parts of a Texas law requiring abortion clinics to meet hospital-like standards and for clinic doctors to have admitting privileges in nearby hospitals.
A requirement for admitting privileges in Louisiana was upheld on Wednesday in a 2-1 ruling from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Abortion has been a central issue in the U.S. Senate confirmation battle over President Donald Trump's nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, a judicial conservative who abortion rights advocates worry could tip the high court in favor of further restrictions.

342,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",'Turbulence' in ties threatens U.S.-China security meeting,"By Ben Blanchard and Michael Martina
BEIJING (Reuters) - A key diplomatic and security meeting between China and the United States next month may not take place due to tensions in relations, sources briefed on the matter said, potentially the latest casualty of worsening ties.
Beijing and Washington are locked in a spiraling trade war that has seen them level increasingly severe rounds of tariffs on each other's imports. 
Friction between the world's top two economies is now moving beyond trade, with U.S. President Donald Trump accusing Beijing this week of seeking to interfere in congressional elections, marking what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
On the military front, China has been infuriated by the United States putting sanctions on the People's Liberation Army (PLA) for buying weapons from Russia, and by what Beijing sees as stepped up U.S. support for self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by China as its sacred territory.
Two Beijing-based diplomatic sources familiar with the plans said U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis were both due in Beijing next month for the U.S.-China Diplomatic and Security Dialogue, which first took place last year in Washington, a reboot of earlier high-level talks under previous administrations.
However, both sources said that this meeting was now in doubt.
""There is a lot of uncertainty because of the turbulence in the relationship,"" said one the sources.
The second source said that the People's Liberation Army was especially unhappy with the United States at the moment because of the U.S. sanctions on the Chinese military and U.S. support for Taiwan, including approving a new round of arms sales this week.
""The PLA is fed up over the Taiwan issue. They're increasingly hardline on this,"" the source said.
Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity as the trips have not been made public. They also cautioned the meetings may still take place as planned, and that no final decisions have been reached.
China's Defence Ministry said it was talking to the United States about the dialogue.
""China and the United States have all along maintained communication about the diplomatic and security dialogue,"" it said in a statement to Reuters, without elaborating.
China's Foreign Ministry said in a short statement sent to Reuters that the two countries were in ""close contact"" about the dialogue, and that if it had any other information it would release it in a timely manner. 
The U.S. Embassy in Beijing declined to comment, as did the U.S. State Department. The Pentagon said it does not discuss future travel plans.
DECOUPLING?
In his latest broadside on Wednesday, Trump accused China of seeking to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, saying that Beijing did not want him or his Republican Party to do well because of his pugnacious stance on trade.
While China has denounced what it called his ""slander"", it has so far held off taking any direct steps to retaliate.
However, prior to Trump's remarks Beijing canceled a previously set round of military talks with Washington over the sanctions on China's military, and has denied a U.S. warship permission to visit Hong Kong in October.
The Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, said on Friday there was ""no cause for panic"" over friction between Beijing and Washington, but warned that China would not be blackmailed or yield to pressure over trade.
President Xi Jinping said this week that, with the rise of unilateralism and trade protectionism, China should embark on a path of self-reliance, a startling aim for a country that has sought to project itself on the world stage and touts the benefits of global free trade.
China had already been trying to reduce its reliance on foreign technology through its Made in China 2025 initiative, though it stopped openly touting the plan earlier this year in the face of blowback from the United States.
""Divorce is the word I use,"" Tu Xinquan, a trade expert at Beijing's University of International Business and Economics who has advised the Chinese government, told Reuters recently.
""Now, most people believe Trump is trying to contain China. Many government officials think this way.""
Last week, Jack Ma, chairman of Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), said bilateral trade frictions could last two decades, and that the firm could no longer meet its promise to create 1 million American jobs.
""I think there are leaders in the U.S. government who believe that so long as the Chinese system is not willing to change, then the next best scenario for the United States is a gradual decoupling of the economies,"" Tim Stratford, managing partner of law firm Covington & Burling's Beijing office and a former senior U.S. trade diplomat, said in a recent podcast.
China has insisted it wants to resolve all its disputes with the United States.
Ruan Zongze, a former Chinese diplomat now with the China Institute of International Studies, a think-tank affiliated with the Foreign Ministry, called it unrealistic to think the two countries could ""decouple"" considering how inter-connected they were.

""It's like two people having an argument,"" said Ruan. ""Can you really resolve it if you stop speaking to each other?""

The Alliance for Prosperity, a U.S.-led economic and security group, was launched in 2014 in an effort to curb migration from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras by boosting economic growth and funding security programs.
There was disagreement as to why the initial conference scheduled for the week of Sept. 9 was called off.
At the time, the United States said it was postponed because of ""scheduling conflicts"" and with agreement by the participating countries, but El Salvador said it was Washington's decision to suspend the meeting and that it did not know the reason.
U.S. and Central American officials have clashed in recent months. Many Central American families were affected by the U.S. government's policy earlier this year of separating migrant children and parents trying to cross the U.S.-Mexican border, and governments in the region have demanded information from the United States as they seek to reunite families.
Separately, the United States recalled its top diplomats in El Salvador this month over the nation's decision to break diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favor of China.
The Salvadoran president's office on Friday confirmed the new dates without providing further details. Officials in Guatemala and Honduras did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Outgoing Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto met with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in Mexico City on Friday to discuss security, migration, border issues and regional cooperation, his office said in a statement.

345,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2018 09:10PM ET</span>",Brazil's left presidential candidate Haddad ahead of far-right Bolsonaro: poll,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's leftist Workers Party candidate, Fernando Haddad, would defeat far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro in an expected runoff vote in next month's election, a Datafolha poll showed on Friday. 
In a simulated runoff vote, the poll found Haddad would get 45 percent voter support, beating Bolsonaro with 39 percent, with the rest of those asked saying they were undecided or would annul their ballot. Voting is compulsory in Brazil.
A second-round is required if no candidate wins a majority in the Oct. 7 first ballot, which is expected to happen. 
Bolsonaro, who has been hospitalized since being stabbed in a Sept. 6 assassination attempt, remained the leader in simulated first-round voting, taking 28 percent voter approval, as he did in a Sept. 20 Datafolha poll. Haddad took 22 percent, an increase of 6 percentage points.
Ciro Gomes, a center-left populist, had 11 percent, while business-friendly candidate Geraldo Alckmin registered 10 percent in a first-round scenario.
Datafolha surveyed 9,000 voters across Brazil from Wednesday through Friday. The poll, published by the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, has a margin of error of 2 percentage points.
Haddad earlier this month replaced jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a founder of the PT and who remains Brazil's most popular politician. He handpicked Haddad to stand in his place and polls show he is successfully transferring his support. 
Haddad, a former mayor of Sao Paulo, has pledged to govern in a pragmatic fashion, but his rise has spooked markets and sent Brazil's currency toward historic lows. 
Bolsonaro, a former army captain who favors easing gun controls, shot ahead early in the race by tapping the anger of Brazilians fed up with political corruption and rising crime. 
The most divisive election since the end of Brazil's military rule three decades ago has become increasingly polarized between right and left, raising concerns about the future of the country's democracy.

Bolsonaro, an admirer of Brazil's 1964 to 1985 military regime, has accused the Workers Party of trying to rig the elections. His running mate, retired General Hamilton Mourão, has said the armed forces should carry out a coup if the country's judiciary cannot end political corruption.

UNITED NATIONS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Chinese government's top diplomat, Wang Yi, said on Friday there was ""no cause for panic"" over friction between Beijing and Washington, but warned that China would not be blackmailed or yield to pressure over trade.
At a U.N. Security Council meeting on Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump escalated tensions with Beijing by accusing it of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections to stop him and his Republican Party from doing well because of his China trade policies. At the same meeting, Wang rejected the charge.
""Protectionism will only hurt oneself, and unilateral moves will bring damage to all,"" Wang said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Friday.
""Regarding trade frictions, China stands for a proper settlement based on rules and consensus through dialogue and consultation on an equal footing. China will not be blackmailed or yield to pressure.""
Trump, who accuses China of stealing U.S. intellectual property, limiting access to its own market and unfairly subsidizing state-owned industries, has escalated his trade war with China and U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods kicked in on Monday, prompting Beijing to retaliate with additional tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. products.
Wang earlier told the Council on Foreign Relations in New York that concrete actions had to be taken to maintain relations between the United States and China. 
""The closer our engagement, the more closely entwined our interests, maybe various suspicions and even frictions may ensue,"" Wang said. 
""This is not surprising and it is also no cause for panic. What is important is how these differences should be viewed, evaluated and handled.""
Wang, who holds the twin titles of foreign minister and state councilor, dismissed any suggestion there was forced technology transfer from foreign firms in China and played down complaints by some U.S. firms about market conditions in China.
""A small number of companies that are not so satisfied may speak up louder, but I don’t think they represent the majority of the companies in the Chinese market,"" he said.
Further cooperation between the United States and China was key in pursuing denuclearization of its ally North Korea, Wang said, while urging the creation of a peace mechanism and for the United States to give North Korea more incentives.
""We believe it is ... right for the U.S. to make timely and positive responses so as to truly meet North Korea halfway,"" Wang said in his U.N. speech.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned members of the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that they must ""set the example"" by enforcing sanctions on North Korea as China and Russia suggested the council consider easing the tough measures because progress had been made.
Wang warned that scrapping the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which China and other powers are fighting to save after Trump pulled out of it in May, could lead to a regional arms race.
He said China was fostering closer economic ties with Russia as the two economies were complimentary and Moscow and Beijing were also on the same page on international issues.
""We want to build a new kind of relationship featuring non-confrontation, non-conflict and no targeting any third country,” he said. “Russia is our largest neighbor, and there’s need for normal and friendly ties between neighbors.
“Certainly, the two economies are highly complementary. We need the Russian energy like oil and natural gas and they need Chinese processed goods ... and inexpensive Chinese goods.”
Wang said China had exercised ""utmost restraint"" in the South China Sea and seeks peaceful solutions to disputes there. He said Beijing's sovereignty over the South China Sea islands was ""very clear"" and that people there felt the need for enhanced defenses given ""heavy"" U.S. military patrols, Wang said. 
China claims most of the South China Sea, through which about $3 trillion worth of trade passes every year. Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei also claim parts of the sea, which has oil and gas deposits and rich fishing grounds.
Wang said that while Asia belonged to the people of Asia, China did not seek a closed continent or to create ""a new order"" or hegemony. 

""China will not, repeat, not repeat the old practice of a strong country seeking hegemony,"" Wang said. ""I don’t think China will become the United States and China will not challenge the United States, still less will China take the place of the United States.""

WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The United States and Mexico abruptly canceled plans to publish the text of their trade agreement on Friday to give Canada and the Trump administration more time to resolve their differences and save the North American Free Trade Agreement as a trilateral pact.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said the text was delayed due to a serious attempt by Ottawa and Washington to reach a deal.
""In the next 48 hours we will know if we are going to get to a trilateral text or if we are going to have to put forward the text of the bilateral agreement,"" Guajardo said in televised remarks to the Mexican Senate.
The Trump administration had threatened to proceed with a Mexico-only trade pact as U.S. talks with Canada foundered in recent weeks amid deep differences over Canada's dairy market and a mechanism for settling trade disputes.
The NAFTA text -- either bilateral or trilateral -- is due by late Sunday night to meet U.S. congressional notification requirements to allow U.S. President Donald Trump and outgoing Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to sign the pact by Nov. 30, Pena Nieto's final day in office. 
Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, told reporters in Mexico City that he would insist that all three countries be part of NAFTA and said Washington had made a new counter-proposal to Ottawa.
A spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office declined to comment on the status of the U.S.-Mexico text and the talks with Canada. 
Officials in the offices of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, did not respond to queries about the counterproposal.
Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico City that Trudeau asked him during a Thursday phone call ""to intervene and call on the U.S. government to reach an agreement"" with Canada. ""We agreed to that.""
He said that the NAFTA language between Washington and Mexico City was now final. ""We are not going to re-open the negotiation. That you can be sure of,"" Lopez Obrador said.
One source close to the talks said Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray was also acting as an intermediary between Canada and the United States.
Canada's Liberal government says it does not feel bound by the latest NAFTA deadline, and it repeated on Friday that it would not bow to U.S. pressure to sign a quick deal.
""We are in a very tough negotiation with the United States over NAFTA ... there is no deadline on this. As far as we are concerned we want a deal that is good for Canadians and that's the bottom line,"" Transport Minister Marc Garneau told reporters in Ottawa.
THE IMPORTANCE OF CANADA
Some U.S. Democratic lawmakers said on Thursday after a meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer that they could not support a NAFTA deal without Canada.
""Canada is exceptionally important. I think it would be malpractice, both for economic and political reasons, not to have a major agreement with Canada,"" said Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the tax and trade Senate Finance Committee.
Trump, a Republican who blames the 1994 NAFTA pact for the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs, trumpeted the deal with Mexico as a win for Americans and threatened to close the door on Canada if it did not sign on by Sept. 30. 
Trump also floated slapping auto tariffs on Canada, which could sow disarray in supply chains, take the wind out of the sails of a resurgent Canadian economy and rattle investors already unnerved by an escalating U.S.-China trade war.
The U.S.-Mexico text will flesh out an agreement in principle that aims to rebalance automotive trade between the two countries and update NAFTA with new chapters on digital trade and stronger labor and environmental standards. 
It is expected to conform to details already released on auto rules requiring an increase in regional value content to 75 percent from 62.5 percent previously, with 40 percent to 45 percent coming from ""high wage"" areas, effectively the United States.
Auto industry executives say it is unlikely those targets can be met if Canada is not part of the deal, given supply chains in which parts crisscross NAFTA borders multiple times.
More light is likely to be shed on the enforcement of new labor standards and trade dispute settlement arrangements. The United States has said Mexico agreed to eliminate a system of settlement panels to arbitrate disputes over anti-dumping and anti-dumping tariffs.

The release of the trade deal text starts a months-long process for U.S. congressional approval that will require a lengthy analysis by the independent U.S. international Trade Commission and notification periods before an up-or-down vote.

The ICJ, known as the World Court, said in a statement Palestine argues the 1961 Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations requires a country to locate its embassy on the territory of a host state. While Israel controls Jerusalem militarily, its ownership is disputed.
In December, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the American embassy in Israel relocated from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and the new embassy opened in May. 
The Palestinian suit requests the court “to order the United States of America to withdraw (its) diplomatic mission from the Holy City of Jerusalem.""

The ICJ is the United Nations' venue for resolving disputes between nations. Palestine was recognized by the U.N. General Assembly in 2012 as a non-member observer state, though its statehood is not recognized by either Israel or the United States.

349,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2018 06:30PM ET</span>","Lavrov notes Trump blamed China, not Russia, for U.S. election meddling","UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov took pleasure in pointing out on Friday that U.S. President Donald Trump this week accused China, not Russia, of interfering in U.S. elections.
Trump on Wednesday accused the Chinese government of seeking to influence the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections against his Republican Party. China has denied the allegation.
""This time he blamed China only for interference, he did not mention Russia - well he didn’t mention us before,"" Lavrov told reporters at the United Nations. 
He then smiled and added: ""We are the last people interested in interfering in interior affairs."" 
The Russian foreign minister, a veteran diplomat with a puckish sense of humor, was underlining the fact that Trump has been reluctant to blame Russia for alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election that brought him to the White House.
A January 2017 report by U.S. intelligence agencies found that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered an influence campaign aimed at undermining faith in U.S. democratic processes and hurting Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. It also found that Russia had sought to help Republican Trump's candidacy.
U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether Trump's election campaign colluded with Russia. Trump has denied any such collusion and Russia has denied such interference.

Asked separately if Russia was luring farmers from South Africa, which is weighing whether its constitution needs to be changed to allow land expropriation, Lavrov replied: ""No, this time we are busy with meddling with Catalonia elections,"" prompting laughter. ""No time for this, you know, it's too far.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday Moscow had started delivering the S-300 surface-to-air missile system to Syria and warned Western powers of trying to undermine U.N.-led efforts to end the seven-year conflict. 
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had said on Monday the system would be delivered to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces in two weeks despite strong Israeli and United States objections. A week previously, Moscow had accused Israel of indirectly causing the downing of a Russian military jet in Syria.
""The delivery started already and as President (Vladimir)Putin said, after that incident ... the measures that we will take will be devoted to ensuring 100 percent safety and security of our men,"" Lavrov told a news conference at the United Nations.
Russia, along with Iran, has helped Assad recover huge amounts of lost territory in Syria without persuading him to agree to any political reforms. It has also pushed its own talks with Iran and Turkey, known as the Astana process, as U.N-led peace negotiations have stalled.
Some diplomats have said the Israeli incident and a Turkish Russian deal to suspend an offensive on the last rebel-held stronghold of Idlib could provide a window to push for the implementation of U.N. Security Council resolution 2254 that covers ending conflict in Syria.
The U.N. Security Council, which includes Russia and the United States, has mandated U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura to get a deal on a new constitution, new elections and a reform of Syria's governance.
De Mistura's first task is the formation of a constitutional committee to decide whom to pick. He has said he will select about 50 people, including supporters of the government, the opposition and independents to participate, but so far the Syrian government has rejected the idea.
Meeting in New York on Thursday, foreign ministers from the United States, Egypt, France, Germany, Jordan, Britain and Saudi Arabia called on de Mistura to convene the constitutional committee and report back on progress by the end of October.
Lavrov accused the group of trying to undermine the Astana efforts and putting pressure on de Mistura so that they could impose their own resolution of the conflict, describing it as ""a grave mistake.""

""This is aimed at undermining all that was done at Astana process and not the fact the Syrians decide what country they are going to live in but the architecture agreed on by foreign powers,"" Lavrov said.

(Reuters) - The number of Indians arrested for illegally entering the United States has nearly tripled so far in 2018, making them one of the largest groups of illegal aliens apprehended, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said on Friday.
Paying smuggling rings between $25,000-$50,000 per person, a growing number of Indians are illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and claiming asylum for persecution, CBP spokesman Salvador Zamora said.
Many present viable claims, but a large number are economic migrants with fraudulent petitions that swamp the system and can cause legitimate cases to be ""washed out"" in the high volume of fraud, Zamora said in an interview.
The Indian embassy in Washington and the Indian consulate in San Francisco did not respond to requests for comment.
Zamora said the CBP expects that the data for the fiscal year that ends on Sept. 30 will show ""around 9,000"" Indian nationals had been apprehended versus 3,162 in fiscal year 2017. 
Around 4,000 Indians who entered the United States illegally this year did so over a three-mile stretch of border fence at Mexicali, Zamora said. 
""The word got out that Mexicali is a safe border city which favors their crossing into the United States,"" he said.
CUT AND PASTE EVIDENCE
Asylum seekers range from lower caste ""untouchable"" Indians facing death threats for marrying outside their class to Sikhs claiming political persecution, immigration lawyers said.
Fraudulent asylum seekers often present ""cut and paste"" evidence identical to that of other migrants, Zamora said.
Some 42.2 percent of Indian asylum cases were denied between fiscal years 2012 to 2017, according to Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. That compares with denial rates of 79 percent for El Salvadorans and 78 percent for Hondurans.
After Mexicans, citizens of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were most likely to enter the United States illegally in 2018, according to Border Patrol data. Indians still have some way to go to outnumber the roughly 30,000 El Salvadorans who entered the United States illegally in 2018, the data showed.
After being held in the United States, Indians are often bonded out of detention by human trafficking rings, Zamora said. They then enter indentured servitude in businesses ranging from hotels to convenience stores to pay off smuggling debts and bond fees, Zamora said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A proposed regional security alliance bringing together the United States, Gulf allies, Egypt and Jordan, is at risk of credibility if a Gulf dispute is not resolved, Qatar's foreign minister said on Friday.
Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut off travel and trade ties with Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of backing their archrival, Iran, and supporting terrorism. Qatar denies the charges and says the boycott impinges on its sovereignty.
The United States has tried, without success, to mediate in the dispute. It is an ally of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, and Qatar is home to a major U.S. air base.
The Middle East Strategic Alliance (MESA) is meant to serve as a bulwark against Iran and extremism, Washington says. But it is unclear how it can get off the ground given the dispute.
""Regarding the alliance and the creation of the alliance, by ignoring the GCC rift, we don't think that, even if it's initiated, that it will be initiated effectively,"" Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said in New York. 
""There is a serious challenge among the states and we need to address this challenge, in order also to prove the credibility of this alliance. And we believe there's an opportunity over here,"" he said.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Gulf allies, Egypt and Jordan earlier on Friday where they discussed MESA, in which a ""united GCC"" was emphasized.
""The secretary and the foreign ministers had productive discussions on establishing a Middle East Strategic Alliance, anchored by a united GCC, to advance prosperity, security, and stability in the region,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
The United States was planning to host a summit in October to discuss the plan, but that has been pushed back several months. A senior administration official has said Washington was still planning to hold the summit at a later date.
Speaking to Reuters earlier this week, UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anwar Gargash, called the MESA proposal ""very encouraging"" and one that ""indicates American commitment to the region, its allies and it's extremely important in a very unstable international system.""
But he added that the Gulf dispute was on the ""back burner"", suggesting there were not active diplomatic efforts to resolve the rift and that it would not affect MESA.

""Qatar crisis is on the back burner. It has nothing to do with our ability to present a united front and be a pro-active part of a bigger alliance led by the United States,"" Gargash told Reuters.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States will pursue ""a strategy of isolation,"" including sanctions, with its allies if President Bashar al-Assad holds up a political process aimed at ending Syria's seven-year war, a top U.S. diplomat for Syria told Reuters on Friday.
Jim Jeffrey, the U.S. special representative for Syria, said Washington would work with countries in Europe, Asia and the Middle East to impose tough international sanctions if Assad's government failed to cooperate on rewriting the Syrian constitution as a prelude to elections.
""If the regime does that, we believe that then we can go after it the way we went after Iran before 2015 - with really tough international sanctions,"" Jeffrey said, referring to secondary sanctions against Tehran for its nuclear program.
He added: ""Even if the U.N. Security Council won't pass them we will just do it through the European Union, we will do it through our Asian allies, and then we will make it our business to make life as miserable as possible for that flopping cadaver of a regime and let the Russians and Iranians, who made this mess, get out of it.""
Assad's allies Russia and Iran, as well as China, have made some investments in the country, but they cannot afford the cost of rebuilding and want other countries to share the burden.
Western countries have said they will not approve reconstruction funding for Syria, or drop sanctions, without a political settlement. U.S. sanctions are already making it hard for foreign companies to work there. 
Jeffrey has been charged by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to oversee Washington's role in a political process as a U.S.-led coalition cleans up the last remaining Islamic State militants.
OPENING FOR TALKS
A recent agreement between Turkey and Russia that averted a Syrian army offensive in Idlib, the last major area under rebel control, and the accidental downing of a Russian war plane by Syrian forces was an opportunity to push for the implementation of U.N. Security Council resolution 2254 that covers ending conflict in Syria, Jeffrey said.
The U.N. Security Council, which includes Russia and the United States, mandated U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura to get a deal on a new constitution, new elections and a reform of Syria's governance.
Formation of a constitutional committee was agreed at a Syrian peace conference in the Russian ski resort of Sochi in January. It is up to de Mistura to decide whom to pick and he has said he will select about 50 people, including supporters of the government, the opposition and independents to participate.
The Syrian government at first agreed to the plan, but later rejected it. Its submission of a list of names to the United Nations follows a meeting this month between Assad and his main backer, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin.
Russia has held the balance of power in Syria, both on the battlefield and in the U.N.-led peace talks, for the past two years. It has helped Assad recover huge amounts of lost territory in Syria without persuading him to agree to any political reforms.
But nine rounds of talks, most of them in Geneva, have failed to bring the warring sides together to end the conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven millions from their homes.
CONSTITUTIONAL TALKS
Meeting on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly on Thursday, foreign ministers from the United States, Egypt, France, Germany, Jordan, Britain and Saudi Arabia called on de Mistura to convene the constitutional committee and report back on progress by the end of October.
Jeffrey said Moscow was still in discussions with Russia to use its influence to persuade Damascus to negotiate and allow officials to travel to Geneva for the talks. ""Our feeling is that if he can't we cannot let the Russians hold this thing hostage forever,"" he said.
While an offensive on Idlib was averted, Washington still worries that the Syrian government could use chemical weapons.
President Donald Trump has twice authorized U.S. air strikes against Syrian government targets as punishment for alleged chemical weapons use.
""It is not off the table because the regime is stuck with only half the territory and population of Syria under its control, and the lowest hanging fruit is Idlib because the other areas you deal with the U.S. directly and Turkey directly,"" said Jeffrey.

Israel's military said its troops resorted to live fire, and an air strike, after explosive devices and rocks were thrown at them and to prevent breaches of the border fence from the Islamist Hamas-controlled enclave. 
Gaza health officials said 505 people had been wounded, 89 of them by gunshots. They identified the dead as males, two of them aged 12 and 14. The boys' families could not immediately be reached for comment.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed since the Gaza protests began on March 30 to demand the right of return to lands that Palestinian families fled or were driven from on Israel's founding in 1948, and the easing of an Israeli-Egyptian economic blockade.
Hamas said Friday's protest also marked the 18th anniversary of the launch of the last Palestinian revolt against Israel. 
A Gaza sniper has killed one Israeli soldier and incendiary devices flown over by Palestinians using kites and helium balloons have set off fires that destroyed tracts of forest and farmland in Israel. 
Israel accuses Hamas, against which it has fought three wars in the last decade, of having deliberately provoked violence in the protests, a charge Hamas denies.

More than two million people are packed into Gaza, whose economic plight is a focus of so-far fruitless U.S.-led efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, stalled since 2014.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The families of two Reuters reporters imprisoned in Myanmar have asked for a pardon, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney told a press freedom event at the United Nations on Friday as she pressed the country's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi to agree.
Clooney is a member of the legal team representing Reuters journalists Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, who were convicted on Sept. 3 under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act and sentenced to seven years in prison.
She said the reporters' wives wrote ""a really heartfelt letter"" to the government about a week ago pleading for a pardon, not because their husbands had done anything wrong, but because it would allow them to be released from prison.
Clooney said Myanmar's President Win Myint would make the decision to issue a pardon in consultation with Suu Kyi. 
In a message to Suu Kyi, Clooney told Reuters: ""You fought for so many years to be freed from the same prison where they now sit and now you have the power to actually remedy this injustice today if you wanted to.""
The Myanmar mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay has said the court was independent and followed due process in the case. 
The reporters pleaded not guilty and have been detained since December. Kyaw Soe Oo has a three-year-old daughter. Last month, Wa Lone's wife gave birth to their first child, a girl, whom Clooney said Wa Lone has not yet met.
The reporters had been working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys by security forces and local Buddhists in western Myanmar's Rakhine state during an army crackdown that began in August last year. The operation sent nearly 700,000 people fleeing to Bangladesh.
A U.N mandated fact-finding mission said Myanmar's military carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Muslim Rohingya with ""genocidal intent"" and called for top generals to be prosecuted. Myanmar rejected the findings. 
Suu Kyi said at a forum in Vietnam this month that the case had nothing to do with freedom of expression. She said the reporters had been sentenced for handling official secrets and ""were not jailed because they were journalists.""
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres earlier this month called on the Myanmar government to pardon and release the Reuters journalists as soon as possible.
""This case is about much more than two innocent men,"" Clooney told Reuters after an event hosted by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) on the sidelines of the annual U.N. General Assembly on Friday. 
""If you care about press freedom you care about this case ... Without a free press you cannot have democracy because you don't know how to judge what your government's doing,"" she said. 
The CPJ event also focused on the cases of imprisoned journalists in Egypt, Kyrgyzstan and Bangladesh. Representatives for the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Australia, Lebanon and other countries attended. 

The CPJ said a record 262 journalists were jailed worldwide in 2017, with Turkey, China, and Egypt responsible for imprisoning 134 of those journalists.

BERLIN/DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Turkey aims to win easier access to the European Union for its citizens, President Tayyip Erdogan said in Berlin on Friday during a state visit that aims to repair relations with Germany after bitter disputes.
Turkey would move to meet the EU's criteria for achieving visa liberalization, he said on the second day of a visit also intended to improve ties with the European Union after the freeze that followed a failed coup in 2016.
Facing an economic crisis aggravated by U.S. sanctions, Erdogan is hoping to attract more private investment from the economic superpower on Turkey's doorstep.
""Visa (NYSE:V) liberalization, updating the customs union and reviving accession talks will benefit both Turkey and the EU,"" Erdogan said.
Germany, home to 3 million ethnic Turks and reliant on Turkey to help contain a migrant crisis beyond Europe's borders, is also keen to rebuild ties, yet wariness surrounds the three-day state visit on all sides.
With Erdogan due to continue to Cologne, home to one of the largest Turkish communities outside Turkey, on Saturday, authorities there refused permission for a 25,000-strong spillover crowd to gather outside a giant new mosque that he is due to open.
The regional government also has to rearrange a morning meeting between North Rhine Westfalia's premier Armin Laschet and Erdogan after the ancestral owners of the castle that was to be the venue obtained an injunction preventing his visit.
Ankara is still smarting at what it sees as Europe's slowness to condemn the failed coup against Erdogan in 2016, while Germany and EU countries are concerned about the mass arrests that followed, Turkey's patchy press freedom record and Erdogan's influence over Turkish diaspora communities in Europe.
BERLIN LOCKDOWN
Merkel said she had pushed for the release of German citizens among the tens of thousands of people arrested after the coup, blamed by Ankara on supporters of U.S.-based cleric Fetullah Gulen. Gulen denies involvement.
""We take very seriously the evidence Turkey provided,"" Merkel told a news conference, but said Germany needed more evidence to declare Gulen's movement an illegal group as Ankara demands.
Newspaper Bild reported that Erdogan had been ready to call off the news conference if it was attended by Can Dundar, a journalist who fled Turkey into German exile after spying charges were brought against him.
In the event, Dundar stayed away, saying he did not want to give Erdogan an excuse ""not to appear at the press conference and face critical questions from my German colleagues.""
Erdogan had earlier described the former editor of Cumhuriyet newspaper - which published a video purporting to show Turkey's intelligence agency trucking weapons into Syria - as a ""spy"" who should be extradited to serve time. Dundar rejected that accusation.
The day was punctuated by protests, starting when a participant in the news conference wearing a T-shirt with the slogan ""Freedom for Journalists"" was bustled out when he tried to shout Erdogan down.
Much of central Berlin was in lock-down for the visit, reflecting nervousness at the divisiveness of a visitor who is hailed a hero by many German Turks and reviled as an autocrat by many others. 

""It is a scandal in the history of this country that it rolls out the red carpet for dictators,"" Left party politician Hakan Tas told a protest demonstration on a central square. ""The day will come when the mass murderer of the Bosphorus will sit behind bars.""

NAIROBI (Reuters) - A group of Kenyan tea plantation workers have written to the chief executive of  Unilever  (LON:ULVR) saying they had warned the firm's local managers they would be caught up in ethnic violence after a disputed election in 2007, before being hunted and attacked.
The survivors, whose letter was seen by Reuters, want their case for compensation heard in Britain and are seeking permission to appeal to Britain's Supreme Court.
Unilever has said the scale and intensity of the violence that broke out after Kenya's disputed vote and which killed an estimated 1,200 nationwide was not foreseeable.
A spokesman for the Anglo-Dutch company said he could not comment on the letter as court proceedings were pending.
A legal battle over the issue, one of several attempts to hold British multinationals liable for alleged actions of their subsidiaries abroad, has been winding through English courts since 2016.
Law firm Leigh Day said it was representing 218 workers, including the families of seven workers who were killed during the violence and 56 female workers who say they were raped.
A group of current and former Kenyan employees told Unilever CEO Paul Polman in their letter that they raised their fears with local managers before violence broke out near the company's tea plantation.
""All they said was that we should go and hide in the tea bushes, and that is where many of us were hunted and attacked. No one came to rescue us,"" the letter dated Sept. 25 said.
Without commenting on the letter, the Unilever spokesman said: ""Unilever wholeheartedly rejects any allegation that the violence was foreseeable or that the company should ever try to take over state responsibility by retaining the kind of armed military force necessary to intervene in such situations.""
An English High Court judge in 2016 ruled in favor of Unilever, saying it could not have foreseen that widespread violence would break out in the area near its farm.
CORE, a British civil society coalition that advocates for corporate responsibility, said the parent company had ""responsibility to ensure standards throughout the business.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) - A tsunami caused deaths when it hit a small city on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday after a major quake, collapsing buildings and cutting off power, officials said, although the exact number of casualties was not clear.
The tsunami up to 2 metres (six feet) high struck beaches as dusk fell in Palu, a sleepy but growing tourist resort, and the nearby fishing town of Donggala, closest to the epicenter of the quake 27 km away, officials said. 
""The earthquake and tsunami caused several casualties ... while initial reports show that victims died in the rubble of a collapsing building,"" National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told reporters. ""The number of casualties and the full impact is still being calculated."" 
Sutopo said the disaster caused a power outage that cut communications in Donggala and surrounding areas. The Communications Ministry is working to repair 276 electricity base stations.
Officials said aftershocks, the communications breakdown and the power outage made it hard to coordinate rescue efforts.
More than 600,000 people live in Palu and Donggala.
""The 1.5- to two-meter tsunami has receded,"" Dwikorita Karnawati, who heads Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency, BMKG, told Reuters. ""The situation is chaotic. People are running on the streets and buildings have collapsed. There is a ship washed ashore.""
BMKG had earlier issued a tsunami warning but lifted it within the hour.
Amateur footage shown by local TV stations, which could not immediately be authenticated by Reuters, showed waters crashing into houses along Palu's shoreline, scattering shipping containers and flooding into a mosque in the city.
The national search and rescue agency will deploy a large ship and helicopters to aid the operation, said agency chief Muhammad Syaugi, adding he had not been able to contact his team in Palu. 
The armed forces and police will also provide troops and equipment to support the emergency response, officials aid.
Oil company Pertamina said its fuel depot in Donggala had been damaged in the incident though there was no oil spill. Fuel tanks had shifted in the quake and ship loading facilities were disabled among other damage.
There were no reports of damage to producing oil and gas fields in the area, according to the energy ministry.
Palu, hit by a 6.2 magnitude quake in 2005 which killed one person, is a tourist resort at the end of a narrow bay famous for its beaches and water sports. 
In 2004, an earthquake off the northern Indonesian island of Sumatra triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean, killing 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.
Some people took to Twitter saying they could not contact loved ones. ""My family in Palu is unreachable,"" Twitter user @noyvionella said.
Palu airport was closed.
The area was hit by a lighter quake earlier in the day, which destroyed some houses, killing one person and injuring at least 10 in Donggala, authorities said.
The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the second quake at a strong 7.5, after first saying it was 7.7. 
""Aftershocks are still continuing,"" Nugroho said.
""Communication has been crippled at this time, causing difficulties in coordination and reporting with the region.""
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.

A series of earthquakes in July and August killed nearly 500 people on the holiday island of Lombok, hundreds of kilometres southwest of Sulawesi.

The experts' joint statement, unusual for attracting such a large number of signatories, named activists who had been detained for months, highlighting the case of women's rights campaigner Amal Fathy.
Her verdict will be announced on Saturday, on charges of ""incitement to overthrow the regime, terrorism, and publishing fake news in relation to her efforts to promote women’s rights"", the U.N. statement said.
""We are gravely concerned at the human rights defenders’ prolonged periods of detention, reportedly arising from their peaceful and legitimate defense of human rights,"" they said.
The 17 independent experts all investigate rights for the U.N. Human Rights Council, which wrapped up a three-week session on Friday without any scrutiny of Egypt.
""The systematic targeting of human rights defenders is yet another indication that the Egyptian Government is operating a zero-tolerance approach to dissent, which is often suppressed under the pretext of countering terrorism,"" they said.
Egyptian officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on their statement.
Earlier this month Amnesty International, a human rights charity, said Egypt had become an ""open-air prison"" under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
Sisi's supporters maintain the president has been trying to combat an Islamist insurgency and restore order to the country following years of chaos after Arab Spring demonstrations ousted President Hosni Mubarak in 2011.

Weekly news magazine Veja, citing court documents, reported that Bolsonaro's second wife accused him in 2008 in an acrimonious divorce filing of stealing nearly 1 million reais ($250,000) in cash and jewelry as well as underreporting his assets to electoral courts.
Reuters could not immediately verify the allegations.
""Once again, the usual parts of the media launch their latest attacks in a vain attempt to take me down,"" Bolsonaro said on Twitter. ""For years, they have tried to stop us with false criminal labels and distorted half truths.""
The former Army captain did not address the specific accusations in the news report.
Bolsonaro, who is in hospital recovering from a knife attack sustained while campaigning, could not immediately be reached by Reuters for comment.
When asked about the accusations against Bolsonaro, his media representative replied by questioning the political affiliations of a journalist involved in the report.
The allegations strike at the electoral strengths of the far-right congressman and frontrunner in opinion polls, who has pitched himself as a warrior against corruption in the capital Brasilia, where he has served for nearly three decades.
Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index slipped 0.6 percent in midday trading, as traders cited the Veja report and a poll on Friday suggesting Bolsonaro could eventually lose the race to leftist Workers Party candidate Fernando Haddad.
Brazilian markets have moved in tandem with Bolsonaro's electoral prospects in recent weeks, as many investors see him as the best chance to keep the Workers Party from returning to power after a devastating recession.
Veja reported that Bolsonaro's former wife, Ana Cristina Siqueira Valle, presented his income tax filing as evidence in their divorce proceedings and filed a police report at the time regarding the alleged theft from her bank safe.

Valle, who is running for Congress, told Veja that she had made exaggerated claims during the divorce and preferred not to comment on the case.
Earlier this week, Valle denied a Folha de S.Paulo newspaper report, citing diplomatic cables, that she had fled Brazil for Norway in 2008 because of death threats from Bolsonaro, which he also denied.

364,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>","Once an outcast, Ukrainian Patriarch ready to lead church split from Russia","By Matthias Williams and Pavel Polityuk
KIEV (Reuters) - Patriarch Filaret was defrocked and excommunicated by the Russian Orthodox church, and accused by his opponents of being a KGB agent, having a secret family and embezzling money. 
But more than a quarter of a century after he led a split of the Ukrainian church from its Russian parent following the Soviet Union's collapse, Filaret, now 89, is close to achieving his dream of an independent national church. And he is ready to lead it.
Divisions between rival Orthodox factions have sharpened in Ukraine since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the outbreak of a Kremlin-backed separatist insurgency in the eastern Donbass region.
For President Petro Poroshenko, establishing an independent church is a way of blunting Moscow's influence in Ukraine. If he pulls it off, it would also likely boost his chances in a tight re-election race next March. 
For that to happen, Ukraine needs the formal backing of the Ecumenical Patriarch in Turkey, the global spiritual head of Orthodox Christians. 
Filaret said Ukraine could be weeks away from achieving its goal despite fierce opposition from Moscow, and that a synod in Istanbul would approve autocephaly latest by the end of this year. The Russian Orthodox Church has already protested by breaking off ties with Istanbul in September.
""I do not see any obstacles to getting the Tomos,"" Filaret told Reuters, referring to the formal announcement that would grant the Ukrainian church ""autocephaly"", or independence.
It would mark the end of a strange journey for Filaret, who was once a frontrunner to head the Russian Orthodox Church but switched tack to campaign for an independent Ukrainian church as the country won independence from Moscow. 
His branch initially struggled for recognition but has grown in strength and enjoyed the support of successive presidents. He denies allegations of impropriety or working as a secret agent for the KGB, though he said under the Soviet system the clergy was forced to have contacts with the secret police.
Not shy of wading into politics, he threw his support behind ""Orange Revolution"" protesters in 2004 against Russia's choice of president, Viktor Yanukovich. 
During the Maidan street protests that eventually toppled Yanukovich in 2014, his church offered shelter to injured demonstrators. He says Ukraine's place was in Europe, not under President Vladimir Putin's Russia, and has urged the West to keep sanctions on Russia. 
""Putin wants to return to the past, to the period when empires existed,"" Filaret said in an interview. 
""But the period of the empires is over. We have already entered a period of globalization while Putin wants to remain in the period of empires.""
HEIGHTENED TENSIONS
The separatist conflict has heightened tensions between a church aligned with Russian Orthodoxy -- widely referred to in Ukraine as the Moscow Patriarchate -- against Filaret's breakaway rival called the Kiev Patriarchate.
Critics of the Moscow Patriarchate call it a fifth column for the Kremlin, used to harbor separatist fighters, store weapons, justify Russian expansionism and spread anti-Ukrainian propaganda. Critics of Filaret call him illegitimate.
It has led to violent clashes between supporters of the rival factions over church property.
Vladimir Legoida, a spokesman for the Moscow Patriarchate, said one of its churches had been forcibly seized by ""schismatic organizations"" on Friday in western Ukraine, and accused Kiev's leaders of unnecessary meddling. 
""Ukraine's political forces are guided by political ambitions and are trying to somehow change the current political situation, including the president's low rating,"" he said at a news conference in Moscow on Friday. 
Despite his advanced years, Filaret says he is fit enough to lead the new autocephalous church if chosen, something he puts down to a moderate diet and looking after his health. 
But the Moscow Patriarchate says there can be no compromise with Filaret in charge, and its supporters have warned of bloodshed if Ukraine completes its break from Russia. 
""If I fought for 26 years for the autocephaly of the Ukrainian church and believed that it would happen then of course, as long as God gives me strength, I will serve the Ukrainian church till the end,"" Filaret said. 
""There will be provocations and we anticipate them, but we will do everything according to the law, voluntarily and without any violence.""
Poroshenko is widely expected to run for a second term next year, and Filaret credits the president's diplomatic efforts as part of God's plan to give Ukraine an independent church. He also thinks it will give Poroshenko a boost at the polls. 

""Whether he wants to go for a second term or he doesn't, but the fact that his authority will rise in Ukraine is without a doubt,"" Filaret said.

He said it was likely Russian ""special services"" were behind the attack, which he believed had been meant to warn him off investigating the killing of three Russian journalists in the Central African Republic.
Verzilov, who runs an online news portal with close ties to punk protest group Pussy Riot, was flown to Germany for urgent treatment after falling ill two weeks ago in Moscow.
""They agree that it was a specially projected poison,"" Verzilov told Reuters in an interview in a central Berlin flat. 
He said the doctors still had not identified the substance that had poisoned him.
""We think that the whole idea of the attack in Africa, it being a kind of warning, is the most plausible position here.""
Ten days ago, doctors at Berlin's Charite hospital said he was suffering from anti-cholinergic syndrome, a condition in which the passage of certain neurotransmitters is blocked, the sudden onset of which was strongly indicative of poisoning.
""It is highly probably that he was poisoned,"" said Kai-Uwe Eckardt, the doctor treating him.

Verzilov had been working with the three reporters, affiliated with the TsUR online news outlet, who were ambushed and killed on July 30 as they investigated the activities of clandestine Russian private military contractors known as the Wagner Group.

Venezuelans have been pouring into countries across the region to escape food and medicine shortages and a deep economic crisis. Colombia, which shares a porous eastern border with the socialist-run country, has borne the burnt of the arrivals.
Nearly a million Venezuelan immigrants are living in Colombia, Duque said after a meeting with Jorge Familiar, the vice president of the World Bank.
""The fiscal impact that the migration crisis has could be about 0.5 percent of GDP, obviously we want to look at how that's reflected in health, in education, in infrastructure, in lots of public assets,"" said Duque.
The World Bank will release a report on the fiscal and social impact of the crisis on Colombia in the coming weeks, Familiar said.
""This is a regional issue and it requires a regional answer,"" Familiar said. ""We've created the report which will be presented in tandem with some agencies from the United Nations, those that deal with migration and refugee issues.""
Since 2015, more than 1.6 million Venezuelans have left their country, with 90 percent arriving in neighboring South American countries, according to the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR.
Affected countries have repeatedly asked for more aid to help them cope with migrants' needs.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and other top officials of the ruling Socialist Party have dismissed those migration figures as stemming from politically motivated alarmism and ""fake news"" meant to justify foreign intervention in the country's affairs.

Denmark's armed forces said they took part in the operation, without giving details. Danish police said they were still looking for a Swedish-registered rental car, and Swedish police said the car was rented at Malmö airport in August but hadn't been returned.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The Nobel Foundation could drop the Swedish Academy from awarding its prestigious annual literature prize if the Academy does not make further changes in the wake of a recent sex scandal, the head of the foundation told Reuters on Friday.
""If things continue in this way, and if they don't manage to regain legitimacy, then we might be forced to take drastic steps,"" Lars Heikensten said.
""One of those steps could be asking permission to have some other organization being responsible for the prize.""
(Graphic: Nobel Laureates interactive - http://tmsnrt.rs/2y6ATVW)
The Academy is working to rebuild its reputation after a sex scandal involving the husband of one its members. The incident prompted some of the Academy's 18 members to quit. 
It also forced the Academy to postpone the awarding of the 2018 Nobel Prize for Literature. 
The husband, Jean-Claude Arnault, has repeatedly denied any wrong-doing.
Heikensten said the Academy had taken its first positive step by agreeing on a reinterpretation of its bylaws to allow it to deal with issues including the need to hire several new members and remove others.
""They need to look at the composition of the Nobel committee, those who are most involved with the prize, so that the committee consists of people who are competent and have not been involved in a negative way with what has happened,"" he said.
He expressed reservations when asked if enough had been done since the scandal.
""I think (agreeing on the bylaws) was a step in the right direction, but they still have several steps to take. So things don't look that good,"" Heikensten said.
In addition to members resigning, several others, including Arnault's wife, are not taking part in the Academy's work as a consequence of the row.
Heikensten said he believed it would be good if more members of the Academy resigned, but he declined to elaborate.
In a normal year, the Academy would be set to begin work to select the 2019 prize winner, however this year's troubles have put that process on ice.
Heikensten said that if the Academy could not resolve its problems soon, it would not be allowed to hand out the 2019 literature prize.
""We certainly hope that the Swedish Academy will be able to give out the (literature) prize in 2019 and we're working as hard as we can on that,"" he said.

""But if things are not dealt with properly reasonably soon... most likely, in that case, there will be a postponement again but that would be very unfortunate.""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has defrocked a 88-year-old Chilean priest who sexually abused teenage boys over a period of many years and is at the center of a wider abuse scandal that is still under investigation, the Vatican said on Friday. 
Father Fernando Karadima was defrocked, or ""reduced to the lay state"" by the pope on Thursday, a move the Vatican called ""exceptional"" and done ""for the good of the Church"".
Karadima, who lives in a home for the elderly in the Chilean capital Santiago, was notified on Friday.
He was found guilty in a Vatican investigation in 2011 and ordered to live a life of ""prayer and penitence"", but was not defrocked at the time, the final years of the reign of former Pope Benedict. That meant he was still a priest, although he could not minister in public.
Karadima, who has always denied wrongdoing, escaped civilian justice because of the statute of limitations in the country.
Seven Chilean bishops have resigned since June after an investigation into an alleged cover-up of Karadima's crimes, some of them former proteges of Karadima, who prepared them for the priesthood as young men in Santiago's up-scale, conservative El Bosque neighborhood.
Three Chilean men who said they were abused by Karadima accused one, Juan Barros, the former bishop of Osorno, of having witnessed Karadima abuse them.
During a trip to Chile in January, the pope said he had no proof against Barros, believed he was innocent, and that accusations against him were ""slander"" until proven otherwise.
But days after returning to Rome, the pope, citing new information, sent sexual abuse investigator Archbishop Charles Scicluna of Malta to Chile to speak to victims, witnesses and other Church members. 
Scicluna produced a 2,300-page report accusing Chile's bishops of ""grave negligence"" in investigating the allegations and said evidence of sex crimes had been destroyed.
In April, Francis, who is also grappling with sexual abuse crises in the United States, Germany and Australia, held four days of meetings in Rome with the three victims - Juan Carlos Cruz, James Hamilton and Jose Andres Murillo.
""I have a knot in my stomach. I never thought I would see this day,"" Cruz said in a tweet thanking the pope. ""He (Karadima) is criminal who has ruined so many people’s lives with his abuse. I hope thousands of survivors feel a bit of the relief I feel today.""

Following the meeting with the victims, Francis summoned all of Chile's 34 bishops to Rome in May and they offered their resignations en masse. Francis has so far accepted seven, and appointed ""apostolic administrators"" to run their dioceses.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged Myanmar's government to take concrete steps to investigate human rights abuses against Rohingya Muslims and hold accountable members of its security forces and others for any involvement in those actions, a State Department official said on Friday.
Pompeo gave the message at a meeting with Myanmar government minister Kyaw Tint Swe on Thursday at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, after the recent release of U.S. and U.N. reports chronicling atrocities in the military crackdown last year, which sent almost 700,000 minority Rohingya Muslims fleeing to neighboring Bangladesh.
The State Department report issued earlier this week accused Myanmar's military of waging a ""well-planned and coordinated"" campaign of mass killings and gang rapes but stopped short of describing it as genocide or crimes against humanity. 
U.N. investigators issued a report in late August accusing Myanmar’s military of acting with ""genocidal intent"" and calling for the country’s commander-in-chief and five generals to be prosecuted under international law.
Pompeo ""urged the government of Burma to take concrete steps to investigate the human rights abuses chronicled by the U.S. Documentation Report and UN Fact Finding Mission and to hold accountable members of the security forces and others responsible for these acts,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in Friday’s statement.
He also reiterated U.S. calls for Myanmar to immediately free two jailed Reuters reporters, according to a State Department summary of the meeting, which was seen by Reuters before its expected release on Friday.
The military in Myanmar, previously known as Burma, where Buddhism is the main religion, has denied accusations of ethnic cleansing and says its actions were part of a fight against terrorism.
Some U.S. lawmakers and human rights groups have pressed Pompeo to make a declaration of genocide to intensify pressure on Myanmar. While U.S. officials have not ruled this out in the future, some in the Trump administration are wary that it could have legal implications of committing Washington to stronger punitive measures against Myanmar.
In calling for the release of Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, Pompeo told Kyaw Tint Swe, minister of the office of the state counselor, that Myanmar must “strengthen and protect freedom of expression and the press.”
The two men were convicted on Sept. 3 under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act in a case seen as a test of democratic freedoms in Myanmar. 

The reporters, who pleaded not guilty, had been investigating the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys by security forces and local Buddhists amid the military response to insurgent attacks last August.

372,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",Russian trips to Syria hit peak after Putin ordered partial pull-out,"By Maria Tsvetkova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The number of Russian civilians traveling to Syria, where Moscow is running a military operation in support of President Bashar al-Assad, reached record levels this year, according to official figures published by a Russian security service.
The data does not include Russian servicemen or explain what the civilians are doing in Syria.
But the figures shed some light on the scale of Russian activities in Syria because they appear to include civilian personnel working for the military and may also reflect the presence of private military contractors who, according to people familiar with the deployment, are fighting in Syria in support of regular Russian troops.
The number of Russian civilian trips to Syria grew after President Vladimir Putin announced a partial withdrawal of troops last December, an increase apparently indicating an expansion of Moscow's activities in the country.
The numbers of departing Russian citizens are counted by destination countries and are published every quarter by the Federal Security Service (FSB), which supervises border guards, on a government statistical website.
In the first half of this year the FSB registered more than 17,000 departures by Russians to Syria, more than in any six-month period since the Russian operation began in September 2015.
There were nearly 22,000 departures in the whole of 2016 and more than 25,000 in 2017. The number of Russians traveling to Syria may be less because some may make several trips. The FSB has published no data on Russians returning from the country.
Late last year, Putin flew to Syria to announce mission accomplished and to order the withdrawal of ""a significant part"" of Moscow's military contingent. Russia does not disclose how many troops it has in Syria.
In August, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said more than 63,000 Russian servicemen had earned combat experience in Syria since 2015, but troop rotation means the size of the deployment remains unclear.
The number of civilian trips from Russia to Syria has risen more than 10 times since Russia started preparations for its Syria operation in mid-2015. Putin announced the Russian deployment on Sept. 30 of that year.
Only about 1,800 Russians traveled to Syria in each of 2013 and 2014. The first half of 2015 was no different, but the number of departures grew five times just before the official start of the operation and doubled again after it began.
The number of Russian tourists going to Syria has hardly changed in the last five years, numbering just dozens per year.
The Kremlin, the Defence Ministry and the Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment.
WORKING TRIPS
The data on Russia civilian trips to Syria is publicly available but has not been previously reported.
Thousands of Russian private military contractors travel privately to Syria, multiple sources familiar with the deployment have told Reuters. They have civilian status although they cooperate with the military command.
Russian officials deny involvement in the contractors's activities, saying volunteers from Russia can fight in Syria on their own.
Departures to Syria are categorized according to the purpose of visits. Most Russian civilians go on ""working trips"", ""private trips"" or as ""transport support personnel"". 
The headings do not refer to private military contractors. However, friends and relations say the contractors are civilians and Reuters reporters have observed groups of them traveling to Syria from a civilian airport in Russia that has international departure and passport control procedures. 
The Russian army makes wide use of civilian personnel, and commanders of military units, as well as other senior military officials, can employ them, according to an order published on the Defence Ministry website.
The number of trips made by transport support personnel
reached its highest level - 1,678 departures in three months - in the first quarter of this year.
Most people listed travel by air, although the numbers traveling by sea are rising.
Russian civilians made 868 trips by sea in the first half of this year, compared to 1,053 trips during the whole of last year and 59 in 2016.

The FSB data is unlikely to include Russians going to Syria to fight against the government because, as several fighters have told Reuters, they enter Syria illegally from Turkey. The data only captures direct travel between Russia and Syria.

""The new house will be better than this, but we grew up here. It feels strange,"" says Lipovehnch Bucurestean, 21, heavily pregnant with her second child.
Her toddler son picked through old toys strewn around their make-shift house as the Red Cross arrived to transport the family and their belongings to their new home.
Meanwhile, scrap collectors from another Roma community arrived in search of leftovers before bulldozers finished the three-day demolition.
The ""Gallinero"" or ""chicken coop"" had stood on the side of a motorway leading out of the capital since the early 2000s, a fragile mass of corrugated roofs, mangled wires and rotting garbage.
But some residents were uneasy with relocation plans outlined by authorities last year which include social housing and temporary shelters around the capital.
One of the relocated families, the Stans, will rent a state-owned flat in southern Madrid at a subsidized 75 euros ($86.80) a month.
The house is well-equipped and clean, in contrast to the fiber-board walls and open sewage gutters at the campsite. Still, the family said they felt unsettled and had already heard neighbors express reservations about their arrival.
""Mum cried when we left the camp,"" said Beatriz, one of nine children at the flat, as volunteers helped set out their furniture.
Her parents arrived in Spain from Țăndărei, Romania, 17 years ago and had lived in the Gallinero for most of their time since. ""She's scared someone will take us,"" Beatriz said.
""We aren't dirty,"" said Dayana, 6, hinting at the prejudice her family have sometimes faced outside of their tight-knit Roma community.
There are around 725,000-750,000 ethnic Roma living in Spain, according to the charity Minority Rights, making it one of the largest communities of its kind in Europe.
Roma from Romania make up a significant part of that number and, as Europeans, are permitted to live and work in Spain without visas.

Kuciak had, among other things, investigated fraud involving businessmen with Slovak political ties, and the suspected mafia links of Italians with businesses in Slovakia.
A prosecutor said in March the murder was likely to have been a contract killing related to Kuciak's work.
The state prosecutor was due to ask a judge to allow the suspects to be held in custody, the spokeswoman for the state prosecutor's office said in an emailed statement. 
The suspects were detained in a house raid on Thursday morning. Five others detained in the same raid were released, the spokeswoman added.
Kuciak's final story, published posthumously, reported on an Italian living in Slovakia with past business links to two Slovaks who later worked in the office of then-prime minister Robert Fico.
Both of the Slovaks resigned, but deny connections to the murder. Their Italian former business partner has also denied having connections with the mafia and the murder, but was detained on a European drug trafficking warrant in March and extradited to Italy in May.
Weeks of public protests in March eventually forced the departure of the long-serving Fico and his interior minister, Robert Kalinak, as well as police chief Tibor Gaspar.

However, Fico's three-party coalition has remained in power under Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini, who comes from the Smer party, which Fico still heads.

That has been a major bone of contention with Brussels, which has been pushing to wrap up a treaty by the end of the year. Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis had told parliament on Thursday that talks had not made enough progress so far to clinch a deal due to differences over rules to protect Swiss wages from cross-border competition.
In a sign of good faith, the government said it would ask parliament to approve another 1.3 billion Swiss francs ($1.33 billion) in aid to EU member states although it said key issues in bilateral ties remain outstanding.
These include the European Commission's threat not to extend beyond this year recognition of Swiss stock exchange rules that allow cross-border trading, which could touch off tit-for-tat escalation.
Should treaty talks fail -- and the window is closing fast with elections in Switzerland and for the European Parliament both due next year -- a patchwork of 120 sectoral accords governing economic ties would stay in effect, but bilateral relations would enter a deep freeze.

Failure to strike a deal would mean no increase in Swiss access to the single market, dashing hopes for a new electricity union. It could also endanger unfettered EU market access for Swiss makers of products such as medical devices, if agreements on mutual recognition of industrial standards lapse.

SARAJEVO/TRAVNIK (Reuters) - Bosnia's dire unemployment and corruption problems have been driving its youth abroad for years and many believe the ethnically divisive rhetoric which has dominated the run-up to elections on Oct. 7 means things are about to get worse.
Bosnian Serb presidential candidate Milorad Dodik has been campaigning for greater autonomy and eventual secession of the Serb-dominated region, while Bosnian Croat leader Dragan Covic has called for the creation of a separate Croat-run region. 
These were the issues at the core of the 1992-95 war in which 100,000 were killed. Only the Social Democratic Party candidate Denis Becirevic has made the economy one of the priorities of his election campaign.
Many in Bosnia's business community are in despair. 
""When I turn on the TV and listen to their messages, the only impulse I have is to pack my staff and leave,"" said Snjezana Koepruner, the general manager and majority owner of the GS-TMT metal processing plant in Travnik in central Bosnia.
""But I feel responsible for 327 people who earn their daily bread in this firm,"" said Koepruner. Her company, which exports metal parts to the industries across Europe, is one of the most desirable employers in Travnik where larger, pre-war companies are struggling to survive. 
A lack of reliable polls and accusations of electoral fraud and irregularities ahead of the vote are making predictions of the outcome difficult. But analysts see the Oct. 7 vote as a crossroads for Bosnia at which it will either pursue its path towards European Union membership and NATO integration, or held back by its ethnic rivalries.
""These are key elections because all political trends since 2014 until today were negative, incorporating ideas that aim at further disintegration and even dissolution of Bosnia-Herzegovina,"" said Slavo Kukic, a sociology professor at Zenica University in central Bosnia.
""If these political philosophies win the October election, these trends will continue and anything could happen,"" Kukic said.
Bosnia's youth unemployment rate stood at 38.8 percent in July this year, according to official data. Some argue that ruling elite's failure to address joblessness is reflected in Bosnia's emigration statistics. 
About 170,000 Bosnians have left the country since 2013, nearly 5 percent of its population of 3.5 million, according to an NGO campaigning for the return of the diaspora, the Union for Sustainable Return and Integration in Bosnia, which was established for the 1.1 million Bosnians who fled during the war.
""ONE WAY TICKET""
The queues at the Slovenian and German embassies and consulates are getting longer every day, with scores of people - most of them between the ages of 20 to 40 - waiting to obtain work visas.
""It's not so much because of money but because of security,"" Velimir Vujanovic, 29, told Reuters when asked why he was leaving Bosnia for Slovenia. ""There are no prospects here because nobody cares for the young people."" 
Vujanovic, a Bosnian Serb, left his northern hometown of Tuzla during the war and moved with his family to the Serb-dominated part of Bosnia.
About 80 percent of Bosnians said they would go abroad for work, according to a report by recruitment agency Posao.ba recruitment agency. 
Endemic corruption is another factor driving people abroad.
""The people are discouraged by the general social and political situation and worried by the prospect of their children watching bad students get jobs through political and family connections,"" said Adisa Karahodzic, a manager at the leather and textile confectionary producer Koteks Tesanj. 
""We have whole families leaving,"" Karahodzic said. 
Vujanovic, a trained butcher, said he did not see his future in Bosnia and was not planning to return. 

""I've bought a one-way ticket,"" he said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Friday a likeness between a Russian intelligence colonel and a suspect in the Skripal poisoning case does not prove they are the same person, comparing the resemblance to that of impersonators posing as Lenin.
Former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found slumped on a public bench in the English city of Salisbury in March. Britain says they were poisoned with a nerve agent administered by Russian intelligence officers. A woman later died from what British police say was contact with the poison which her partner found in a discarded perfume bottle.
Russia denies any involvement in the affair, which has deepened its international isolation.
Moscow says two Russian men captured on surveillance footage near the scene of the poisoning were tourists visiting Salisbury twice during a weekend trip to Britain, an explanation London says is so far-fetched as to all but prove Russia's involvement. 
Investigative website Bellingcat this week published a picture of a decorated Russian military intelligence colonel it named as Anatoliy Chepiga who resembles one of the men spotted in the surveillance footage.
""We don't know to what extent we can make any formal conclusions about who looks like whom, are they alike, where they lived, where they grew up,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call.
""On Red Square (NYSE:SQ) there are still 10 Stalins and 15 Lenins running around, and they look remarkably like the originals,"" he said, referring to people who dress up as Soviet leaders to pose for photographs with tourists.
Peskov said in order to draw any conclusions, the Russian authorities needed verified information from British officials about the Skripal case, something he said London has been consistently withholding.

""We do not want to participate any more in the propagation of this issue as a partner of the media,"" said Peskov.

PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil (Reuters) - For decades, this southern metropolis stood apart from the rest of Brazil. 
Compared with Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, nevermind troubled cities in Brazil's poor northeast, Porto Alegre enjoyed lower crime and homicide rates, and a reputation for wealth and tranquility. Its residents, most of European descent, prided themselves on a clean, prosperous and progressive hometown.
In recent years, though, Porto Alegre has become more like the rest of Brazil – wracked by recession, political instability and social ills including rising poverty and soaring crime. Porto Alegre's murder rate, fueled in part by the rapid spread of drug gangs, has reached nearly double the national average.
So, just days before a presidential election in Latin America's biggest democracy, people in the city of almost 1.5 million people want drastic change. And in the candidacy of Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right Congressman long considered an outlier from the political fringe, many see what they're looking for.
Over a five-day period in Porto Alegre, Reuters interviewed dozens of voters, local politicians, state officials and public security experts to understand support for a candidate most Brazilians once considered unthinkable as their president.
""Bolsonaro has some good proposals,"" said Tiago Da Silva, a 26-year-old bakery employee who was robbed at knife point near his work late last year. His biggest concern: ""The security situation.""
While polls vary, support for Bolsonaro in Porto Alegre and across Brazil's south remains higher than anywhere else in the country – reaching 30 percent of likely voters in projections for a first-round vote Oct. 7, according to a survey this week by pollster Ibope.
The poll showed Fernando Haddad, a leftist, gaining ground and indicated that Bolsonaro would likely lose against him and other opponents in an Oct. 28 runoff.
Capitalizing on a political career largely untainted by graft accusations – no small feat in a country roiled by corruption scandals – Bolsonaro has garnered growing support with proposals and incendiary statements that in better times would have been electoral non-starters.
Among other measures, Bolsonaro wants to loosen gun laws, overhaul popular social welfare programs and privatize state-run enterprises. On the campaign trail, the 63-year-old former army captain has spoken fondly of Brazil's two-decade military dictatorship, which ended in the mid-1980s.
In three decades as Congressman for the state of Rio, he has espoused views widely considered sexist, racist and homophobic. He has defended torture, suggested the assassination of a former president, told a fellow Congresswoman that she ""didn't deserve"" to be raped by him and said that Afro-Brazilian descendants of slaves ""aren't good enough even to procreate.""
""CAN'T TAKE THIS ANY LONGER""
Despite uproar from critics, Bolsonaro refuses to apologize for any of it, delighting passionate supporters who refer to him as ""a legend"" and regularly mimic his trademark trigger salute.
Earlier this month, an assailant stabbed Bolsonaro at a campaign rally, inflicting a near-fatal wound for which he is still hospitalized and which may keep him from further campaigning before the first-round vote. Bolsonaro's campaign did not respond to requests for comment for this story.
In Rio Grande do Sul, an agrarian state of which Porto Alegre is the capital, voters have historically split between leftist leanings in the city and conservative influences in sprawling farmland that stretches to Argentina and Uruguay.
Rural voters elect conservative representatives who form part of Brazil's so-called ""bible, bullets and beef"" caucus. The city, meanwhile, gave birth to the ""World Social Forum,"" a progressive gathering established as a counterpoint to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
As fortunes shift across southern Brazil, most major candidates, including Bolsonaro, are looking to tap the growing frustrations there. In addition to frequent visits to Porto Alegre and other southern cities, four presidential candidates, including Bolsonaro, have picked ""gauchos,"" as natives of Rio Grande do Sul are known, as running mates.
Hamilton Mourao, a retired Army general who shares the ticket with Bolsonaro, has enraged critics by suggesting military intervention to end corruption and with talk of curbing civil liberties and rewriting the constitution.
During a visit to Rio Grande do Sul in the days before his stabbing, Bolsonaro told supporters at Porto Alegre's airport that he represented an end to politics as usual. Nodding to the surging crime rates and violence, he vowed to reverse laws that prohibit most Brazilians from owning guns.
""We can't take this any longer,"" he said, as cheers erupted. ""We'll attack this problem of violence by letting law-abiding citizens carry firearms.""
As Brazil slowly emerges from its worst recession in decades, it is struggling with mounting violence. While the downturn and higher unemployment are believed to have fostered upticks in crime, much of the bloodshed is caused by turf wars between fast-growing gangs that control drug routes and other illicit activities.
State governments, responsible for public security, have made little progress slowing a toll that last year reached a record 63,880 reported murders nationwide.
""I AM GOING TO VOTE FOR HIM""
Rio Grande do Sul, where the gangs once were less active, had a 2010 homicide rate of 15.5 per 100,000 people, according to the Brazilian Public Security Yearbook. By 2017, the rate had risen over 70 percent, to 26.7 per 100,000. 
In Porto Alegre, nearly 85 percent of people polled last year considered the city to be ""very violent,"" according to a study by the Secure City Institute, a security research group based in the city. More than half said they supported extrajudicial killings by police.
Set amid gently rolling hills along the Guaiba River, Porto Alegre's pleasant middle-class neighborhoods give way to ramshackle settlements on the outskirts, where gangs prey on locals and exchange gunfire with police and each other. Violence once on the margins now rattles Porto Alegre as a whole.
In late 2016, two gunmen killed an 18-year-old man near the departures lounge of the airport. The execution, blamed by police on a gang dispute, was filmed by security cameras and quickly became a symbol of Porto Alegre's woes.
Local officials say it's no surprise voters want answers fast, especially now that violence in the state, still one of Brazil's wealthiest, resembles that in the rest of the country.
""It's impossible to ignore the reality,"" said Cezar Schirmer, the state's secretary of public security. ""Rio Grande do Sul cannot be considered a different country.""
The frustrations, and consequent support for Bolsonaro's law-and-order candidacy, are voiced at both ends of the economic spectrum.
During a recent visit by the candidate to Expointer, a major agricultural fair, Bolsonaro addressed a gathering of wealthy landowners, jumped on a combine harvester and gladhanded with selfie-snapping fans.
""I can't sleep in my farm because I run the risk of being kidnapped, raped or killed,"" said Wolmar Baptista, a 55-year-old rancher who rose from a meal to applaud as Bolsonaro passed by.
Da Silva, the mugging victim in Porto Alegre, isn't alone in his support for Bolsonaro at the small bakery where he works. Nicholas De Conto, Da Silva's 24-year-old manager, has endured four holdups at the family-run business in recent years.

""I know he says things that are pretty radical,"" De Conto said. ""But if he can put a stop to what is happening I am going to vote for him.""

MANILA (Reuters) - Activists and opponents of Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte called for legal action against him on Friday after he appeared to admit responsibility for extrajudicial killings, in remarks his spokesman said were ""playful"" and misinterpreted.
The mercurial president is the subject of two complaints before the International Criminal Court (ICC) that accuse him of crimes against humanity over thousands of deaths during his bloody anti-narcotics campaign.
Duterte, known for rambling, at times perplexing speeches, apparently conceded that summary executions had taken place during his war on drugs, something he has vigorously denied when accused by rights groups and critics. 
During a routine speech at an oath-taking ceremony for bureaucrats on Thursday, he chided unspecified critics in a tirade about which the context was not clear.
""What is my sin? Did I steal, even one peso? Did I prosecute somebody whom I jailed,"" Duterte said. ""My only sin is the extrajudicial killing,"" he said, without elaborating.
Police have killed more than 4,800 people since Duterte took office in July 2016 and unleashed his anti-drug crackdown.
The government denies activists' allegations that police are exterminating drug users, and say those killed were all dealers who had resisted arrest. 
Police also deny involvement in several thousand other street killings of addicts, blaming the largely unsolved murders on criminals.
U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, Agnes Callamard, called Duterte's remark ""extraordinary"" and said he had effectively admitted to ""imposing unthinkable sufferings on thousands of families, emboldening corrupt policing and destroying the rule of law"".
Opposition Senator Risa Hontiveros said the comment ""establishes his clear and direct accountability for the killings"", while Minar Pimple of London-based Amnesty International, said the ICC should take note, and that an international investigation was urgently required.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said Duterte was being facetious and was hitting back at opponents.
""That's the president being himself, being playful, highlighting the point that he is not corrupt,"" Roque said on radio.
But Brad Adams, Asia director of New York-based Human Rights Watch, said Duterte's remark ""should prod the ICC to speed up its consideration of the cases filed against him"".
The ICC launched a preliminary examination this year, prompting Duterte to unilaterally cancel the Philippines' membership of the ICC's founding treaty, saying it sought to portray him as a ""ruthless and heartless violator of human rights"".
Legal experts say the withdrawal was pointless because the ICC's jurisdiction can apply retroactively.

In the same speech, Duterte joked that a tight supply of cheap rice was caused by rehabilitated drug addicts who had regained their appetite.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A gay kindergarten teacher in China is suing his former school after being fired last month, in what his lawyer called a landmark case to test China's protection of minority groups.
The teacher was dismissed in August from a school in the coastal city of Qingdao after he posted on social media about an LGBT event he planned to attend, his lawyer Tang Xiangqian told Reuters. 
The teacher declined to comment or be identified when contacted by Reuters.
Tang said his client was told by the school principal that parents may not want a gay man teaching their children. 
After decades of prudent rule by China's Communist Party, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people are now openly tackling bureaucracy, legal uncertainty and entrenched social norms to assert their place in society.
The teacher was asked to leave without sufficient severance or payment for his 10 percent stake in the school, Tang said.
""The main reason we filed this case is not just as a labor dispute but to make the gay community more visible to a wider group of people. To let more people realize that they can easily be victims of discrimination,"" Tang said.
Chinese labor laws lack specific sections on LGBT issues, but there are broad provisions against discrimination that can be used by minority groups to protect their rights, Tang said.
A court in Qingdao accepted the teacher's case on Thursday.
Tang said, as far as he was aware, it is the first case in China of a gay teacher taking a school to court after being fired over sexual orientation.
The teacher is seeking a court order that he be rehired and paid compensation for his financial losses, according to a copy of the court filing seen by Reuters.
The name of the school and the court were redacted in the court filing. Tang declined to give the names of the court and the school because he said it might affect the case.
Chinese activists have organized rallies to press for greater protections for the LGBT community - and same-sex marriage - to be included in a civil code set to be passed in 2020.
Despite thriving gay scenes in many of China's big cities and growing awareness of LGBT issues, the community has battled against Confucian values and government censorship.

More than two years since the 2016 EU referendum, the United Kingdom, its politicians and its business leaders remain deeply divided over Brexit while Prime Minister Theresa May has yet to clinch a Brexit divorce deal with the EU.
Opponents of Brexit are exploring various ways to stop what they say is Britain's biggest mistake since World War Two.
But Miller, who is leading a campaign to have another referendum, said that if the government manages to successfully navigate an exit deal then politicians must be allowed to focus on domestic issues without the distractions of an ongoing debate about Britain's relationship with Europe.
""Whatever happens at the end of the Brexit process we have got to draw a line under it,"" Miller told Reuters in an interview in an office in Mayfair in central London. 

""Everyone is obsessed. Our bandwidth is completely taken up with Brexit. Our money, our time... We can't carry on like this. We need to make the best of it.""

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria's ruling party narrowly won a key governorship election in southwestern Osun state, officials said on Friday, suggesting the region that helped sweep President Muhammadu Buhari to power will be hotly contested in national polls early next year.
The poll was a re-run after the first vote, held at the weekend, was deemed by the election commission to be inconclusive because the result was within the margin of error when spoiled ballots were factored in to the count. 
The vote had been seen as a test of the ruling party's popularity in the southwest - a region that helped Buhari win the 2015 election. Its backing for Buhari's All Progressives Congress (APC), a merger of four regional parties, proved to be crucial in presidential and gubernatorial races. 
The APC candidate, Adegboyega Oyetola, was announced the winner by the electoral commission with 255,505 votes compared with 255,023 for the candidate representing the main opposition, the People's Democratic Party (PDP). It meant the ruling party retains control of Osun. 
Buhari plans to seek a second term in the February 2019 presidential election which will be a followed a few weeks later by gubernatorial elections. 
""Thank you Osun State for supporting our good governance agenda by re-electing the APC. I assure you that we will continue to work for the progress and prosperity of the state and the nation,"" said Buhari, according to a tweet by his spokesman, Garba Shehu. 
The PDP rejected the result, saying the election had been marred by voter intimidation.
""What we are witnessing in Osun election is that APC is not ready for free and fair elections in 2019,"" Uche Secondus, the PDP's chairman, told journalists in the capital, Abuja, on Thursday while voting was taking place. 
Dozens of lawmakers, including former allies such as the Senate president, have left the ruling party to the opposition in the last few months, threatening Buhari's hopes of securing a second term in the upcoming presidential poll.

General Apirat Kongsompong, 58, belongs to the King's Guard faction in the First Infantry Division of the First Army Region - a group at the very heart of the royalist military establishment.
The relationship between the monarchy, the army and politicians is the fundamental factor determining stability in Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy.
Apirat is the son of General Sunthorn Kongsompong, who led a 1991 coup that triggered a groundswell of opposition from a growing middle class, which resulted in the military's return to barracks in 1992 for 22 years, until the last coup in 2014.
Bangkok's media portrays Apirat as a ""trusted lieutenant"" of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who conducted the 2014 when he was army chief, and as a commander who would prefer to remain aloof from politics.
""I will do my best for the nation and the people,"" Apirat said in a speech before taking up his post.
Prayuth has promised to hold a general election by May under a new constitution that civilian critics say is aimed at limiting the role of political parties while enshrining military influence.
Prayuth has declined to confirm his plans amid widespread media speculation he will seek to stay on in power as an unelected prime minister. He has hinted he could take up a public role after the election.
The election will provide a closely watched test of the popularity of self-exiled former premier Thaksin Shinawatra.
The former tycoon won widespread support in the countryside for pro-poor policies but the animosity of the military-linked Bangkok establishment, which derided his election-winning ways as corrupt vote-buying.
King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who ascended the throne in 2016 following the death of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, appears to have a smooth relationship with the generals running the country.
Apirat's appointment indicated the consolidation of that relationship, said Paul Chambers, a lecturer at Naresuan University and a specialist on the Thai military.
""The army will likely become even closer to the monarchy,"" Chambers told Reuters.

Iran accuses Saudi Arabia and the UAE of funding five gunmen who attacked a military parade in Iran last Saturday and killed 25 people, 12 of them members of the elite IRGC. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have denied any involvement. 
""If you cross our red lines, we will surely cross yours. You know the storm the Iranian nation can create,"" the Fars news agency quoted Brigadier General Hossein Salami, deputy head of the Guards, as saying.
Addressing worshippers attending Friday prayers in Tehran, Salami said in a strongly-worded speech: ""Stop creating plots and tensions. You are not invincible. You are sitting in a glass house and cannot tolerate the revenge of the Iranian nation... We have shown self-restraint.""
Salami also told the United States to ""stop supporting the terrorists or they will pay the price"".
Iran has accused the United States of supporting the assailants who carried out last Saturday's attack. Washington has denied having any prior knowledge of the incident.
The Revolutionary Guards vowed on Sunday to exact ""deadly and unforgettable"" vengeance for Saturday's attack.

Shi'ite Muslim Iran and Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia are arch-rivals in the Middle East and support opposing sides in the Syrian and Yemen conflicts.

Sunni militant groups in southeastern Iran have long carried out periodic attacks on military and civilian targets, aiming to highlight what they say is discrimination against Sunni Muslim ethnic groups in mainly Shi'ite Iran.
In a statement published by state broadcaster IRIB, the Revolutionary Guard said ""Iranian forces killed four terrorists and wounded two. Other members of the terrorist group fled to the neighboring country (Pakistan)"".
No Iranian forces was harmed in the attack, the statement said.
The Guards said the group was linked to the ""world's arrogant power"", without elaborating. Tehran accuses the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia of funding Sunni militant groups, a charge they deny. 
The mainly Sunni province of Sistan-Baluchestan has long been plagued by unrest from both drug smuggling gangs and separatist militants.
Iran says militant groups have safe havens in Pakistan and has warned it will hit their bases there if Islamabad does not confront them.
Security measures have intensified in border areas after an attack on Saturday at a military parade in southwestern Iran in which five gunmen killed 25 people, almost half of them Revolutionary Guards.

""It was supposed to land but instead of landing it was 150 yards short and she went down,"" Jimmy Emilio, general manager of Chuuk Airport at Weno in Micronesia, told Reuters by telephone.
""We don't really know what happened ... people were rescued by boats - 36 passengers and 11 crew were all rescued, only the plane is sinking right now,"" he said.
The Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 aircraft hit the lagoon surrounding the small island about 9.30 a.m. local time (2330 GMT Thursday), Emilio said.
The passengers and crew were taken to hospital, where eight remained, four in a serious condition with bone fractures and other injuries, according to a hospital spokesman. 
""I thought we landed hard until I looked over and saw a hole in the side of the plane and water was coming in,"" passenger Bill Jaynes said in a video posted by the Pacific Daily News website.
""I thought, well, this is not like the way it's supposed to happen,"" he said. Water was waist-deep in the cabin before rescuers arrived, he said.
Video published online by Radio New Zealand and pictures posted on Twitter showed the half-submerged aircraft surrounded by small speedboats.
Air Niugini said in a statement that ""the weather was very poor with heavy rain and reduced visibility at the time of the incident"".
A spokesman for Papua New Guinea's Accident Investigation Commission said investigators would fly to the scene as soon as possible to piece together what happened.

394,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2018 03:23AM ET</span>","In Warsaw's local election, Europe's identity crisis plays out","By Anna Koper and Pawel Sobczak
WARSAW (Reuters) - For would-be Warsaw mayor Patryk Jaki, allowing Muslims into Poland poses a threat akin to the Nazi invasion of 1939. His opponent, Rafal Trzaskowski, agrees the country faces an existential threat, but says it comes from Jaki and his allies.
The two men epitomize the divisions that have riven Poland since the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, in which Jaki serves as deputy justice minister, took power in 2015.
Local elections on Oct. 21 will be the first big contest between PiS and its Europhile Civic Platform opponents since then and its outcome will influence European Parliament elections in May and Poland's next general election in 2019.
It is part of a larger struggle over Europe's future, as Brexit and Hungary's Viktor Orban, a PiS ally, shake up the European Union and right-wing parties make gains across the continent.
While PiS dominates national politics, Civic Platform and its allies still control 15 of Poland's 16 regional assemblies and most of its big cities, giving them a say in issues from who runs a local school or theater to how large EU funds are spent.
Success would let PiS claim popular support for judicial reforms which the EU says undermine the rule of law. The party also opposes abortion, contraception and IVF treatment and wants culture and education to be more conservative.
Warsaw, a bastion of liberalism and scene of protests against political influence over the judiciary, would be the biggest prize.
Jaki, 33, says he sides with ordinary people against what he describes as an arrogant Civic Platform municipal elite.
""Warsaw is ruled today by people who want to say you're inferior,"" he told a cheering crowd this month in front of low-rent apartment blocks. ""I am not ashamed of these blocks. We are not ashamed of this Warsaw.""
He scoffs at what he calls the European Union's ""focus on trivial matters, such as measuring a banana or instructions on how to use wellies"" echoing criticisms leveled by British anti-EU campaigner Boris Johnson that EU officials term ""Euromyths"".
Trzaskowski, 46, a long-time EU emissary for his party, says he wants his native Warsaw to remain ""open, tolerant and European"". Jaki says Trzaskowski is out of touch and that if Catholic Poland goes along with EU plans to distribute asylum-seekers across the bloc it will become Islamised.
""Stopping Islamisation is my Westerplatte,"" he said in an interview with Plus Minus weekly and on Twitter last year, referring to the peninsula where Poland tried to fend off the Nazi invasion that triggered World War Two.
QUEUING FOR TOILET PAPER
Poland joined the European Union in 2004 after decades of Soviet domination and there is little popular appetite for leaving it.
But PiS has zeroed in on deep-rooted fears of foreign meddling and the EU's threat of sanctions over its judicial reforms could boost its support.
Trzaskowski labels PiS and its allies anti-European populists. ""They want to rewrite the history books and question our place in the European Union,"" he told Reuters.
""This is, in a sense, an existential fight.""
Recent polls suggest a close-run race, with around a dozen other candidates far behind Jaki and Trzaskowski.
Jaki belongs to Solidarna Polska, a party allied with PiS, but launched his campaign at the ruling party's convention in September and faithfully echoes its nationalist message.
As a deputy justice minister, he championed a law that made it a crime to suggest Poland was complicit in the Holocaust. He has said Poles should be proud, not ashamed, of their wartime record. Following strong criticism at home and abroad, the law was later watered down by removing the threat of jail terms.
Born in Opole in southwestern Poland, Jaki grew up in a Soviet-era apartment block and presents himself as somebody with lowly origins to project a guy-next-door image.
Supporters of Trzaskowski, who is Warsaw-born, mock Jaki for not being a true Varsovian, as the city's residents are called.
Trzaskowski speaks six languages and holds a doctorate in political science. Jaki's supporters depict him as elitist.
Trzaskowski rejects the characterization. Growing up in Warsaw, ""the only elites were the Communist apparatchiks,"" he says.
""Whether you were the son of a bricklayer or the son of a jazz composer, as I was, we were all brought up in the same neighborhood. We were all standing in queues to buy toilet paper and, on occasion, ham.""
Back at home, and at work, however, his learning is on display. His Warsaw office is lined with floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with works of history. ""All the other books are at home - the literature and so on and so forth,"" he says.
He and Jaki promise Warsaw similar things. Both say they want to improve schools and public transport, fight pollution, build affordable housing and create more green spaces.
But their views on Europe diverge.
Jaki insists he is not anti-Europe. ""We all want Poland to be in the European Union,"" he says. But last year he said the EU was ""looking for an excuse to bash Poland"" because of its leaders' open dislike for Brussels.
On Sept. 2, PiS party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said Poland belongs to the EU but should be careful not to catch its ""social diseases."" The same month, a PiS ally, Poland's President Andrzej Duda, called the EU ""some imaginary community with little bearing on us.""
Trzaskowski, a former MEP, says playing ""the anti-European card"" won't galvanize voters in Warsaw, a city that European money has helped transform. ""They don't want Poland to be on the margins of Europe,"" he says.
""MAKE WARSAW HONEST""
The two men stand on opposite sides of an equally divisive issue: how land and buildings seized by the Nazis and, later, the Communist government, are returned to their pre-war owners.
Poland has never passed legislation to address the issue, triggering multiple lawsuits and allegations of corruption and abuse.
Some Varsovians have been evicted from properties they have occupied for generations. Others have watched developers profit from land their families once owned.
Jaki is chairman of a high-profile committee set up to investigate such irregularities, which he has blamed on opposition politicians and their allies.
Trzaskowski blames ""all the political classes"" for failing to compensate people whose property was seized, and says voters do not associate him with the issue.
But it remains a central theme in his opponent's campaign. In mid-September, escorted by three shaven-headed bodyguards, Jaki spoke in a gritty but gentrifying area called Praga, Warsaw's answer to Brixton or the Bronx.
There, he vowed to rid City Hall of alleged corruption and ""do everything in our power to finally make Warsaw honest"".
Across town, in the upscale Mokotow district, Trzaskowski addressed a home crowd at a local cultural center.
Usually, he says, local election campaigns in Poland are short, but Trzaskowski is steeling himself for a grueling race.
""You need to be where the elections are being fought,"" he says, ""because that's where the fate of Poland will be decided.""

The authorities at the Sabarimala temple, which attracts tens of millions of pilgrims every year, have said the ban was rooted in a centuries-old tradition and is essential to the rites related to the temple's chief deity, Ayyappan.
In some Hindu communities, menstruating women are regarded as unclean, leading to restrictions and in a few cases outright bans on women of child-bearing age from entering certain places.
Lifting the ban, the Chief Justice of India said ""restrictions put by Sabarimala temple can't be held as essential religious practice"".
""No physiological and biological factor can be given legitimacy if it does not pass the test of conditionality,"" Justice Dipak Misra said in the judgment.
It is the latest in a series of controversial judgments by India's Supreme Court concerning some of the most sensitive issues in Indian society.
On Thursday, the court decriminalized adultery and earlier this month scrapped a law banning gay sex.
The temple's authorities said they will appeal to the Supreme Court for a review of the ruling ahead of its next period of opening, beginning Oct. 16.
""We will go for a review petition after getting support from other religious heads,"" said A. Padmakumar, president of Travancore Devaswom Board, which manages the hilltop temple, about 4,000 feet ( 1220 meters) above sea level.
The temple remains open only for 127 days in a year and the approach to it entails difficult paths through a forest.
Justice Indu Malhotra, the lone dissenting judge and the only woman judge in the five-judge bench, said, ""religious practices cannot solely be tested on the basis of the right to equality. It is up to the worshippers, not the court, to decide what is the religion's essential practice"".
Two years ago, a Mumbai court ruled that it was the fundamental right of women to enter any place of worship that allows men access, and that the state should protect this right.
The struggle for equal access to places of worship in India has triggered a wider debate on women's rights in the country.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan braced for high winds and heavy rain as a typhoon roared north on Friday, enveloping outlying islands in high seas before taking aim at the rest of the nation and raking across its biggest main island at the weekend.
Typhoon Trami, rated category 2 by Tropical Storm Risk, with category 5 the highest, is the latest storm to threaten Japan in a year filled with more than the usual number of disasters, including punishing heat, heavy rains and landslides.
Less than a month ago, a typhoon flooded Kansai International airport near Osaka, leaving thousands of tourists stranded.
Outlying islands in the Okinawan chain, some 1,000 km southwest of Tokyo, were being pounded by heavy seas and strong winds, just two days before an Okinawan gubernatorial election, forcing some areas to hold voting early. The central government set up an emergency office to deal with the storm. 
Trami was about 300 km (186 miles) southeast of Miyako island, with winds gusting as high as 216 kilometers an hour (134 mph). 
Churning north across Okinawa on Saturday, Trami is then predicted to rake across the islands of Kyushu and the main island of Honshu on Sunday, a path similar to that taken by typhoon Jebi early in September.
Though the Japanese capital of Tokyo is set for heavy rain, current predictions show it avoiding a direct hit. 
Jebi, the most powerful storm to hit Japan in 25 years, brought some of the highest tides since a 1961 typhoon and flooded Kansai airport near Osaka, taking it out of service for days. 
Seventeen people died in the storm, whose high winds sent trees crashing to the ground and cars scudding across parking lots. 
Even for a nation accustomed to disasters, this year has been hard for Japan, starting with a volcanic eruption in January that rained rocks down on a ski resort, killing one. 
July brought record-breaking heat that killed at least 80 people and sent over 20,000 to hospital for treatment, along with torrential rains in western Japan that set off floods and landslides, killing more than 200.

Just two days after Jebi hit in September, the northernmost main island of Hokkaido was rocked by an earthquake that set off landslides, knocked out power throughout the island and killed at least 44 people.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - Representatives from the Taliban met an Afghan government delegation in Saudi Arabia this week to discuss security ahead of next month's parliamentary elections and a limited prisoner release, three Taliban officials said.
The meeting comes less than a month before voters are due to go to the polls on Oct. 20 to elect a new Afghan parliament, a process which has been hampered by fears of attacks on polling stations and campaign rallies.
Ensuring the election passes off smoothly and without violence has been a top priority for the Afghan government and its international partners.
""They requested us to help them conduct peaceful elections,"" said one of the Taliban leaders.
""The Afghan delegation has agreed with us on the release of prisoners,"" he said, adding that some prisoners facing minor charges had already been released and officials had divided up others into three categories, depending on their importance, for future release.
Both President Ashraf Ghani's office and the U.S. State Department declined to comment. No comment was available from Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban's main spokesman.
The Taliban, who regard the internationally recognized Afghan government as an illegitimate regime imposed by foreign powers, have generally insisted on negotiating only with the United States but there have been regular unofficial contacts.
Earlier this year, Washington dropped its refusal to talk with the Taliban, saying the United States would be willing to participate in Afghan-led peace talks and U.S. and Taliban delegations met for talks in Doha, Qatar, in July.
The meeting in Saudi Arabia came after plans for another meeting with American officials broke down over U.S. demands for a three-month ceasefire, the Taliban representatives said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
""Some of our senior people were not in the favor of holding talks with the Afghan government as until now we were calling them puppets and refused to meet them,"" said one senior Taliban leader in Qatar.
""But our proposed meeting with the Americans failed to take place due to certain reasons,"" he said.
The officials said U.S. demands for a ceasefire was something the leadership could not agree to. As a result, no formal meeting was held although there were informal contacts.
""Our agreement for holding the meeting was only to discuss prisoner exchange and the removal of our people from the UN black list so they can travel,"" said one senior Taliban leader from the movement's political office in Qatar.

As agreed by the two NATO allies in June, Turkish and U.S. forces are now carrying out patrols in Manbij to clear the area of YPG, a group that Turkey views as a terrorist organization linked to Kurdish militants on its own soil.
But Erdogan said YPG forces remain in Manbij, and accused the United States of not holding to commitments under the roadmap agreed in June.
""The United States certainly did not comply with the agreed calendar of the Manbij roadmap; YPG did not exit the area. The real owners of the region are not settled in yet,"" Erdogan was quoted as telling reporters following his recent visit to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly .
""The United States did not keep their promise here."" 
Turkey has been infuriated with Washington's support for the YPG militia and prior to the June agreement it had threatened to push on with a ground offensive against YPG in Manbij despite the U.S. troops stationed.
Before the agreement with Washington, Turkey had carried out two cross-border operations against the YPG in Syria.
Erdogan also said that Turkey was prioritizing the disposal of heavy weaponry held by ""radical"" rebel forces in Idlib in northwest Syria, where Russian and Turkish troops trying to enforce a new demilitarized zone.
""We attach great importance to the disposal of heavy weaponry of radical groups. The majority of burden is on our intelligence agency. The efforts are going well,"" Erdogan said.

Under the plan, the rebels will be required to withdraw from Idlib by the middle of next month.

The 30-minute circuit also features the ""Theresa May Sack Race,"" ""Jacob Rees-Logg lifts"" and ""Politico Headslammer"" in which participants slam balls on to pictures of British Prime Minister Theresa May and opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn. 
There is also a ""Cameron Quitters' Corner"" named after May's predecessor David Cameron to take time out.
The Brexfit classes are being offered by fitness company Gymbox, whose boss Marc Diaper said the theme was chosen by a members' poll of their main frustrations with living in the British capital. 
Fifty two percent of respondents said Brexit, followed by rent prices and train delays.
""We thought well, what better way to actually release frustration and anger than actually put on a Brexfit class as we've called it, where you can actually punch your most hated politician in the face on a punch bag,"" he told Reuters.
The course was designed with the help of an anger management expert, said fitness instructor Boriss Visokoborskis.
""Members are leaving our classes feeling relieved, lighter and they do something good for themselves, they work on their body,"" he added.
Student Ania Jarzabkiewicz, 26, originally from Poland, said she felt ""amazing"" after the class.
""I have a problem to get my student loan because of Brexit, so today I really take out my frustration on this whole situation and I feel really good,"" she said.
Fitness coach George, 25, said his favorite exercises were the sack races and punch bags. In this particular class, leading Brexiteer and former Foreign Secretary Johnson bore the brunt of his frustration.
""It'd be wrong to punch him in the face in real life so ... doing it on a punch bag there's nothing wrong with that, and it's definitely a great way to get your frustration out,"" he said.
With six months until Britain leaves the EU, May has yet to reach a deal on the terms of the divorce, and her plan for future trade ties has been rebuffed by both the EU and many in her own Conservative Party.

Corbyn said this week that Labour would vote against a Brexit deal based on May's proposals, the strongest warning yet to a prime minister whose plan to leave the EU is hanging by a thread.

""Of course, whenever she wants,"" Maduro told reporters when asked at the United Nations if he would accept a mission to report on the human rights situation in Venezuela.
""President Bachelet, the high commissioner, should coordinate with the foreign ministry when she wants to go to Venezuela. She's always welcome,"" he added.
Bachelet, a former president of Chile, took over at the head of the U.N. Human Rights Council on Sept. 1.
Earlier on Thursday, the council said it had approved a resolution expressing serious concern about alleged human rights violations in Venezuela, and urged the country to let Bachelet compile a report on the conditions on the ground.
In a video published by the United Nations, Bachelet said for the Human Rights Council to be able to produce an impartial report on the situation, it was vital to be allowed in.
It would also provide an opportunity for the council to get the ""official version"" from Venezuela's government, she added.

The U.N. Human Rights Council voted on Thursday to establish the body, which will also look into possible genocide in Myanmar's western state of Rakhine.
China, the Philippines and Burundi voted against the move, whose backers said it was supported by more than 100 countries.
Over the last year, more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled the Buddhist-majority country to neighboring Bangladesh following a military response to attacks on security posts by Rohingya insurgents.
The United Nations has called Myanmar's actions ""ethnic cleansing"", a charge Myanmar rejects, blaming Rohingya ""terrorists"" for most accounts of atrocities.
China has close relations with Myanmar, and backs what Myanmar officials call a legitimate counter-insurgency operation in Rakhine. Beijing has helped to block a resolution on the crisis at the U.N. Security Council.
Speaking to Bangladesh Foreign Minister Abul Hasan Mahmood Ali and Myanmar's minister of the office of the State Counsellor Kyaw Tint Swe in New York on Thursday, China's State Councillor Wang Yi said the Rakhine issue was a complex, historical one.

404,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 10:01PM ET</span>","Netanyahu, in U.N. speech, claims secret Iranian nuclear site","By John Irish and Arshad Mohammed
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday described what he said was a secret atomic warehouse in Tehran and accused Europe of appeasing Iran as he sought to rally support for U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Netanyahu showed an aerial photograph of the Iranian capital marked with a red arrow and pointed to what he said was a previously secret warehouse holding nuclear-related material. He argued this showed Iran still sought to obtain nuclear weapons, despite its 2015 agreement with world powers to curb its program in exchange for loosening of sanctions.
Netanyahu spoke 4-1/2 months after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the accord, arguing it did too little to rein in Tehran's nuclear ambitions and triggering the resumption of U.S. economic sanctions on Iran.
Netanyahu said the site contained some 15 kg (33 pounds) of radioactive material that has since been moved, and called on the U.N. atomic agency to inspect the location immediately with Geiger counters.
""I am disclosing for the first time that Iran has another secret facility in Tehran, a secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and materiel from Iran's secret nuclear program,"" Netanyahu said.
The world will laugh at Netanyahu's claims, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said, according to Fars News.
""The world will only laugh loudly at this type of false, meaningless and unnecessary speech and false shows,"" Qassemi said.
Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said that there should be more scrutiny on Israel's nuclear program.
""No arts & craft show will ever obfuscate that Israel is only regime in our region with a *secret* and *undeclared* nuclear weapons program - including an *actual atomic arsenal*. Time for Israel to fess up and open its illegal nuclear weapons program to international inspectors,"" Zarif tweeted.
Israel has pushed the United States toward isolation, Zarif said, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).
""In recent days we've seen how much the policies that Netanyahu has imposed on America has isolated them in the General Assembly and Security Council,"" Zarif said, according to IRNA. ""Now see when they can pull America to this level of isolation how isolated they are themselves.""
Netanyahu did not identify the material nor specifically suggest that Iran had actively violated the nuclear deal. 
An outspoken opponent of the deal, Netanyahu has previously made allegations about Iran's nuclear activities that are difficult or impossible to verify, including presenting a cartoon bomb to the General Assembly in 2012 warning of how close Tehran was to producing a nuclear device.
In April, Netanyahu presented what he said was evidence of a large secret archive of documents related to Iran's clandestine nuclear weapons program at a different site in Tehran.
He said Israeli agents removed vast amounts of documents from that site. At the time, Iran said the documents were fake.
In a speech in which he said relatively little about efforts to achieve peace with the Palestinians, Netanyahu said Iran had since begun moving items out of the second site.
""Since we raided the atomic archive, they've been busy cleaning out the atomic warehouse. Just last month they removed 15 kilograms of radioactive material. You know what they did with it?"" he said. ""They took it out and they spread it around Tehran in an effort to hide the evidence.""
He said Iranian officials still had a lot of work to do because there were some 15 shipping containers full of nuclear-related equipment and materials stored at the second site.
""This site contained as much as 300 tonnes - 300 tonnes - of nuclear-related equipment and materiel,"" he said.
Under the nuclear deal struck by Iran and six major powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S. and other economic sanctions.
The International Atomic Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly said Tehran was abiding by its commitments to the deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), including in a document reviewed by Reuters on Aug. 30.
France, Britain, Germany, China and Russia have stayed in the pact, vowing to save it despite the restoration of U.S. sanctions and this week discussing a barter mechanism they hope may allow Iran to circumvent the U.S. measures.
Netanyahu criticized Europe for doing so in unusually harsh language that evoked European nations' initial failure to confront Nazi Germany in the 1930s.
""While the United States is confronting Iran with new sanctions, Europe and others are appeasing Iran by trying to help it bypass those new sanctions,"" Netanyahu said.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States is aware of the facility Netanyahu announced and described it as a ""warehouse"" used to store ""records and archives"" from Iran’s nuclear program.
A second U.S. intelligence official called Netanyahu’s comments ""somewhat misleading. First, we have known about this facility for some time, and it’s full of file cabinets and paper, not aluminum tubes for centrifuges, and second, so far as anyone knows, there is nothing in it that would allow Iran to break out of the JCPOA any faster than it otherwise could.""
The Israeli leader also lambasted Iran's ballistic missile activity, identifying three locations near Beirut airport where he said Lebanon's Hezbollah was converting missiles.
""In Lebanon, Iran is directing Hezbollah to build secret sites to convert inaccurate projectiles into precision-guided missiles, missiles that can target deep inside Israel within an accuracy of 10 meters (yards),"" he said.
The IAEA and Hezbollah were not immediately available for comment.

The Israeli military released a video clip and photos of what it said were Hezbollah Shi'ite militia rocket building sites in Lebanon, shortly after Netanyahu's address.

""Mexican society has historically suffered from the impossibility of demanding accountability from the head of the executive branch,"" said the bill.
""The essential foundation of being able to repeal the (presidential) mandate is not only that citizens have greater elements of participation in government, but also the inescapable recognition that sovereignty stems from the will of the people,"" it added.
Mexico's constitution does not mention recall referendums.
Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Dec. 1, said during the campaign that he would hold a referendum on his performance at the middle of the six-year term and would cut it short if he loses the consultation.
Constitutional reforms in Mexico require the support of two thirds of the lawmakers present at the time of the vote. Lopez Obrador's MORENA party and his allies do not have that majority in any of the chambers of Congress.

The constitutional reform would also need to receive the support of more than half of the 32 local legislatures, represented by Mexico's 31 states and one federal district.

But researchers cautioned that a narrow victory for those hoping to reverse the decision taken two years ago would be heavily contingent on getting those who did not vote last time to turn out. 
The figures are calculated by taking the average of the six most recent surveys by major pollsters between Aug. 21 and Sept. 10. 
""True, Remain enjoys a lead in the polls. But that lead remains a narrow one, and there is little sign of it growing,"" said Senior Research Fellow at The National Centre for Social Research (NatCen) John Curtice. 
""It rests quite heavily on the preferences of those who did not vote two years ago, and who by two to one now say they would back Remain. Getting them to turn out to vote in any second ballot might yet prove a considerable challenge."" 
London and Brussels are racing to agree a Brexit deal but Prime Minister Theresa May's proposals have been criticized by both the European Union and Euroskeptics within her party. She has ruled out having a second referendum. 
But the main opposition Labour Party is open to a second public vote with the option of staying in the bloc, its Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said earlier this week. 

Campaigners on both sides of the argument have been stepping up their efforts in recent weeks as some Brexiteers argue for a cleaner break from the EU and Remainers say ending membership as currently planned would do economic damage to Britain.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian legislators, in a symbolic move, on Thursday voted unanimously to strip Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi of her honorary citizenship in response to crimes committed against the Rohingya minority.
The move by the House of Commons lower chamber has no immediate effect because honorary citizenship is conferred by a joint resolution of both the House and the upper Senate chamber and officials say it must be removed the same way. Suu Kyi received hers in 2007.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters on Wednesday that he was open to looking at stripping Suu Kyi of the honor but said doing so would not end the crisis in Myanmar, where more than 700,000 Rohingya have fled a government crackdown.
The motion on removing the honorary citizenship was proposed by Gabriel Ste Marie, a member of the opposition Bloc Quebecois party, who told reporters after the vote that ""I think it's a great symbol"".
The House of Commons last week unanimously voted to call the killings of Rohingya a genocide, a move that Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said at the time was significant.
""Our government supported this motion in response to her (Suu Kyi's) continued failure to speak out against the genocide of the Rohingya, a crime being committed by the military with which she shares power,"" said Freeland spokesman Adam Austen.
Legislator Andrew Leslie, who serves as Freeland's parliamentary secretary, told reporters ""that the machinery of government will chew over the details of what specifically is required to implement"" the motion.
The Myanmar government was not immediately available for comment. 
Freeland is among many western politicians who condemned the decision by a Myanmar judge earlier this month to find two Reuters journalists guilty of breaching a law on state secrets.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who had been probing the killing by the security forces of Rohingya villagers, were jailed for seven years. They had pleaded not guilty.

A U.S. government investigation last month found Myanmar's military waged a ""well-planned and coordinated"" campaign of mass killings, gang rapes and other atrocities against the Rohingya.

SANTIAGO/LA PAZ (Reuters) - A World Court ruling next week on Bolivia's claim that Chile has ducked a legal obligation to discuss access to the sea could force the Andean neighbors to the negotiating table over a land spat lingering since the 19th century. 
The International Court of Justice in The Hague, which settles legal disputes between United Nations member states, is due to announce on Monday its findings in the row, which came to a head after landlocked Bolivia filed a lawsuit in 2013 seeking to force Chile to negotiate access to the Pacific Ocean.
If the ICJ rules in favor of Bolivia, it can order Chile into a negotiation of ""good faith"" with its neighbor. But the question of ""good faith"" is a thorny one, said Paul Reichler, a Washington-based attorney who specializes in representing states before the ICJ for Foley Hoag law firm.
""For Chile to engage in good faith negotiations, does that mean it has to be willing to cede as least some of its sovereign territory? Most states would not give any territory.""
A more realistic outcome of ""good faith"" negotiations could be for Chile to offer other ways to help facilitate Bolivia's trade, like free access to more Chilean ports, or highways or railways built for Bolivia on Chilean land, Reichler said.
While the ICJ's rulings are binding for U.N. members, it has no power to enforce them. 
Reichler said the case was the first of its kind before the ICJ - involving a claim by one state that there was a breach of an obligation by another to negotiate a cession of territory - and it is unlikely to spur similar legal battles. 
""It would be next to impossible to find a parallel situation,"" he said. 
'TWO STUBBORN NEIGHBORS' 
Bolivia lost its access to the sea after it was defeated in a war with Chile in the 1880s, which annexed its coastline. Bolivia, one of the poorest nations in Latin America, claims the lack of sea access has stinted its economic growth.
Before the ICJ, Bolivia argued that Chile had not kept diplomatic promises and obligations made under international law to negotiate sea access, namely a land corridor and port under its control.
Chile said any discussions would be a matter of diplomacy and it was not legally obligated to further negotiate, arguing that the issue was settled by a 1904 peace treaty.
It also points out that Bolivia already has duty free access to the Chilean port of Arica. However, Bolivia wants its own sovereign port. 
The dispute has long been a thorn in diplomatic relations between the two countries, which have not hosted ambassadors for each other for decades.
""This is the story of two stubborn neighbors that make the whole neighborhood ugly because they cannot talk to each other,"" said Patricio Navia, a political science professor at New York University and Diego Portales University in Chile.
If Chile is forced by the court to open a dialogue with Bolivia, it would be a political embarrassment for Chilean President Sebastian Pinera, Navia said. 
Bolivian President Evo Morales, who will make a bid in 2019 for a controversial fourth term, has used the dispute to rally political support. Bolivia maintains a navy and celebrates an annual ""day of the sea"" commemoration to reiterate its perceived right to ocean access. 

""I think Morales prefers to use this as a campaign tool because every time he finds himself in problems, he can point to Chile's denial of claims for sovereign access as the reason for Bolivia's underdevelopment,"" Navia said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. government probe into Myanmar's campaign against the Rohingya Muslim minority was not aimed at determining whether genocide or crimes against humanity had been committed, but those responsible could still be held accountable for those crimes, a top State Department official said on Thursday. 
The U.S. State Department report released on Monday said Myanmar's military waged a ""well-planned and coordinated"" campaign of mass killings, gang rapes and other atrocities against the Rohingya.
But it stopped short of describing the crackdown as genocide or crimes against humanity, an issue that other U.S. officials said was the subject of fierce internal debate that delayed the report's rollout for nearly a month.
""There weren’t legal judgments expressed in it because that wasn’t the point of the report,"" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan told a news conference in New York when asked why the report had not used the words ""genocide"" or ""crimes against humanity.""
He added: ""We are working toward holding those accountable, including judgments like the one you have offered - characterizing it as a crime against humanity or genocide.""
Sullivan spoke on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, shortly before Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Kyaw Tint Swe, Myanmar's minister for the Office of the State Counselor and its representative to the U.N. session.Pompeo did not respond to a reporter's question about whether there had been genocide in Myanmar.
U.S. officials told Reuters earlier this week that the State Department report could be used to justify further U.S. sanctions or other punitive measures against Myanmar authorities.
The report, which was first reported by Reuters, resulted from more than a thousand interviews of Rohingya men and women in refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh, where almost 700,000 Rohingya have fled after a military campaign last year in Myanmar's Rakhine State.
Survivors described in harrowing detail what they had witnessed, including soldiers killing infants and small children, the shooting of unarmed men, and victims buried alive or thrown into pits of mass graves. They told of widespread sexual assault by Myanmar’s military of Rohingya women, often carried out in public.
The Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay declined to comment when reached on Tuesday and said he was unable to answer questions by telephone. Calls to military spokesman Major General Tun Tun Nyi were unanswered.
Human rights groups and Rohingya activists have put the death toll in the thousands from the crackdown, which followed attacks by Rohingya insurgents on security forces in Rakhine State in August 2017.
The results of the U.S. investigation were released in low-key fashion - posted on the State Department's website - nearly a month after U.N. investigators issued their own report accusing Myanmar’s military of acting with ""genocidal intent"" and calling for the country’s commander-in-chief and five generals to be prosecuted under international law.
The military in Myanmar, previously known as Burma, where Buddhism is the main religion, has denied accusations of ethnic cleansing and says its actions were part of a fight against terrorism.
Senior State Department officials said the aim of the report was to guide U.S. policy aimed at holding the perpetrators accountable. The report proposed no new steps.

One official said it would be up to Pompeo whether to make such a ""legal"" designation in the future and did not rule out the possibility.

Citing sources close to Bolsonaro, the paper said he caught a bacterial infection after a catheter was removed during his recovery from a near-fatal stabbing in the abdomen three weeks ago.
Bolsonaro has held the lead for the Oct. 7 election despite being unable to campaign. But polls show leftist Workers Party candidate Fernando Haddad has surged to just six points behind Bolsonaro and would win an expected second-round run-off.
Bolsonaro's campaign did not return calls.
Spokespeople for Sao Paulo's Albert Einstein hospital did not immediately reply to requests for comment. The hospital's daily bulletin on Bolsonaro's condition issued in the afternoon said he was recovering well and had no fever or pain. 

Bolsonaro, 63, was stabbed by an assailant on Sept. 6 as he was carried aloft by supporters in a street rally.

""This is the moment to change the course of the negotiations and do justice to the ambitions and potential of Brexit,"" Johnson wrote in Friday's Daily Telegraph, adding a six-point alternative plan for Brexit.
""There has been a collective failure of government, and a collapse of will by the British establishment, to deliver on the mandate of the people,"" he wrote.
Just six months before the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29, 2019, little is clear: PM May has yet to clinch a Brexit divorce deal with the EU and rebels in her party have threatened to vote down any deal she makes.
Johnson, one the most prominent campaigners for Brexit in the 2016 referendum, resigned in July as foreign secretary over May's Brexit proposals which he cast in his 4,600-word Daily Telegraph article as ""enforced vassalage"". 

May has repeatedly said her Brexit proposals are the only viable ones.

Three armed forces sources told Reuters that manufacturers from the United States, France and Israel were in the running to provide the system, which could cost more than $300 million.
President Ivan Duque has pledged to devote most government investment to education, healthcare and food and housing help for the poorest Colombians, but said this week that defense systems must meet the country's needs.
""The country, without getting into any kind of arms race, must have the resources that its national security requires. Colombia has historically made acquisitions of equipment and we want to make them within the needs of the country, without any bellicose motivations,"" Duque told journalists during a trip to New York.
The purchase would be part of a renewal program for Air Force equipment and arms. Despite a 2016 peace agreement with the longtime FARC rebels, Colombia's military remains at war with the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels, drug-trafficking crime gangs and dissident FARC who refused to demobilize under the peace deal.
In 2005 Colombia bought 25 Super Tucano A-29B planes from Brazil's Embraer for $234.5 million, its largest-ever military purchase. At the beginning of 2015 the Andean country added 32 Canadian-made armored vehicles to a unit close to the border with Venezuela, at a cost of $84 million.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Thursday he could relinquish his plans for more ambitious spending in order to secure passage of his government's 2019 budget in parliament, an important test for his four-month-old minority government.
The Socialist leader told Reuters he could be forced to work with the former, tighter deficit targets set by the previous conservative government and thereby avoid a budgetary stalemate that could lead to a snap election.
Sanchez's government, which controls only 84 seats in the 350-seat parliament, cannot pass the full budget without the parties which brought him to power in June, when they backed a no-confidence motion against his predecessor Mariano Rajoy.
Sanchez secured an agreement with the European Union to raise the public deficit target to 1.8 percent of gross domestic product, compared with a previous target of 1.3 percent, freeing up money he planned to use on education and social spending in the euro zone's fourth largest economy. 
""If we are obliged to present a draft with the former commitments we will do it,"" Sanchez said in a Newsmaker event moderated by Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen Adler.
Asked if the fight over the budget would lead to a new election, Sanchez said ""no."" But he warned that the two conservative parties that want the tighter budget ""will need to explain to the Spaniards why they vote against having much more resources for our education, our public health, and our pension system."" 
A July vote against his budget plans unleashed the first crisis for his young government, brought to power in June with the tenuous backing of seven parties.
Sanchez is sticking to his position of not bringing forward the next national election due mid-2020. 
""Of course politics is always a game of priorities. If you prioritize conflict instead of cooperation ... we will go for elections,"" Sanchez said. 
""But if you say let's put first cooperation in order to solve social policies or others I think that we can last until the year 2020. And this is my idea, this is my goal.""
PESSIMISTIC ABOUT VENEZUELA
Sanchez, in New York for his first United Nations General Assembly meetings as head of Spain's government, said he has discussed helping South American countries deal with a wave of refugees from Venezuela fleeing economic collapse and food shortages.
His has opposed the socialist government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, citing its treatment of opposition parties and political prisoners, and said he did not see a political solution to the crisis.
""I would say I am pessimistic,"" Sanchez said. ""I see that the Maduro regime does not open any window to dialogue with the opposition.""
Asked if Venezuela's crisis could be resolved without a change in government, Sanchez said: ""I would say, in a very polite manner, I think it's very difficult.""
He said he supports the mediation work in Venezuela of his fellow Socialist and former Spanish prime minister, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who has come under criticism from the opposition for not being tougher on Maduro.
Sanchez, a strong backer of the European Union, said he was concerned about what he called ""turbulence"" in transatlantic ties with the United States under U.S. President Donald Trump, who has challenged EU leaders on trade tariffs, climate change, multilateralism and defense spending. 

""I think that he's committing a mistake with regard to the European Union,"" Sanchez said. ""I do believe that a stronger Europe also works positively in the interests of the U.S. administration and the U.S. society.""

Fresh from a meeting with U.S. president Donald Trump at the United Nations, May cruised through rush-hour New York traffic in a police-escorted motorcade, but a vehicle carrying eight senior aides was forced to stop with gearbox failure.
May's Royal Air Force jet waited on the tarmac at John F Kennedy airport for nearly an hour while the officials waited for a replacement vehicle and struck a deal with a local police patrol car for an escort to the runway.
After a lengthy wait, the prime minister warned the delayed delegates they had six minutes to make it to the plane or they would be left behind, two of the officials said.
But with the help of three New York Police Department Officers they made it in time and May honored the deal by posing with the policemen on the steps to her plane.
The officers got staff to take the picture on a cell phone, while May's official photographer also captured the event. Staff gave her and the late arrivals a round of applause as they re-entered the plane.
""New York’s finest rescued the PM’s team from the side of the freeway and got us to the runway for the flight home,"" a source said. 

""Just another way to deepen the special relationship, and we’re very grateful for their help.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A United Nations agency that supports Palestinian refugees received contributions of $118 million on Thursday, narrowing a budget gap for this year to $68 million as it aims to fill a shortfall left by a cut in U.S. funding.
Pierre Krahenbuhl, Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), said the pledges were made at a meeting on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations in New York. 
He said the largest funding pledges on Thursday were made by Germany, the European Union, Kuwait, Ireland and Norway.
""Five million Palestinian refugees were following these events very, very closely indeed. It was year of tremendous existential concerns, of great anxiety ... I think it is a very big step that has been achieved today,"" Krahenbuhl said. 
The United States last month announced a halt in its aid to UNRWA, calling it an ""irredeemably flawed operation,"" a decision that further heightened tensions between the Palestinian leadership and the Trump administration.
UNRWA provides services to about 5 million Palestinian refugees across Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank and Gaza. Most are descendants of some 700,000 Palestinians who were driven out of their homes or fled fighting in the 1948 war that led to Israel's creation.
The growing refugee count was cited by Washington, UNRWA's biggest donor, in its decision to withhold funding.
""We're sending a message that the world does still care about the plight of Palestinian refugees,"" Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told reporters. 

""The challenge is to sustain this effort and part of what we discussed today is a way in which we could have a long term financial planning so not every year in August, Palestinian kids will be wondering if they have a school to go to,"" he said.

""In Lebanon, Iran is directing Hezbollah to build secret sites to convert inaccurate projectiles into precision-guided missiles, missiles that can target deep inside Israel within an accuracy of 10 meters (yards),"" he said.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the Israeli assertions in Netanyahu's speech and in the five photographs and the 76-second clip released by the Israel Defence Forces.
The clip refers to a ""Missile Accuracy Project (MAP)"" which Israel said Hezbollah had tried to transfer ""to the heart of the city of Beirut."" 
The Israeli military said the deployment of the facilities close to Beirut international airport were ""knowingly jeopardizing the Lebanese civilian population.""

In Beirut, Hezbollah's media officer Muhammad Afif declined to comment on the report.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin on Thursday cast doubt on photographs that appeared to show a suspect in the Skripal poisoning case was a Russian intelligence officer, saying that ""many people look alike.""
British officials have released surveillance footage of two men they said flew from Russia to Britain using fake passports and then used a nerve agent hidden in a vial of perfume that poisoned Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter.
The Bellingcat investigative website this week published a photograph of someone who looked like one of the men, and whom it identified as Russian military intelligence colonel Anatoliy Chepiga -- challenging the Kremlin account that the two men were civilians in Britain on sightseeing visit.
Asked about the Bellingcat report on a regular conference call with reporters on Thursday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""Many people look alike, but I cannot tell you who this citizen who was pointed out in this investigation is.""
Russian President Vladimir Putin previously said the two men shown in British surveillance footage near Skripal's home in the English city of Salisbury were civilians and there was nothing criminal about their activity.
Asked on Thursday to comment on Putin's words in the light of the new information, Peskov said: ""The president said that these people were civilians. Thus, he voiced the information that he had received ... You and I know nothing about these people's past, it is outside our (job) function.""
He said Russian officials would look into the information brought to light by the Bellingcat report. 
The man named by Bellingcat, Anatoly Chepiga, has been designated a Hero of the Russian Federation, one of Russia's highest honours, according to the website of the military academy he attended and photographs of a memorial on which his name is inscribed.
""We will check the lists of honourees,"" Peskov said.
Sergei Skripal, a Russian ex-spy who leaked secrets to Western intelligence, was found slumped on a public bench in Salisbury on March 4, alongside his daughter, Yulia. They were in a coma for weeks.
British officials said they had been poisoned with the Russian-developed ""Novichok"" nerve agent. They have been discharged from hospital but a local woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after accidental exposure to the agent, British officials said.
The Skripal poisoning has deepened Russia's international isolation. Britain accused it of using a military-grade chemical weapon on its soil and Washington, rallying to London's support, has warned it will impose new sanctions on Russia.
Moscow has denied any involvement in the Skripal poisoning, saying Western states are gripped by ""Russophobia"" and that British authorities have failed to produce any evidence.
FRANK EXCHANGE
British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt said on Thursday he had spoken about the poisoning to his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Hunt told Sky News he had a frank exchange of views with Lavrov, and said Russia may be privately regretting its actions. ""They paid a very high diplomatic price,"" he said.
In an interview broadcast on Russian state television earlier this month, two Russian men said they were Ruslan Boshirov and Alexander Petrov - the aliases Britain said were used by the suspects in the Skripal poisoning.
They denied any connection to the poisoning, saying they were friends who worked in the health supplements business and went to Salisbury to see its gothic cathedral.
The report by Bellingcat published this week cited what it said was an official Russian passport dossier for Chepiga, which included his photograph. It bore a close resemblance to the man in the British surveillance footage using the name Ruslan Boshirov.
According to the Bellingcat report, Chepiga was born in 1979 in a village in the far east of Russia, and studied at the elite Far-Eastern Military Command Academy. 
It said he served in a special forces brigade under the command of Russian military intelligence, and went on several missions to the Russian region of Chechnya, where Moscow was fighting an Islamist insurgency.
It said he received the Hero of Russia award in 2014, the year Russian military intelligence took part in clandestine operations on Ukrainian territory. The citation on his old academy's website did not give any details of why he was given the award.

Two European security sources familiar with the Skripal investigation said the details published by Bellingcat were accurate.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian celebrities who joined millions of women in a campaign against far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro have been ""brainwashed,"" with his low female support explained by women taking their time to shop around, his running mate told Reuters. 
Using a retail analogy that will likely rile many female voters, retired General Hamilton Mourão said that women take longer than men to decide who to vote for, and that is why polls show there are fewer of them supporting the presidential contender just ten days before the Oct. 7 election. 
""You know, a man goes into a shop and buys, and that's it. A woman takes time to buy. It's the same logic,"" he said. 
Mourão was also dismissive of a growing online movement that has attracted some of Brazil's top female stars to speak out against Bolsonaro, the polarizing frontrunner whose career has been marked by sexist, racist and anti-gay comments that critics say make him unfit for the presidency.
""What we can see, clearly, is that our artists, and the intellectual class, have been brainwashed and seem to have just one view of the world,"" Mourão said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. ""It seems they have stopped thinking.""
A social media campaign against Bolsonaro called #EleNao, or #NotHim, has exploded in recent weeks, garnering support from pop singers Anitta and Daniela Mercury. A ""Women United Against Bolsonaro"" Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group reached 3.5 million members, but has gone private after being hacked. 
Millions of women across Brazil are expected to take to the streets on Saturday and march against Bolsonaro, who was indicted for inciting violence after shouting ""I won't rape you because you don't deserve it"" at a leftist lawmaker on the floor of the lower house of Congress in 2014.
He has said that the gender pay gap is justified and has pledged to veto any attempts to legalize abortion. Last year, he said having a daughter, his fifth child after four boys, was ""a moment of weakness.""
Bolsonaro's conservative social views and vows to loosen gun laws and end years of graft have resonated among evangelicals and voters worn down by recession and rising violence.
But he has the highest rejection rate by women among the 13 candidates in the race - 54 percent, according to a survey by polling firm Ibope published this week.
Bolsonaro's low support among women could cost him the election if, as expected, no candidate wins a majority in the first round, prompting an Oct. 28 run-off.

Surveys suggest Bolsonaro could lose the run-off to leftist Workers Party candidate Fernando Haddad, thanks mainly to the votes of women, Ibope said.

""Of course, I also rule this out categorically,"" Merkel said during a panel discussion after a senior CDU member in the eastern state of Saxony suggested that a coalition with the AfD should not be excluded in next year's regional elections.
Merkel's decision to welcome more than a million migrants in 2015 caused a popular backlash and propelled the AfD into the national parliament following last year's federal election.
In regional elections next year in the eastern states of Saxony, Brandenburg and Thuringia, the AfD is expected to make strong gains at the cost of Merkel's conservatives and her center-left coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD).
The rise of the AfD could make it harder to form coalition governments in regional elections in Bavaria and Hesse next month.
Merkel said the influx of asylum seekers in 2015 had ""somewhat split"" the country.

She insisted her center-right CDU/CSU alliance had to draw a line when it came to the AfD and politicians must make clear that hate against foreigners could not be tolerated.

422,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 02:39PM ET</span>","Palestinian president urges Trump to rescind Jerusalem, aid decisions","By Yara Bayoumy and Arshad Mohammed
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Thursday called on the United States to reverse its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and cuts in aid to the Palestinians, saying these had undermined the two-state solution to the conflict.
""With all of these decisions, this administration has reneged on all previous U.S. commitments, and has undermined the two-state solution,"" Abbas said in his address to the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations.
""I renew my call to President Trump to rescind his decisions and decrees regarding Jerusalem, refugees and settlements.""
The last Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014 and there are doubts that U.S. President Donald Trump can secure what he has called the ""ultimate deal"" since he recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December and moved the U.S. Embassy there in May.
The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Israel captured those territories in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally. Israel regards all of the city as its eternal and indivisible capital.
Trump has equivocated on whether he supports the idea of a two-state solution, with one for the Israelis and one for the Palestinians, a plank of U.S. policy for decades.
On Wednesday, in his administration's clearest support for the idea, he said ""I like a two-state solution. That's what I think works best,"" but later in the day backed off, saying he would also support a one-state solution if both sides wanted it.
Abbas said the United States could no longer be the sole mediator.
""The U.S. acts as a mediator; however now we view the U.S. with new eyes. The U.S. cannot be a mediator single-handedly,"" Abbas said.
Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman criticized Abbas' speech, saying: ""Instead of responding to the outstretched hand of Israel and the United States, the only thing that interests (him) is to settle scores and drive the region toward confrontation"".
Palestinians are boycotting Washington's peace efforts after Trump broke with long-standing U.S. policy by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving the American Embassy to the contested city.
Earlier on Thursday Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi called for a resumption of Israel-Palestinian peace talks when he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, Sisi's office said.
HAMAS DISMISSES TRUMP REMARKS
Netanyahu, who said he was not surprised by Trump's initial comments on the two-state solution, devoted the majority of his U.N. address to Iran.
Netanyahu said the Iran nuclear deal, which he deeply opposes, had the unintended consequence of bringing Israel and many Arab states closer over their shared mistrust of Iran.
“By empowering Iran, it brought Israel and many Arab states closer together than ever before ... in an intimacy and friendship that I have not seen in my lifetime, and would have been unimaginable a few years ago. ... Israel deeply values these new friendships, and I hope the day will soon arrive when Israel will be able to expand peace, a formal peace, beyond Egypt and Jordan, to other Arab neighbors, including the Palestinians.”
Hani al-Masri, a political analyst in Ramallah, said: ""There was nothing new in Abbas's speech. He repeated his known positions, and he just kept threatening, without making decisions.""
Hamas on Thursday dismissed Trump's remarks on a two-state solution. Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesman, said the current White House administration had adopted the ""rightist vision"" of Israel's government.

Speaking in Gaza, Qassem said that Trump's decisions to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to move the U.S. Embassy to the city ""shows that he underestimates the Palestinian stance, and that is caused by the weakness of the official Palestinian stance represented by President Abbas.""

423,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 02:39PM ET</span>",Italy coalition targets economy minister as budget deadline looms,"By Giuseppe Fonte and Angelo Amante
ROME (Reuters) - A clash between Italy's ruling parties and their technocrat economy minister intensified on Thursday hours before the government was to unveil its first budget targets, sparking a sell off of state bonds on fears the minister could quit.
Some coalition voices publicly told Economy Minister Giovanni Tria he should resign if he couldn't back their spending plans as Tria insisted the 2019 fiscal deficit should not exceed 2 percent of national output. 
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's office denied a newspaper report that a cabinet meeting to agree the deficit figure would be pushed back a day or two, and the meeting was finally set for 8 p.m. (1800 GMT), two hours later than originally planned.
At 8:20 p.m. the meeting had still not begun, after Tria, Conte and the leaders of the ruling parties had met in the afternoon and failed to break a deadlock over the budget goal. 
Tria's office denied on Thursday that he would quit, and Italian bonds, which had sold off on a newspaper report that the cabinet meeting may be delayed by days and that Tria could resign, recovered some of their early losses.
The ruling coalition made up of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League are pushing Tria, an academic not affiliated to either party, to ramp up the fiscal deficit to finance their promises of tax cuts and higher welfare spending.
""A battle is underway between us and Tria,"" said a 5-Star source who asked not to be named. ""Tria is holding to the 1.6 pct (of gross domestic product) deficit target and has threatened to resign. We have told him that he can go.""
""The ruling parties are in agreement,"" the source added.
The chief whip for the League said Tria should leave if he could not accede to the ruling parties' desired deficit target.
""If Tria agrees with us, then OK, but if not we'll find another minister,"" Riccardo Molinari told Reuters. He said a deficit of between 2.4 percent and 2.6 percent of GDP had been proposed and ""would not be a tragedy."" 
The coalition parties say the priority must be financing policies including a basic income for the poor and a reduction in the minimum retirement age, rather than meeting deficit goals previously agreed with Brussels.
As ministers began arriving at the prime minister's office for the cabinet meeting, League leader Matteo Salvini and 5-Star chief Luigi Di Maio were still insisting on a 2019 deficit of 2.4 percent of GDP, a government source said.
""HISTORIC CROSSROADS""
""We are at an historic crossroads and we can't backtrack by a centimetre,"" Di Maio said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), calling on the government to remain united behind what he has dubbed the ""People's Budget.""
He said Italy's bond yields rose on fears of political instability, not concern over the deficit, and the coalition would deliver ""the structural reforms and investments needed to relaunch growth.""
Financial markets have been nervous since the government took office in June due to fears its spending plans will boost Italy's debt, which is already the highest in the euro zone after Greece's as a proportion of GDP - around 131 percent.
Italy's government bonds had rallied this week on the expectation Tria could water down the coalition's more radical proposals and keep a lid on public finances.
At its meeting, the cabinet is due to sign off on targets for economic growth, the deficit and public debt for 2018-2021, with most attention focused on the 2019 deficit goal.
Tria was now willing to accept a ratio of around 1.9 percent, government sources have said.
That would compare with a current target of 1.6 percent for this year, and would be sharply up from a 0.8 percent goal penciled in for 2019 by the previous center-left administration.
Even the coalition's calls for a deficit of up to 2.6 percent would be well inside the 3 percent ceiling prescribed by EU rules, but Italy had promised Brussels it would cut the deficit decisively to rein in its high debt.
The targets form the framework for the 2019 budget, which must be approved by the cabinet by Oct. 20.
Tria said on Wednesday the budget would include the parties' flagship policies, including the basic income for the poor and a lower retirement age, though it remains unclear how wide-ranging such measures will initially be and how they will be financed.

Duque, who has been visiting New York for the United Nations General Assembly, said in his inaugural address last month he would take 30 days to evaluate the talks, which began in 2017 under his predecessor. The deadline has passed without a definitive decision from the right-wing Colombian leader on whether they will continue.
He has urged the 2,000-strong National Liberation Army (ELN) to free all hostages as a condition for resuming dialogue. The group has so far released nine, all members of the security forces or military contractors. A remaining 10 hostages are civilians.
Venezuela, Cuba, Chile, Brazil and Norway have served as so-called guarantors at negotiations with the ELN, which were being held in Cuba until just before Duque took office.
Guarantors are meant to be neutral facilitators of the talks, providing negotiating facilities and other help. 
But Colombia's government and armed forces have long accused Venezuela of allowing rebel groups to cross into its territory freely and hide out there.
""A country that has supported the ELN in its territory, protecting it, which has allowed criminal acts against the Colombian people to be forged in its territory is far from being a guarantor,"" Duque told journalists before his return flight to Bogota.
""I can't see as a guarantor a country that has been a protector of armed groups in its territory.""
Venezuela, which is reeling from a crushing economic and social crisis as thousands flee in search of scarce food and medicine, previously served as a guarantor in talks between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). 
Those talks ended in a 2016 peace deal under which the FARC, once much larger than the ELN, demobilized and formed a political party.

Venezuela's leftist government and an ELN representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Duque's remarks.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian President Ivan Duque's campaign promise to eschew traditional deal-making with the legislature may make it hard for him to pass business-friendly tax proposals, modifications to a peace deal with Marxist rebels and other measures that are unpopular with some centrist and leftist legislators.
Duque took office early last month with a thin legislative majority, and will struggle even before proposed laws reach the floor. His government lacks majorities in several of the committees where lawmakers initially discuss bills. 
Yet he has pledged to stop special interest groups from trading support for politicians for government favors or funding. Colombians call the practice ""marmalade"" because money and influence are spread around.
Opposition politicians have scoffed at the promise, saying Duque will be obliged to make deals to get his laws through.
Graft has become a major issue in Colombia following a raft of scandals involving everything from vote-buying to embezzlement from a school lunch program. 
Nearly 12 million voters backed anti-corruption measures in a referendum last month, and at least 10 current or retired lawmakers were investigated or tried in a scandal involving kickbacks by Brazilian construction company Odebrecht.
But Duque's promises to avoid backroom dealings could limit his ability to pass measures needed to salvage the country's investment grade credit rating and keep his promise to tighten restrictions on former FARC rebels. 
His coalition has a slender Senate majority of 54 out of 106 seats. In the lower house his backers hold just 83 of 170 seats, which is less than half.
""He has a weak majority and the challenge is big because Duque is trying to do politics without handing out jobs or contracts to lawmakers,"" political analyst Marcela Prieto said. ""Changing that political culture will not be easy. It will cost him a lot to pass his legislative proposals.""
Duque's weak backing has analysts and ratings agencies worried that he will have trouble passing an expansion of the tax base and cuts to duties for companies. Colombia has an investment grade rating and a stable outlook from Fitch and S&P.
""Political fragmentation or confrontation may complicate the task of passing those reforms,"" Samar Maziad, vice-president of Moody's said. ""That's part of the negative outlook we have on the rating."" 
The government has forecast that Colombia's $300 billion economy will grow 2.7 percent this year. It has a 3.1 percent deficit target for 2018, and a quarter of local Treasury bonds are held by foreign investors.
Beyond his Democratic Center party, Duque has the Conservatives, the U Party and four others in his stable. Some members of U Party, which led a governing coalition under ex-President Juan Manuel Santos, have said they will not back the administration.
Centrist parties likes the Liberals and Radical Change have declined to join the coalition, making their votes wild cards.
Duque has also pledged to push through a justice system modernization and modify the 2016 peace deal that allowed FARC rebels to demobilize and form a political party. Ex-guerrillas accused of war crimes should be tried before they take up political posts, Duque has said, but changing the deal would require two-thirds majorities.
Lawmakers from independent parties could tilt the balance in Duque's favor. They may be more likely to back the tax and justice system reforms and anti-corruption measures that proved popular in the recent referendum, including a three-term limit for lawmakers.
""When we're not supporting him, he'll have problems,"" said Senator German Varon of the Radical Change party.
Opposition Senator Jorge Robledo, from the left-wing Democratic Pole, says independents may back the government if offers of patronage are on the table.

""With clientelism they'll arrange majorities,"" Robledo said. ""That isn't to say that the president won't have hurdles, problems, that could cause him a crisis.""

Zenon al-Makari, 45, died while being rushed to hospital after suffering severe stomach pains. He had served as a confessional priest for two defrocked monks charged with the murder of the Bishop Epiphanius on July 29, fellow monks said.
A Church spokesman said Zenon had suffered a ""sudden health crisis"" and prosecutors were investigating the cause of death.
Zenon was one of six monks that Coptic Church authorities had relocated away from the Abu Makar (Saint Macarius) Monastery some 110 km (70 miles) northwest of Cairo, a month after the murder there, on Aug. 25.
Monks at the al-Muhharaq Monastery in Assiut, where Zenon was transferred, said he had been distressed and declined to mix with other monks.
He was on a list of witnesses scheduled to testify in the trial of the two former monks, which opened last week, according to a lawyer involved in the trial and a security source in Beheira province, where the hearing is taking place. 
The murder of Bishop Epiphanius had rocked the Church in a country where Christians make up an estimated 10 percent of the 96 million population.
Pope Tawadros immediately ordered a freeze on accepting new monks, a ban on monks leaving monasteries without permission, and a ban on clergy using social media.
Judicial sources said one of the monks accused of the killing, Wael Saad, known by his monastic name Isaiah al-Makari, had confessed during questioning to the murder. 
Egyptian media reported this week that Saad, at his first hearing, had denied killing Epiphanius and said he had confessed under pressure.
In a statement last month, the prosecution said Saad had long had differences with his superiors, who had on one occasion investigated him for breaking monastery traditions.
The second monk accused of involvement in the murder, Ramon Rasmi Mansour, threw himself from the monastery roof this month. He has been treated in a Cairo hospital where he has also been questioned, judicial sources told Reuters.

Without naming Trump or his nationalist, protectionist approach, Merkel told fellow conservatives at an event of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Berlin that the European Union and Germany were facing a watershed moment.
Trump has threatened to pull the United States out of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), potentially undermining one of the foundations of the modern global economy, which Washington was instrumental in creating.
The tycoon-turned-president has also questioned the value of the NATO alliance, the centerpiece of transatlantic security cooperation for almost seven decades.
""Perhaps the most threatening development for me is that multilateralism has come under such pressure,"" Merkel said. ""Europe is facing attacks from the outside and from the inside.""
Merkel, who grew up in old Communist East Germany, called the end of the Cold War illusory, saying she never would have expected the world would face a similar ideological clash between different schools of thought again.
""I did not expect to have conflicts of different systems again, as we have today with China, but also in dealing with data and certainly also with the United States of America,"" Merkel said.
IN DANGER
The changing political landscape and shifting international order, she said, make it necessary again to emphasize supposedly self-evident achievements such as tolerance and the art of striving for political compromises.
""It's a time of decisions where supposedly obvious things call for a standpoint,"" said Merkel, adding that win-win outcomes could hardly be achieved if some were approaching the resolution of disputes with a winner-take-all attitude.
""Where compromises are scorned, democracy is in danger,"" Merkel said, against a backdrop of rising tensions within both her governing coalition and European Union member states.
It was the ""supreme discipline of democracy"", she said, to find a balance between different interests.
Pointing to the increased use of social media platforms by some politicians, Merkel warned of producing ""spirals of outrage"". The exchange of differing views was vital for democracy, as was the need to avoid simplification.
Her warning followed a report by Germany's leading economic institutes who said on Thursday that any escalation of trade friction involving the United States could cause a major recession in Germany and Europe.

Trump's speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday was a thunderous recitation of his ""America First"" policies. He has disrupted the world order by withdrawing the United States from the Iran nuclear deal and Paris climate accord, and threatened to punish NATO nations for not paying more for their common defense.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. Human Rights Council voted on Thursday to set up a body to prepare evidence of human rights abuses in Myanmar, including possible genocide, for any future prosecution.
The 47-member Council voted by 35 votes to three, with seven abstentions, in favor of a resolution brought by the European Union and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. 
China, the Philippines and Burundi voted against the move, whose backers said it was supported by more than 100 countries.
Myanmar Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun said the resolution was based on the report of a U.N. fact-finding mission (FFM) that his government had categorically rejected, and which was unbalanced, one-sided and encouraged disunity of the country.
""The draft resolution is based on serious but unverified accusations and recommendations of the FFM that could even endanger the national unity of the country,"" he said.
He said the resolution's intrusive language and demands would not contribute to finding lasting resolutions to the delicate situation in Myanmar's Rakhine state.
The resolution sets up a body to ""collect, consolidate, preserve and analyze evidence of the most serious international crimes and violations of international law committed in Myanmar since 2011, and to prepare files in order to facilitate and expedite fair and independent criminal proceedings"". 
The new agency is to work closely with any future prosecution brought by the ICC, which said earlier this month that it had jurisdiction over alleged deportations of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar to Bangladesh.
A year ago, government troops led a brutal crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine state in response to attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on 30 Myanmar police posts and a military base. More than 700,000 Rohingya fled the crackdown and most are now living in refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh.
The FFM report said Myanmar's military had carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Rohingya with ""genocidal intent"" and called for commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing and five named generals to be prosecuted for the gravest crimes.
In Thursday's resolution, the Council said there was enough information to warrant a competent court ""to determine their liability for genocide"". 

Chinese diplomat Chen Cheng told the Council that Beijing opposed the resolution because it was very likely to exacerbate the tensions. ""This is in no one's interest,"" he said.

431,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Bangladesh government to discuss tough new media law with journalists,"By Serajul Quadir
DHAKA (Reuters) - Journalist groups in Bangladesh have canceled planned protests against a new law they say cripples press freedom after the government offered talks instead.
The law, which combines some existing measures such as the colonial-era Official Secrets Act with tough new provisions, was passed by parliament on Sept. 19, three months before an expected national election. It now awaits the signature of President Abdul Hamid to come into force.
Journalist groups and unions had planned protests in Dhaka on Thursday and Saturday, but the government has now invited them to join talks expected on Sunday.
""If we can achieve our demand through discussion then that is good for all,"" said Saiful Islam, president of Dhaka Reporters Unity, a forum for journalists. 
The unions and the Editors Council of Bangladesh, which represents the country's largest daily newspapers, will attend the talks. 
""The information ministry is very much aware about the concern of the journalist community,"" Bangladesh’s Information Minister Hasanul Haq said in the letter. ""It is of the utmost necessity to sit with the Editors Council to discuss the issue, to settle the concerns and ensure free movement of information.""
MEDIA FREEDOM
The journalists' groups have called on the government to revise or drop multiple sections in the law they say stifle media freedom and breach their right to free speech. 
They are unhappy about a provision that allows police to arrest any individual without a warrant. 
There is a maximum sentence of 14 years for espionage if an individual is found secretly recording information with electronic instruments inside a government building. 
Another section imposes the same jail sentence for spreading ""propaganda and campaign"" against Bangladesh's 1971 war for independence from Pakistan. A further element journalists have opposed is the inclusion in the law of the colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which includes a sentence of up to 14 years for sharing state secrets with an enemy.
""This section of this law is a major obstacle for journalists in revealing truth,"" said Reaz Uddin Ahmed, acting chairman of the Editors Council.
Human Rights Watch has called the law a ""tool ripe for abuse and a clear violation of the country’s obligations under international law to protect free speech"". 
Critics see the law as an authoritarian move by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, already facing flak for violently suppressing protests last month by school students demanding improved road safety and over a campaign against drugs in which security forces are accused of extrajudicial killings. 
Hasina has defended the new law by saying it is aimed at controlling cyber and digital crimes.
""The journalists are only thinking about their interest, not about society and only for that they are raising their voices,"" she said this week.
Scores of people, including journalists, have been jailed in Bangladesh under Hasina's rule since 2009 for criticizing the government online.

""Iran is detaining innocent people as an instrument of diplomatic leverage and we can't accept that,"" Hunt told Sky news from New York where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly.
""I had a very, very frank discussion with the Iranian foreign minister ... and I made it very clear that our policy to Iran is not settled and there will be consequences if they continue to think that this is a tool of diplomacy,"" he added.
Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested in April 2016 at a Tehran airport as she headed back to Britain with her daughter after a family visit.
She was sentenced to five years in jail after being convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran's clerical establishment, a charge denied by her family and the Foundation, a charity organization that operates independently of Thomson Reuters and Reuters News.
""Iran needs to understand that we will not let it rest,"" Hunt said.
Earlier this week, British Prime Minister Theresa May also lobbied for the release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe during a meeting in New York with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, May's office said.
Replying a question about dual nationals in Iranian jails, including Nazanin, Rouhani was quoted as saying by Fars news agency in a news conference in New York on Wednesday:
“From a humanitarian perspective, we should all try to help people in jail. The Iranian government is doing what it can, trying to facilitate visits and access to information. But the trial and verdict are in the hands of the judiciary. It’s the same in all countries.” 

Britain has advised British-Iranian dual nationals against all but essential travel to Iran, tightening its existing travel advice and warning it has only limited powers to support them if detained.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The city of Brussels named a square on Thursday after Jo Cox, the British lawmaker murdered during the Brexit referendum campaign, in a ceremony where her family lamented the continued ferocity of political debate.
""After Jo was killed, it felt like there was a real hope that some things would change,"" her sister Kim Leadbeater told a gathering at the newly named ""place Jo Cox"" in the city center that was attended by Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.
""However,"" Leadbeater went on, ""Over two years later, and despite many people working extremely hard to ensure that Jo's murder was not in vain, I'm sadly not at all sure that this is the case.""
A former campaigner for foreign aid once based in the EU capital, Cox was 41 and a prominent Labour voice for keeping Britain in the European Union when she was attacked in her constituency by a man who shouted ""Keep Britain independent"".
Her killing a week before the vote in June 2016 led to a suspension of campaigning and a national debate on the anger the referendum had sparked on both sides -- a polarization that persists as Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May struggles to agree a deal with the EU to smooth Britain's exit next March.
Corbyn, who has long been ambivalent about EU membership, told Labour's annual conference on Wednesday that the party would vote against May's current proposals. After the ceremony, he met EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.

The modest square named in her honor is in a downtown area Cox knew well; the gesture by the city council is part of a drive to ensure more streets are named after women.

DAMASCUS (Reuters) - Mohammed Abu al-Khair sends 25 buses a day from the Syrian capital Damascus to Aleppo, an eight-hour trip that until recently took up to two days.
The reduction in the journey time is a result of military gains by the Syrian army which have eased the movement of goods and people in government-held areas after years of paralysis because of the civil war that began in 2011. 
The opening of roads that for years were unsafe has also brought some economic payoff for President Bashar al-Assad from the army's military successes. 
(GRAPHIC: Highways across Syria - https://tmsnrt.rs/2N6mYlw)
""Previously it could take two days to reach Aleppo. It was very dangerous for the drivers,"" said Abu al-Khair, who oversees operations for Amir bus company, including from Damascus to Aleppo, a city 310 km (192 miles) north of Damascus which was an industrial hub before the war.
Vehicles now travel day and night, not only in the half of Syria controlled by Assad, but also to the quarter of it held by a U.S.-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias. 
Syria's economy has been shattered. Whole towns lie in ruins, many workers have fled, been killed or gone to fight, and international sanctions hobble external trade.
But Assad is turning his attention toward a gradual economic recovery in areas he controls. 
Finance Minister Mamoun Hamdan said last month that economic activity had picked up significantly, and that a move to issue foreign currency deposits was aimed at funding trade operations as the government moved towards reconstruction.
Internal Trade Minister Abdullah Gharbi told Reuters that internal trade had risen by more than 30 percent since the government retook major roads.
""It's easier. Less time, less risk,"" said Majd Wehbeh, executive manager of Compass Freight and Logistics in Damascus.
For much of the seven-year conflict safe, rapid travel was unthinkable as fighting cut major routes and splintered the country into dozens of warring fiefdoms. 
Conditions are still difficult - far worse than the situation before 2011. Most borders are closed. Roads are controlled by numerous checkpoints at which, companies say, soldiers routinely demand bribes. 
Yet the situation is incomparable to earlier periods of the war, when travelers might be kidnapped or killed in clashes, and many areas were unreachable.
DANGER
The old network of major highways is now open from the Lebanese and - currently closed - Jordanian border through Damascus, Homs and Hama, to the ports of Tartous and Latakia, and to Deir al-Zor in eastern Syria. 
It had been difficult and dangerous to reach Deir al-Zor, deep in Islamic State territory. Abdullah al-Mallah, buying a bus ticket for his hometown of al-Mayadin near Deir al-Zor, said he now traveled between it and Damascus every week or two. 
When he fled Islamic State rule for Damascus in 2016, it took weeks to cross the desert. It now takes nine hours and a $12 ticket. His family might join him for a trip soon, he said. 
Farah bus company runs five or six buses there a day. It occasionally sent buses even when Islamic State controlled the desert, its manager Yahya Khatib said, charging $100 a ticket. 
Sometimes it took a bus two months to find a safe route back to government territory. ""There's no danger now. Things are normal,"" he said. 
Assad's military gains this year suddenly eased conditions, freight and bus companies said. 
The recapture of eastern Ghouta, located by the main highway that runs north from Damascus, meant traffic no longer had to traverse a 90-minute diversion through the hills outside the capital. 
Qadmous company carries cargo between Damascus and the coast. ""During the war we reduced our work by a lot. Now it's 40 or 50 percent higher,"" said Michel Dagher, the company overseer. 
He and the Compass Freight manager Wehbeh both said the number of army checkpoints, as well as journey times, had been reduced by a lot. 
BLOCKED
International routes are still blocked. Syria's only working border now is with Lebanon, though there are talks to reopen the Nassib frontier with Jordan. 
The main crossing with Iraq is blocked by a U.S. military base on the Damascus-Baghdad highway. Another crossing at Albu Kamal is open for military, but not general use. Syria's border with Turkey is open only in rebel-held areas. 
Internally, it is still split. From government territory, it is possible to travel into areas controlled by a Kurdish-led administration in the northeast. In Damascus, bus companies advertised daily journeys there. 
But it is hard to reach rebel-held territory in Idlib and northern Aleppo. Travelers are dropped off near a safe foot corridor across the front line, a bus driver said. 
As the internal economy gradually recovers, the government wants to shift more freight off the roads onto more efficient rail lines. 
The main Damascus station reopened this month, but only to serve a short route to a trade fair. Najib Fares, head of Syrian railways, said work had started to restore the main line. 
""We are maintaining, repairing and reconstructing the railway line... there is very major damage on this line,"" he said. 
As a train pulled into the platform behind Fares, a line of shell-smashed buildings stretched back to the horizon and rusted, shell-damaged carriages lay idle in a siding. 
It was a reminder of how difficult Syria's recovery will be, and that the war still intrudes in many regions. 
The highways to Aleppo from Latakia and Hama in Idlib province remain in rebel hands and travel there now involves a long detour along narrow roads. 
Kamal, a Hama-based bus driver who did not want to give his surname, said restoring that road would cut hours of journey time. Army victories had already saved hours in driving between Hama and Damascus, he said.
""It used to be one trip per day and then return the next day. Now I come and go in the same day. So do some of my passengers,"" he said.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's foreign minister asked Canada to apologize for demanding the release of Saudi women's rights activists and stop treating the kingdom as ""a banana republic"" if it wanted to resolve a diplomatic dispute between the two countries.
In August, Saudi Arabia froze new trade with Canada, blocked grain imports, expelled Canada's ambassador and ordered all Saudi students home after Ottawa called for the release of activists detained for urging more rights for women.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Tuesday she hoped to meet with her Saudi counterpart Adel al-Jubeir this week on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. 
""It is outrageous from our perspective that a country will sit there and lecture us and make demands ... We demand the immediate release and independence of Quebec, granting of equal rights to Canadian Indians. What on earth are you talking about?,"" al-Jubeir said at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on Wednesday night.
""You can criticize us about human rights, women's rights ... others do and that's your right. You can sit down and talk about it, but demand the immediate release? What are we a banana republic? Would any country accept it? No! We don't,"" al-Jubeir said.
The dispute arose from Canada's criticism over the arrests, including that of prominent women's rights campaigner Samar Badawi. Her brother Raif Badawi, a prominent blogger, is serving a 10-year sentence and has been publicly flogged for expressing dissenting opinions online. His wife and children live in Canada and are Canadian citizens.
A number of women's rights activists, who campaigned for the right to drive and an end to the kingdom's male guardianship system, have been targeted in a government crackdown in recent months, human rights' groups say. 
""We don't want to be a political football in Canada's domestic politics. Find another ball to play with. It's very easy to fix. Apologize and say you made a mistake,"" al-Jubeir said.
Freeland said on Tuesday that Ottawa would not be changing its fundamental position.
""Canada will always stand up for human rights ... we feel a particular obligation to women who are fighting for their rights around the world,"" she said. ""And we feel a particular obligation to people who have a personal connection to Canada."" 
Germany and Saudi Arabia agreed earlier this week to end a diplomatic dispute. The spat started last November when Germany's foreign minister at the time, Sigmar Gabriel, condemned ""adventurism"" in the Middle East, comments seen as an attack on increasingly assertive Saudi policies, notably in Yemen.

President Paul Biya is expected to easily extend his 36-year rule in the Oct. 7 vote but the insurgency by Anglophone rebels has emerged as his government's most serious challenge in years. 
The separatists complain of discrimination against English speakers in the predominantly Francophone country and want to create an independent state called Ambazonia in the oil and cocoa-producing northwest and southwest regions.
Their hit-and-run raids have killed more than 160 members of Cameroon's security forces in the past year, Amnesty International has said. State forces have also shot at civilians from helicopters, burned villages and killed residents, forcing thousands to flee.
Nchia Martin Achuo, the head of the Tigers of Ambazonia, a separatist group that says it has around 2,000 fighters, said his men had attacked the prison in the northwest town of Wum around 4 a.m. on Wednesday and freed 106 ""innocent people"". 
""There was a shootout between our boys and the prison guards,"" he said. ""I heard that they (government soldiers) have been arresting innocent people on the street. They are not criminals in that prison.""
""NO ELECTION IN AMBAZONIA""
Government spokesman Issa Tchiroma Bakary confirmed the separatists had freed about 100 prisoners but did not provide additional details. 
Martin and the leader of another separatist group, Cho Ayaba, both vowed to prevent the presidential election from going ahead in Anglophone Cameroon. Separatists have set up check points blocking traffic on major roads, helping to paralyze activity across the region. 
""There will be no election in Ambazonia,"" Ayaba told Reuters. ""We want to make sure there is no movement from Cameroon into Ambazonia, including election materials."" 
The governments in the Anglophone regions have imposed curfews and other security restrictions in recent weeks in order to contain the violence and ensure the vote can take place. 
Cameroon's linguistic divide harks back to the end of World War One, when the League of Nations divided the former German colony of Kamerun between the allied French and British victors.
Biya has ruled virtually by decree since taking office in 1982. Of Africa's living leaders, only Equatorial Guinea's President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo has ruled uninterrupted for longer.

General Assembly: Iran president,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Thursday the United States had nothing to show for its appearance at the U.N. General Assembly this week, extending an exchange of insults with Tehran's arch-adversary.
President Donald Trump used his annual address to the General Assembly on Tuesday to denounce Iran as a ""corrupt dictatorship"" whose leaders ""sow chaos, death and destruction"", and told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday that Washington was pursuing further sanctions against the Islamic Republic.
Rouhani, in his General Assembly speech, suggested Trump suffered from a ""weakness of intellect"" after having withdrawn the United States from big powers' 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, a move that dismayed European allies of Washington.
At a news conference on Thursday following his return to Tehran, Rouhani said of the annual U.N. gathering, ""The Americans had no achievements in this public assembly.
""When Mr. Trump was speaking and at the beginning of his speech bragged a lot about the accomplishments of his-two year old administration, everyone laughed,"" Rouhani said.
""What's important is that today, other than one or two countries, no one is supporting America,"" he said. ""It's a historic political isolation that is rare for America.""
Separately, Iranian Defence Minister Amir Hatami said that Iran would not bow to intensifying U.S. economic pressure.
Washington imposed new sanctions on Iran in August, targeting its trade in gold and other precious metals, purchases of U.S. dollars and its car industry. Trump has said the United States will issue another round of tougher sanctions in November aimed at crippling Iran's oil sales and banking sector.
""The Americans say that by imposing sanctions they want to pressure the government of Iran but in reality with this method they deprive the people of their welfare and right to life,"" Hatami said, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency.
""America and the Zionist regime (Israel) are trying to block the people of Iran from their revolutionary path and movement with economic pressure and cruel sanctions. But they should know that today we are self-sufficient and independent with regard to military products and have no dependence on any power in the world,"" Hatami said, as quoted by IRNA.
Trump denounced the 2015 nuclear deal, signed before he took office, as flawed in Iran's favor and for not also curbing its ballistic missile program or role in regional conflicts, and he used the Security Council session to defend his decision.

""The Syrian regime's butchery is enabled by Russia and Iran,"" Trump said with respect to Syria's civil war.

441,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 09:08AM ET</span>","Special Report: As a Saudi prince rose, the Bin Laden business empire crumbled","By Katie Paul, Tom Arnold, Marwa Rashad and Stephen Kalin
JEDDAH/RIYADH (Reuters) - Soon after Prince Mohammed bin Salman became second in line to the throne of Saudi Arabia, he turned his sights to the sprawling empire of the Saudi Binladin Group.
In 2015, the prince, then 29, approached Bakr bin Laden, chairman of the family-owned construction giant, and told him he wanted to become a partner in the firm, according to six people briefed on the exchange.
The prince pitched his offer as a patriotic opportunity to help transform the kingdom's oil-dependent economy. It would also, he said, ease the financial strain on the company as the government reined in infrastructure spending to cope with a drop in oil prices.
As head of the Saudi royal family's favored building contractor, Bakr bin Laden was accustomed to obliging royal requests. But he hesitated at the prince's approach, these sources said. The construction mogul replied that he needed time to consult other family shareholders.
In the months that followed, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known by many simply as MbS, grew more powerful, rising to crown prince in June 2017. He championed economic reform and took aim at widespread corruption.
The Bin Ladens, in contrast, experienced a dramatic fall from grace.
Three Bin Laden brothers, senior executives in the family firm, were among more than 200 businessmen, royals and officials detained in November 2017 in an anti-corruption drive ordered by the prince. Bakr and two of his brothers, Saleh and Saad, eventually transferred their combined 36.2 percent stake in the family firm to the state in April 2018. Bakr, in his late 60s, is still in custody, although no charges have been made public.
Reuters spoke to more than two dozen Saudi Binladin Group employees, family friends, government officials, bankers and businessmen to tell the story of the fall of the Bin Ladens. Few of the sources would go on the record, citing the Bin Ladens' long-standing preference for privacy and restrictions on public criticism of the Saudi government. These sources charted the family's reversal of fortune, starting with that 2015 exchange between Bakr and Prince Mohammed and ending with the state taking management control of the family firm.
The Bin Ladens' undoing exposes the contradictions in Prince Mohammed's plan to build a modern economy, some economists say. He has embraced privatization, hoping to inject dynamism, yet the state has intervened in firms such as Saudi Binladin Group. He has tackled corruption, yet there has been little transparency around the process. One Saudi businessman said the Bin Laden saga had become a ""symbol of what's happening between the government and the private sector - a breakdown of trust.""
Asked to comment, a senior government official said Prince Mohammed did not seek a stake in Saudi Binladin Group in 2015. The Saudi government, he added, had saved the company from collapse after it experienced financial difficulties ""coupled with extensive supervisory and governance weakness."" Saudi Binladin Group was ""a vital Saudi commercial entity,"" he said. The Bin Laden family and its representatives did not respond to a request for comment.
NEW KING, NEW RULES
The Bin Laden clan has known trouble before: The black sheep of the family, Osama, masterminded the attacks on America of Sept. 11, 2001. But the Bin Ladens, led by Bakr, survived that storm. Their reckoning began with King Abdullah's death in January 2015.
Saudi Binladin Group had grown from humble beginnings in 1931, nourished by the Bin Laden family's good relations with successive rulers. Royal contracts were arranged informally, sometimes scribbled on paper over coffee.
""It was the 'inshallah bukra' [God willing, tomorrow] way of doing business, with a meeting that might have been scheduled for 11 a.m. in the office, rescheduled to 4 p.m. and then actually taking place at 2 a.m. at the palace,"" said Thomas Fallows, an American banker who worked in Riyadh for eight years.
In the last months of King Abdullah's life, oil prices tumbled to $60 a barrel from above $100 at their peak, slashing the kingdom's revenues. By the time 79-year-old King Salman acceded to the throne, projects commissioned in the boom years were becoming a burden. These included a Riyadh financial district, an airport in Jeddah and an economic city on the Red Sea coast.
Salman quickly appointed Prince Mohammed, a previously little-known son, as deputy crown prince. Mohammed also took control of the kingdom's important economic and defense portfolios.
As a teenager, Prince Mohammed had regularly attended meetings with his father, Riyadh's governor at the time, but left little impression, said a former senior Western diplomat. But Salman saw in the boy qualities he prized, according to Saudi and Western sources. ""Clever, rugged, understands the locals,"" said one Western policy adviser. Other princes went abroad, but Prince Mohammed stayed in Saudi Arabia, earning a law degree and investing in the Riyadh stock market. By the time Salman became king, the young prince was sitting in on meetings with foreign officials and silently communicating with his father via iPad, the former Western diplomat said.
Reform-minded and ambitious, Prince Mohammed was keen to challenge the status quo. He introduced changes to streamline government, diversify the economy and cut costs, including slashing construction spending. One of the new government's first moves in 2015 was to order a review of state contracts, with a focus on the big projects on which Saudi Binladin Group depended, said two sources.
Asked about the results of this review, the senior government official said, ""The government is keen to review all projects, including those contracts that may have a suspicion of corruption or negligence in their sites.""
Prince Mohammed encouraged Saudi Binladin Group to sell shares in an initial public offering, according to seven sources familiar with the discussions, part of efforts to develop the kingdom's capital markets. The Bin Ladens had previously shelved IPO plans begun in 2011, worried that they would not get a good price in a stock market battered by low oil prices, and put off by the red tape involved in a share issue. The family was reluctant to revive the idea in 2015, when market conditions were worse, these seven sources said.
Asked to comment, the senior government official denied that Prince Mohammed had promoted the idea that Saudi Binladin Group should sell shares in an IPO.
Then, in September 2015, a construction crane owned by Saudi Binladin Group collapsed in Mecca's Grand Mosque, killing 107 people just before the start of Islam's annual haj pilgrimage. The government moved against the company, suspending it from receiving new state contracts and barring its board members and senior executives from traveling abroad. It also ordered the Finance Ministry to review the firm's existing projects, citing unspecified ""shortcomings.""
A senior Saudi Binladin Group executive and a source close to the family said the crane accident gave the government an opening to act against the firm. The executive said Saudi Binladin Group wasn't responsible for the site at the time - the work fell under the supervision of local authorities in Mecca. The senior government official disputed this, saying it was standard practice that the contractor supervised the site. A legal case over the incident was still pending, he added.
The Bin Laden family ""took the slap on the hand and accepted it,"" the executive said. ""They would never speak out against the king or the crown prince. They are loyal servants.""
The family tried to limit the damage. Bakr sent a letter to brother Saleh formally handing him responsibility for the company, hoping that a change of management would placate the government, according to two people who saw the letter. But the plan didn't work. As payments from the state dried up, Saudi Binladin Group's finances deteriorated and it stopped paying tens of thousands of its workers, leading to riots. By mid-2016, much of the group's construction work was stalled, including at projects essential to Prince Mohammed's reform plans.
Again the Bin Ladens tried to defuse the situation. Saudi Binladin Group hired dozens of finance and management professionals from overseas, including former  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) banker Klaus Froehlich as chief financial officer. Froehlich, who remains CFO, came armed with years of experience in Saudi deal making. He also had ties to Mohammed al-Jadaan, who would soon be appointed finance minister, two sources said. Al-Jadaan did not respond to a request for comment.
Creditors who had been struggling to reach Saudi Binladin Group during its crisis said communication improved after Froehlich arrived. Government payments started coming through again. Financial pressure eased. The company also put plans for a public stock offering back on the table, bowing to state pressure to ""recycle"" some of the money it had made over the decades back into the kingdom, according to six people familiar with the plans. It appeared that relations between the Bin Ladens and the government were on the mend.
But the detente would not last long. Saudi Arabia was careening toward a recession, and market conditions for a listing were worsening. To the government's irritation, the stock offering plans stalled again because of this deteriorating environment. ""The rulers and MbS saw [the Bin Ladens] as a leech sucking the lifeblood out of Saudi Arabia but offering nothing in return,"" said one person who had worked on the company's restructuring. ""They ran out of patience.""
In June 2017, Prince Mohammed replaced his cousin, security chief Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir apparent, further centralizing the levers of power. More than ever, Prince Mohammed was in a position to do something about the Bin Ladens.
DOWNFALL
On the night of Nov. 4, 2017, Saudi authorities detained Bakr bin Laden in Jeddah along with more than 200 other members of the Saudi elite, in what officials said was a crackdown on corruption. Dozens of Bin Laden family members, including the brothers' children, had their bank accounts frozen and were banned from traveling abroad, said associates of the family. Brothers who were abroad at the time were recalled to the kingdom.
For Bakr, it was the beginning of a detention that has lasted more than 10 months. Like many others, he was first held at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh. So were his brothers Saleh and Saad, fellow major shareholders. Other Bin Laden brothers - Omar, Ahmed, Mohammed, Abdullah and Yehya among them - were brought to the hotel for shorter periods, according to four family associates.
The purge affected royals, ministers and business leaders. The Bin Laden family's hometown of Jeddah, once the economic capital of Saudi Arabia, was particularly hard hit. Many of the city's merchant families had maintained close relationships with previous kings; few of them were spared in the crackdown.
The government publicly has not said precisely why the Bin Ladens - or any of the other individuals caught up in the anti-corruption campaign - were detained. King Salman said at the time the purge was in response to ""exploitation by some of the weak souls who have put their own interests above the public interest, in order to, illicitly, accrue money.""
Two sources said the Bin Laden brothers received little attention in the hotel and were left alone in their rooms watching TV and eating room service. One family associate said a younger brother told him he was never informed why he was there, had no access to a lawyer and was barely visited by interrogators. Like others in the Ritz, they were made to keep the doors to their rooms open and a doctor came to check on them regularly. Authorities also employed a notary to facilitate the changing of power of attorney on assets. One brother described it bluntly to a friend upon his release: ""It was a shitty experience.""
Asked to comment, the senior government official referred Reuters to statements issued at the time by the kingdom's Attorney General. These statements said suspects had ""the same rights and treatment as any other Saudi citizen.""
""Everyone is presumed innocent until proven guilty, and everyone's legal rights will be preserved,"" Attorney General Sheikh Saud Al Mojeb said on Nov. 5, 2017.
The Ritz was cleared of prisoners in late January but Bakr is still in detention in Riyadh, able to receive visits only from his immediate family members, according to five people familiar with the situation. Asked about Bakr's whereabouts and the status of the investigation, the senior government official referred Reuters to the Attorney General. The Attorney General did not respond to a request for comment.
The other brothers are at home in Jeddah, but keeping a low profile. Saleh, the most gregarious, has returned to playing card games with friends, said one acquaintance. Stripped of many of his assets, including a palace in Jeddah bestowed by King Abdullah, he has been visiting banks to ask for help, according to one lender. ""He's putting a brave face on,"" the lender said.
Authorities seized the title deeds to the homes of senior brothers, including Bakr's villa overlooking the Red Sea, as part of settlements for their release, four sources said. The state also took private jets, cash, jewelry and Saad's $90 million automobile collection, which included limited edition Ferraris and other rare Italian cars, said two sources. Bakr's son Nawaf was relieved of every Maserati in his personal showroom.
Asked to comment, the senior government official referred Reuters to the Attorney General's Office. It did not respond. In a statement at the time of the Ritz detentions, Attorney General Saud Al Mojeb estimated that corruption and embezzlement had cost Saudi Arabia at least $100 billion over several decades. In Dec. 2017, he said most detainees faced with corruption allegations had agreed to a ""settlement,"" involving assets including real estate, cash and securities.
THE TAKEOVER
The core of the Bin Laden family's settlement with the government involved the conglomerate itself.
On April 23, the government finalised the transfer of 36.2 percent of the company, representing the shares held by Bakr, Saleh and Saad, to an entity called Istidama Holding Company, according to a Commerce Ministry document reviewed by Reuters. Two people who have dealt with Istidama said it was set up by the Ministry of Finance to park the proceeds of settlements agreed between the government and individuals detained in the corruption purge. The senior government official confirmed to Reuters that the Ministry of Finance owns Istidama. There are no public filings about Istidama because it is not a listed firm, and Reuters was unable to contact the company.
The government established a five-man committee to oversee the running of Saudi Binladin Group. Its members include Abdulrehman al-Harkan, a former chief executive of Riyadh-based developer Dar Al Arkan; Khaled Nahas, a board member of petrochemical producer Saudi Basic Industries Corp; and Khalid al-Khowaiter, chief financial officer at Advanced Electronics Company, a state-established technology firm. These government appointees are considered by many close to the company to be a front for the rulers. ""The bottom line is that the government has taken over,"" said one banker in Jeddah.
Harkan, Nahas and Khowaiter did not respond to requests for comment. The senior government official said the supervisory committee was ""an independent committee that represents the interests of all partners.""
The remaining two-thirds of Saudi Binladin Group are still held by 15 younger Bin Laden brothers, according to the Commerce Ministry document. Two family representatives were appointed to the oversight committee - Yehya, who ran the back office, and Abdullah, a Harvard-educated lawyer who handled the conglomerate's interests in the United States. Several sources interpreted their inclusion as a token gesture by the government. The brothers and their representatives did not respond to requests for comment.
The void left by the family's diminished role was filled by Harkan, the developer, who reports to the royal court and to Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan, according to the group executive. As chairman of the committee and the effective head of Saudi Binladin Group, Harkan was involved in securing an 11 billion riyal ($3 billion) loan from the Ministry of Finance in April. He has also met with creditors, primarily local banks, to offer reassurances about the group's future. Harkan told those present that the company was a ""mess and hopelessly insolvent,"" but that he had been appointed by King Salman to lead its turnaround, said one attendee. To the incredulity of some of those listening, Harkan also explained the brothers were ""relieved to be absolved of their responsibilities.""
Despite those assurances, the company's future remains uncertain. As Harkan has told creditors, plans drawn up after Froehlich was hired will be dusted off. The estimated 537 companies that make up the conglomerate, from construction to energy, will be broken up and the name of the company changed to distance it from the Bin Laden legacy.
Also at issue is money owed to Saudi Binladin Group. After the Ritz detentions, what one source described as an ""army of accountants"" began combing through the company's books, trying to make sense of the government's liabilities to the firm. A person close to the family gauged it at nearly $40 billion. A company director estimated the amount was smaller. The senior government official said the government had no liabilities to the firm, but there were ""some disputed payments among several government agencies that are being addressed.""
LIFE AFTER THE BIN LADENS
Saudi Binladin Group has 93 projects in hand and ties to 1,400 subcontractors, but most of its work is on hold. The company is focusing its efforts on delivering one massive project, commissioned by Prince Mohammed. The project is NEOM, a $500 billion business zone on the Red Sea coast that is the centrepiece of Mohammed's vision for a modern, dynamic Saudi Arabia. The city will have its own legal system designed to attract international investors in high tech industries such as biotechnology, advanced manufacturing and tourism.
But the first buildings commissioned at the site were more traditional - opulent seaside palaces. These included a replica of the palace that Saudi Binladin Group completed for King Salman in Tangier, Morocco, said three sources, one of them working at the site. According to a project design document reviewed by Reuters, the site has palaces for the king, Prince Mohammed and his brother Prince Turki, as well as smaller villas for other royal brothers and ""family princes."" Landscaped with fountains and flowering trees, the complex will also feature three helipads, a marina and a golf course.
Contracts for the palaces originally went to other Saudi construction firms. But according to the source at the project site and two other sources, those companies were unable to handle the scale and speed of the project.
Tens of thousands of Binladin workers were diverted from other projects around the country. They worked 24/7 at breakneck pace to deliver, toiling through the sweltering summer months, said three sources. Grass planted outside the palaces did not grow quickly enough for the Aug. 1 deadline, so the workers had to replace it with artificial turf before the royal arrival. The senior government official confirmed that a subsidiary of Saudi Binladin Group was involved in the building work.
Prince Mohammed took regular flights around the project to survey its progress, according to four people familiar with the matter. Two of them said he has taken charge of marketing NEOM himself, bringing in prospective investors for official tours and alcohol-free parties. At the end of July, he and the king moved to the unfinished complex for their summer holiday. With no other structures on site, trailing cabinet members and business leaders stayed on yachts or in the nearby town of Sharma.
Once again, the kingdom needed the knowhow of Saudi Binladin Group.

442,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 09:01AM ET</span>","A year after failed independence bid, Iraq's Kurds vote for parliament","By Raya Jalabi and Ahmed Aboulenein
ERBIL/SULAIMANIYA, Iraq (Reuters) - A year after a failed bid for independence, Iraq's Kurds will be voting again on Sunday, this time in a parliamentary election that could disrupt the delicate balance of power in their semi-autonomous region.
With opposition parties weak, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) are likely to extend their almost three decades of sharing power. 
But splits within the PUK present the possibility that Masoud Barzani's KDP will take a dominant position in Kurdish politics, both in the regional capital Erbil and in the difficult formation of a federal government in Baghdad.
The contentious referendum on independence in 2017, led by Barzani, promised to set Iraq's Kurds on a path to a homeland. 
Instead, a swift backlash from Baghdad dashed those prospects and diminished the region's autonomy.
Speaking on the vote's first anniversary, Barzani, who stepped down as Kurdish president in the aftermath, told thousands of flag-waving men in Erbil: ""We will never give up our dignity or honor.""
But Barzani - still the KDP's leader and main vote-getter - also added that ""even 1,000 years of war won't solve the problem"".
Even though relations with Baghdad have improved, the Kurdish region has lost territory and economic autonomy, and voter frustration is rising. 
""This is the first time that I'm not voting,"" said Ahmed Abdullah, a 68-year-old retiree. ""The two parties in power steal and lie, and that's how they stay in power. I've stopped believing anything will change.""
""NOTHING EVER CHANGES""
Abdullah had been a supporter of the PUK, the second largest party, led by the Talabani family and based around Sulaimaniya.
The PUK and the Erbil-based Barzani clan's KDP together form a dynastic duopoly predicated on patronage in the regions they respectively control. But years of stagnant politics, unpaid salaries and corruption have undermined faith in politics and shrunk the turnout in recent elections.
The situation was not helped by the suspension of parliament between 2015 and 2017 due to in-fighting. 
""What's the point of voting? Nothing ever changes, whether we vote or not. Things just get worse,"" said 38-year-old teacher Alan Baram.
Senior KDP leader Hoshyar Zebari acknowledged that allegations of Kurdish fraud in May's federal election had undermined public confidence, and said Sunday's vote was ""critical to restoring the legitimacy of our institutions"".
But most major parties say they do not expect more than about 40 percent of the 3.85 million registered voters to go to the polls - below even the record low of 44.5 percent who voted in the federal election.
A low turnout could benefit the KDP and PUK, whose voters tend to be more committed, respecting their role in establishing autonomy after the Gulf War of 1991.
The KDP also commands some respect for ushering in the referendum, despite the negative consequences for the region, while the PUK has yet to heal the internal rifts that opened when its founder Jalal Talabani died in 2017.
ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD
Those PUK divisions have not been helped by the decision of Barham Salih to quit the opposition Coalition for Democracy and Justice, which he founded, in order to rejoin the PUK and seek the Iraqi presidency.
Salih's former party has all but collapsed and, further clearing the field for the KDP, the main opposition party, Gorran, is still rebuilding after the death of its charismatic leader in 2017.
All opposition parties were further weakened by dismal showings in May's federal election, amid multiple allegations - not confirmed in the subsequent recount - of fraud by the two main parties. 
""If there's widespread fraud again, all opposition parties will be diminished,"" said Attah Mohammed of the Kurdistan Islamic Group, a sentiment echoed by other opposition leaders. 
The election will cast a shadow in Baghdad, where the KDP and PUK are competing for the post of federal president, reserved for Kurds ever since a U.S.-led coalition toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.
Though historically the position has been filled by the PUK, the KDP have fielded their own candidate.
Kamal Chomani, non-resident fellow at the Washington-based Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, said that, despite no longer being president of Kurdistan, Barzani hoped to be seen as the pre-eminent Kurdish leader:
""He wants all the players to come and see him in Erbil any time they need to deal with the Kurds.""
Whether that kind of power politics will inspire many to vote appears doubtful.

""I only ever voted in the referendum because that was for Kurdistan,"" said 20-year-old fruit-seller Mostafa Ali in Erbil. ""These elections are for the parties, not for Kurdistan.""

443,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>","In legal battle over gay sex, Kenyan court to consider Indian ruling","By John Ndiso and Cecilie Kallestrup
NAIROBI (Reuters) - Parties involved in a court case seeking to decriminalize gay sex in Kenya will be allowed to make submissions based on a recent decision by India’s top court to overturn a ban on gay sex, a Kenyan court said on Thursday.
India's top court on Sept. 6 scrapped a colonial-era law that punished gay sex with up to 10 years in jail, raising hopes among activists worldwide, including in Africa, for similar reforms elsewhere. 
The constitutional division of Kenya's High Court will hear submissions from both parties on Oct. 25 on the relevance of India's decision to Kenya, given that both countries have shared the law - dating back to the days of British colonial rule - that criminalizes ""sexual acts against the order of nature"".
Homosexuality is taboo across much of Africa and gay people face discrimination or persecution. In Kenya it can lead to a 14-year jail sentence, but in recent years campaigners for lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender (LGBT) rights have become increasingly vocal.
Opponents of decriminalizing gay sex in Kenya say India’s decision was flawed and they will ask the Kenyan court to disregard it.
""Kenyan courts are bound only by decisions of higher courts in Kenya, but decisions of foreign courts can be persuasive. They don't have to be adopted,"" said Charles Kanjama, a lawyer representing parties against decriminalization.
DISCRIMINATION
Supporters of decriminalization say the current ban is being used daily to discriminate against LGBT people, making it harder for them to get a job or promotion, rent housing or access health and education services.
Due to a lack of legal protection, campaigners say sexual minorities are routinely abused, assaulted by mobs, raped by police or vigilantes, or enslaved by criminals.
Last week’s decision by a Kenyan court temporarily lifting a ban on an acclaimed film called ‘Rafiki’ which had been censored by the government for portraying a lesbian relationship, raised hopes in the LGBT community that the court may be softening its view on same-sex relationships.
Although the movie screened to a sold-out crowd on Sunday, it drew sharp criticism from the Kenyan censor who said it still considered ‘Rafiki’ morally subversive.
However, parties against decriminalization in the current case say that ‘Rafiki’ is unlikely to change opinion of the court on homosexuality. 
""The views of that proportion of the population that watch it are unlikely to change, because those may be part of the three or four percent who already have very ambivalent views about this issue,"" Kanjama said.
Same-sex relationships are a crime in more than 70 countries around the world, almost half of them in Africa. South Africa is the only African nation to have legalized gay marriage. 
The law against gay sex in Kenya was introduced during British rule more than 120 years ago. In 2010 Kenya adopted a new constitution that provides for equality, human dignity and freedom from discrimination.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will wait until November before kicking off full-blown preparations for a possible collapse of Brexit talks, diplomats said, reluctantly accepting that such a scenario would still require some managing. 
EU envoys of the 27 countries remaining in the bloc after Brexit discussed on Wednesday stepping up contingency planning should no agreement with Britain emerge on how to run the unprecedented process.
""We will wait for if and when the negotiations with Britain officially fail to kickstart more open work among the 27 on preparing for a no-deal,"" a senior EU diplomat said. ""We've given ourselves until November.""
The 27 EU leaders have agreed to meet on the weekend of Nov. 17-18 to sign off on any agreement with Britain, which on March 29, 2019, will become the first country ever to leave the bloc.
""There are areas where we need to act to have something in place on March 30th no matter what,"" the diplomat said. 
The European Commission, the EU's executive, confirmed on Thursday it was preparing for the possibility of Britain leaving the bloc without a divorce deal or an outline of their future relations, but reiterated it was working to conclude a treaty.
""The EU continues to work for an orderly Brexit and an ambitious future partnership with the UK that should include a close economic relationship,"" the Commission's Michel Barnier said.
Barnier, the EU's Brexit negotiator, was due to meet the head of Britain's main opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, on Thursday. Corbyn has said Labour would vote against a Brexit deal based on Prime Minister Theresa May's current proposals. 
That has added to EU worries that, even if they secure a deal with May, it could be rejected in the British parliament, where both Labour and some in May's deeply divided Conservative Party could vote against it.
NO-DEAL DEALS
Some EU diplomats and officials have reacted with irony to dozens of no-deal guidance papers issued recently by London, saying they envisage a lot of cooperation - and trust - between the sides even in the case of negotiations breaking down.
""That's a lot of deals assumed on the British side for a no-deal scenario,"" said a second diplomat dealing with Brexit in Brussels. ""But it's probably true that for some areas like air traffic we will have to make sure we go on.""
While a temporary extension of existing rules could work for air traffic or mutual assurances of citizens' rights, they would be more problematic in areas such as customs.
Germany's Brexit pointman Alex Dittman said the EU-27 still believed ""a deal is much better than a no-deal for all parties involved"". 
""But of course we need preparedness for all outcomes on national level as well as EU level,"" he said.
The future customs border is the key point of contention in the negotiations as the sides differ deeply over how to avoid installing border checks between EU state Ireland and Britain's province of Northern Ireland after Brexit, something they fear could upset the island's Good Friday peace agreement. 
Both sides appear to have dug in their heels since a meeting in Salzburg last week between May and the other 27 leaders turned sour, with the EU rejecting her plan that would see continued free trade in goods after Brexit. 
But every negotiation also has its share of political theater - something a third senior EU diplomat called ""the ritual dance"" - and each side hopes the other will blink first.
The EU and Britain are now negotiating a divorce deal. Should they agree on that and the agreement is ratified by both the British and the EU parliaments, Britain would get a status-quo adaptation period until the end of 2020.

That would delay most of the real effects of Brexit. Most EU diplomats expect that transition period to be extended as two years is unlikely to be enough to negotiate future cooperation accords on issues ranging from trade to food safety.

445,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Killing them softly: Macron's EU election man challenges Brussels political order,"By Michel Rose and Richard Lough
PARIS (Reuters) - Emmanuel Macron ripped up the French political textbook with surprising ease last year, but repeating the feat in Europe next year is a tall order when there are decades of perceived French arrogance to overcome. 
Pieyre-Alexandre Anglade, Macron's European election emissary, has a front-seat role in persuading parties from across the left-right divide to rally behind the president's drive to redraw the landscape and make Europe relevant again.
""Creating trust in politics takes time, creating trust in European politics takes more time, but creating trust in European politics when you're French takes even more time,"" the 31-year old soft-spoken lawmaker told Reuters in an interview. 
Macron, who paints next May's European elections as a battle between progressive, pro-EU reformists and populist, far-right nationalists, is out to break the old left-right duopoly that has dominated European politics in recent decades.
He has tasked Anglade with seeking out future alliance partners from the existing conservative European People's Party (EPP) and center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), as well as the smaller centrist ALDE group, to form a new movement inside the European Parliament.
""We see the system as dysfunctional and it needs rebuilding, but there's no arrogance in our approach, we're not here to say we'll destroy everything because we're the best.""
For all the professed humility, Macron is attempting nothing less than a brutal reshaping of the current political order in Brussels, just as he achieved in France, and a direct challenge to Europe's most powerful leader, Germany's Angela Merkel.
Merkel and Macron have forged a strong relationship, Anglade said, dismissing the suggestion Macron's election strategy may put him on a collision course with the German chancellor, who is keeping faith with the EPP. But he acknowledged Germany was ""the most complicated issue"" for the coming elections.
""Obviously, from this point of view, our interests are not necessarily aligned,"" Anglade said.
If Macron's future alliance is able to edge out the EPP to become the biggest grouping, it would hand him more influence over the pick of top EU jobs and more influence on EU legislation. No small feat for someone who only two years ago set up his own movement and blew apart France's two-party system. 
'NUMBER ONE FORCE'
Macron's lieutenants have held talks with Italy's center-left Democratic Party, which currently sits in the S&D group, and European Council leader Donald Tusk's Civic Platform in Poland, which is aligned with the EPP. They have also met the leaders of Spain's centrist Ciudadanos and Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of ALDE.
On Thursday, his party chief Christophe Castaner penned an opinion column in European newspapers with Italy's former prime minister Matteo Renzi, Verhofstadt and others. 
""We must act now, or the European project will stall. Worse, it could be suffocated by nationalist and populist forces,"" they co-wrote. 
Anglade said Macron's movement Republic on the Move (LREM) and ALDE shared ""intellectual proximity"". 
""But if we want to become the number one force, or a major force in the European parliament, we need to go beyond the ALDE base and be able to rally political parties which were once in the EPP, the Socialists or the Greens, in a new structure.""
""There are a certain number of parties which went to the EPP or the Socialists at one point, not because they were conservatives or Socialists, but because that's where power was and how you got posts,"" Anglade said.
Macron has not designated a leader for his European ambitions and in another challenge to Brussels has said he will not present a ""spitzenkandidat"" - a group's candidate to become the head of the European Commission. 
""The spitzenkandidat today is a man or a woman named by a political party in a dark room in Helsinki, Riga or wherever, who has no strong legitimacy,"" Anglade said.
Macron will seek businessmen, professionals and political novices to run for parliament on his party's national ticket, just as he did in France last year, Anglade said. Brussels has often been seen as a place to send political has-beens and candidates who failed at home. 

""We won't send the losers of the 2017 legislatives. And we won't send those we're fed up with in Paris to exile in Brussels,"" he said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's top court on Thursday decriminalized adultery in a landmark judgment aimed at upholding the right to equality and freedom, scrapping a law first brought in under British colonial rule in 1860.
In a unanimous judgment, the five-member bench of the top court struck down a law that meant a man who had sex with a married woman without getting her husband's permission could be charged and face up to five years in jail if convicted.
""Adultery cannot and should not be a crime. It can be a ground for a civil offense, a ground for divorce,"" Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra said while reading out the judgment.
It is the second landmark judgment in the personal sphere in India this month. Three weeks ago, the Supreme Court scrapped a colonial-era ban on gay sex.
Appearing for India's Hindu nationalist government, Additional Solicitor General Pinky Anand had argued last month that adultery should remain a criminal offense to ensure the sanctity of marriage.
While very few people have been sentenced for adultery in recent years, the threat of charges has often been used in matrimonial disputes to put pressure on women, lawyers said.
""Physicality is an individual choice,"" Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, one of the five-member bench, said in the ruling. The law was based on the concept that a woman loses her individuality once she is married, he said, adding, ""adultery is a relic of past"".
Petitioner Joseph Shine, a businessman, had challenged the constitutional validity of the adultery law, saying it discriminates against both men and women.
By exonerating wives of adultery if done with the consent of their husbands, it discriminates against women, and amounts to ""institutionalized discrimination"", the petition said.
Shine's lawyer, Kaleeswaram Raj, said that ""there is no empirical evidence that decriminalizing adultery threatens the sanctity of marriage"", adding around 80 countries do not consider extramarital affairs to be illegal.
""The judgment has unequivocally said the state has no business to interfere in aberrations in relations within a family,"" Raj, a senior lawyer in the Supreme Court, told Reuters.
Raj said the law has been widely misused even if it has rarely ended up in a jail sentence.
Whenever there are matrimonial discords or claims for maintenance, belligerent husbands have used ""malicious prosecution on the ground of adultery"", Raj said.
""In such cases, wives are helpless. They are out of the judicial process. They cannot defend themselves and the stigma the prosecution casts on them will last forever and that in itself is a punishment as far as the women are concerned.""
The court has said, however, that the judgment is not to be understood as a license to have extramarital relations.
""Decriminalizing adultery is not licensing adultery,"" Justice Chandrachud observed while hearing the case.

Many Asian countries uphold adultery as a crime. In the United States, adultery is still considered a crime in some states.

NEAR AL-BAB, Syria (Reuters) - Syrian rebels forced from their towns when government forces retook eastern Ghouta near Damascus are starting over in the far north, aiming to build hundreds of homes for displaced fighters and civilians on opposition-held land near the Turkish border.
Jaish al-Islam, one of Syria's most prominent rebel groups, likens the project to a new town for people from eastern Ghouta who have been living in camps since President Bashar al-Assad recaptured their area in April.
The project near the city of al-Bab points to preparations for a long stay in northern Syria, though Jaish al-Islam insists that the people displaced from eastern Ghouta will return. It is part of a wider effort by the group to recover in the north.
Jaish al-Islam commander Issam al-Buwaydani told Reuters in an interview that his group is reorganizing and rearming. Since arriving in the north, it is operating under the ""National Army"" umbrella - a Turkish-backed effort to unify numerous factions.
But civilian affairs are also a top priority: Buwaydani said a mall, a school, a mosque and a clinic would also be built at the construction site some 15 km (10 miles) from al-Bab.
""My entire combat group is working today in construction,"" said Abu Jaafar al-Khouli, 25, one of the Jaish al-Islam fighters working at the construction site.
""I took part in many battles in Ghouta against the regime and the Nusra Front. Now, I have returned to my original profession,"" added Khouli, a carpenter before Syria's civil war.
The site, where the goal is to build 1,400 homes, is part of an arc of territory in the northwest at that forms the last major opposition-held area in Syria.
The eastern Ghouta rebels defended their stronghold on the Damascus outskirts through years of government siege until earlier this year, when Assad took back the area in a ferocious Russian-backed offensive.
When it fell, thousands of people opted to take safe passage to the northwest rather than live under government rule, a pattern seen elsewhere that has left the northwest crammed with anti-Assad fighters and dissidents from all over Syria.
""WE WILL GO BACK""
Jaish al-Islam headed to the area north of Aleppo rather than Idlib province because of long-standing hostility toward the jihadist Nusra Front, also known as Tahrir al-Sham, which has a strong presence in Idlib.
The housing project is being built on land that officially belongs to the Syrian state. Permission was granted by the opposition-run council in al-Bab, Buwaydani said.
Financing is being provided by Ghouta merchants with no foreign funding, he said.
He noted that some displaced Syrians had been living under canvass for three or four years, adding: ""Our view is that living in tents has a negative impact on society."" 
The first phase of the project will lay foundations for homes. These will then be handed free of charge to Ghouta residents who will complete the construction with financial support from relatives outside Syria, he said.
But this does not signal any acceptance that they will not return to Ghouta. ""We will go back to our towns. We will liberate them and topple the terrorist tyrant,"" Buwaydani said, referring to Assad.
Buwaydani says his fighters are getting financial aid from Turkey in the form of salaries.
He said the group is ready for new battles against the Syrian government or other enemies, including the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia which controls much of northern Syria. Turkey views the YPG as a national security threat, and its intervention in northern Syria has been driven largely by this concern. 
Though Assad has crushed many areas of rebellion, Buwaydani still believes he can be toppled. ""It is not impossible that Assad falls, especially given that the opposition forces are gathered today in one place,"" he said.

""This is a source of strength.""

But Lieberman, on a visit to the Israeli-held side of the Quneitra crossing, said any resumption of operations at the facility depended on Syria.
""The fact that we have come here, to Alpha Gate, and as far as we are concerned UNDOF forces have begun to operate and patrol with the Israeli military's assistance, says that we are ready for the crossing to reopen,"" he told reporters, in comments distributed by his ministry.
Lieberman was referring to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, whose monitoring operations in a demilitarized zone established in 1974 between the Israeli-occupied Golan and the Syrian sector were disrupted by Syria's civil war.
""At the moment, the ball is in the Syrian court,"" Lieberman said.
Military police from Russia, a major ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, have been patrolling on the Syrian side of Quneitra, where Lieberman said Syrian police and customs officials were also present.
In the past, Lieberman said, traffic through Quneitra mainly comprised shipments into Syria of apples grown by Druze farmers on the Israeli-controlled Golan - and the entry of brides for partners on both sides of the armistice line.

Israel captured the Golan Heights in the 1967 Middle East war and fought Syria again on the strategic plateau in a 1973 conflict.

SANT JULIA DE RAMIS, Spain (Reuters) - Oriol Costa looks at a ballot box in a glass case in his village in Catalonia, a reminder of last year's banned Oct. 1 referendum on independence that plunged Spain into its worst political crisis in decades. 
An inscription under the case reads ""Never forget, never pardon"", a reference to the scenes of chaos that erupted across the region as riot police descended on polling stations to prevent the vote from going ahead.
""We never would have imagined such an extraordinary display of force,"" says Costa, who went with his 4-year-old son to vote in the village of Sant Julia de Ramis where police smashed the glass door of the polling station and seized voting materials.
Video footage shows Costa, carrying his son huddled on his shoulders, outside the polling station as police in riot gear drag people from the building.
Their use of batons and rubber bullets sparked an international outcry yet Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria praised the actions of the police on the day.
Madrid and the courts barred the referendum citing Spain's 1978 constitution, which states the country is indivisible.
Although both the Spanish prime minister and the leader of the Catalan government have been replaced, tensions remain.
Polls show Catalans favoring independence and those preferring to remain in Spain are more or less evenly split, both with less than a majority. 
New Catalan leader Quim Torra has urged Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to allow an agreed referendum but Sanchez has firmly ruled out any such vote or any unilateral attempt by Catalonia to secede from Spain.
Pro-independence feelings run high one year on in the village where the square outside a municipal sports center where the polling station was has been renamed ""October 1 Square"".

""People are upbeat, people are expectant,"" said Pere Pujolras, who is seen in video footage singing the Catalan anthem after police broke into the polling station. ""I have no doubt that we are on the right course.""

ZURICH (Reuters) - A Swiss minister who backs strong ties to the European Union announced on Thursday she planned to quit, the second to do so this week, amid efforts by the country to wrap up talks with the EU on renewing bilateral ties.
Switzerland and the EU, its biggest trade partner, have been negotiating a new treaty, but the talks have met opposition from both right-leaning parties fearful of a loss of sovereignty and from leftists who fear it could undermine protections for Swiss workers and companies.
Transportation and Energy Minister Doris Leuthard, from the center-right Christian Democratic People's Party and the longest serving minister in the current cabinet, said it was time to make way for ""new, fresh forces"" to join the government, without elaborating.
On Tuesday Swiss Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann, from the pro-business Liberal Democrats and also an advocate of robust ties with the EU, announced his resignation from the seven-member federal cabinet.
During a stint as Swiss president in 2017 Leuthard pushed for a normalization of ties with the EU that have been strained in recent years, including when Swiss voters in 2014 demanded quotas for EU citizens wanting to work in the country.
While defending Swiss interests, she maintained there was no alternative to good bilateral ties with the EU, which accounts for two-thirds of Switzerland's annual trade volume.
But in this push, Leuthard, a 55-year-old lawyer, faced setbacks. During her presidency, the EU baulked at recognizing Swiss stock exchange equivalency beyond the end of 2018, ratcheting up pressure on Switzerland to strike a new trade deal.
Under the compromise-minded Swiss system, the seven cabinet members take turns to serve as national president.
Discussion has begun over whether Leuthard and Schneider-Ammann and Leuthard should be succeeded by women to help balance the cabinet. With Leuthard, there are currently two women and five men. Replacements will likely be chosen in December.

OSLO (Reuters) - A Norwegian human rights foundation gave its annual prize on Thursday to Polish lawyer Adam Bodnar and the civil society group he heads for their work defending minority rights and judicial independence in Poland.
Changes to the judiciary made by Poland's nationalist government, such as lowering the retirement age of Supreme Court judges, triggered a lawsuit on Monday from the European Union over what the bloc believes to be a violation of the independence of courts in a member country.
Norway's Rafto Foundation said Adam Bodnar, 41, and the Office of the Commissioner for Human Rights in Poland were selected for ""the important stance taken in the face of current political developments in Poland"".
Four past Rafto laureates - Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi, East Timor's Jose Ramos-Horta, South Korea's Kim Dae-jung and Iran's Shirin Ebadi — later went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize. This year's Peace Prize will be announced on Oct. 5 in Oslo.
""Adam Bodnar has highlighted the crucial role played by independent ombudsman institutions in safeguarding human rights in Poland - and other countries - where such actors and institutions increasingly have come under attack,"" the foundation said in a statement.
Bodnar, in a statement issued through the foundation, said the prize showed recognition for Poland's civil institutions and human rights.
""The award is not just an award to my work and the institution, but mostly a support from your community given to the Polish civil society, academia, judges and lawyers fighting for rule of law, juridical independence, pluralism and protection of minorities in Poland,"" he said.

Bodnar as a civil servant cannot accept the $20,000 prize money so it will be donated to civic rights groups in Poland.

BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Slovak police have detained people suspected of the murder of investigative reporter Jan Kuciak and his fiancee, Slovak media outlets reported on Thursday, citing police sources.
The news was confirmed by a lawyer for the family of Kuciak, whose killing seven months ago rocked the central European country, stoking anger over public corruption and sparking the biggest street protests since the fall of communism in 1989.
""In the early morning hours today police detained suspects in the premeditated murder of Jan Kuciak and (his fiancee) Martina Kusnirova,"" lawyer Daniel Lipsic said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
He told Reuters by text message that he had been briefed by prosecutors. 
Lipsic later told the website of daily newspaper SME that he was convinced there was enough evidence to justify keeping the suspects in custody.
Local media reported that eight people were being held. Reuters could not immediately verify that number.
The police said earlier on its Facebook page it had detained persons suspected of a violent crime and was carrying out home searches but did not say in which case. A spokesman declined to comment further.
Media, including SME and Aktuality.sk, where Kuciak had worked, reported police were carrying out home searches in the south of the country.
Kuciak had, among other things, investigated fraud cases involving businessmen with Slovak political ties. He had also looked into suspected mafia links between Italy and businesses in Slovakia.
Kuciak was found shot dead along with Kusnirova at their home outside Bratislava in February. They were both 27.
In his final story, published posthumously, he reported on an Italian living in Slovakia with past business links to two Slovaks who later worked in then-prime minister Robert Fico's office.
Both of the Slovaks resigned but deny connections to the murder. Their Italian former business partner has also denied having connections with the mafia and the murder but was detained on a European drug trafficking warrant in March and extradited to Italy in May.
PROGRESS WELCOMED
Weeks of public protests in March eventually forced the departure of long-serving leader Fico and his interior minister Robert Kalinak, as well as police chief Tibor Gaspar.
However, Fico's three-party government coalition has remained in power under Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini, who comes from the ruling Smer party which Fico still leads.
Pellegrini welcomed news of the detentions in a social media post on Thursday. A spokeswoman said the prime minister had no official information on the police action.
""The investigation and punishment of those guilty of this murder is one of the priorities of my government,"" Pellegrini wrote.
The investigation is the biggest in the country's history. Interior Minister Denisa Sakova said on Thursday investigators had interviewed more than 200 people.
A prosecutor said in March the murder was likely to have been a contract killing related to Kuciak's work. Police released this month a sketch of a possible witness and said they had narrowed down possible motives to two.
While demonstrations are no longer being held regularly in the country of 5.4 million, organizers of the protests that numbered in the tens of thousands in March and April have vowed to keep up pressure on the government and to ensure a thorough investigation.

They said on Thursday that while they welcomed progress in the case, they would still hold an anti-government rally in Bratislava on Friday.

Iran and Russia have both backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in a seven-year war against rebels.
But Israel, increasingly concerned that its enemy Iran may establish a long-term military presence in its neighbor, says it has carried out more than 200 attacks against Iranian targets in Syria in the last two years.

The woman, sentenced under Islamic laws forbidding prostitution, will be the third to be caned in the conservative eastern state of Terengganu, ruled by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), following similar punishments in the past month. 
""Even though the offense does not involve a victim, it has a negative impact by destroying societal institutions, introducing sexually-transmitted diseases, and has a bad influence on the youth,"" said the prosecutor, Muhammad Khasmizan Abdullah. 
The 30-year-old single mother, who was caught by Islamic enforcement officers at a hotel on Sept. 17, had sought leniency, saying she turned to prostitution to raise her child and received no financial support from her former husband. 
The court ordered a jail term of six months and six strokes of the cane, however, said Muhammad Khasmizan, adding that the caning would be administered in prison within 14 days. 
The woman could not be reached for comment and she was not represented in court. 
Muslim-majority Malaysia operates a dual-track legal system, with Islamic criminal and family laws applicable to Muslims running alongside civil laws.
Women cannot be caned under civil laws but the punishment is allowed under Islamic laws in some states. 
On Sept. 3, two women were whipped six times each in front of dozens of people at a Terengganu sharia court for attempting to have lesbian sex, prompting an outcry from human rights groups, who described the punishment as torture.
A Muslim women's group, Sisters in Islam, said it was ""disappointed"" that the Terengganu court had again sentenced a woman to caning.
As a first-time offender, her personal hardship should have been taken into account, said Rozana Isa, executive director of the group.
""Today's case clearly demonstrates that the humiliation experienced by women before, during and after the whipping is not considered a relevant factor of their pain, when in fact humiliation is a key aspect of the punishment,"" she said in a statement.
But the humiliation caused lasting psychological trauma, she added.
The state had merely prosecuted crimes in which the offenders happened to be women, Muhammad Khasmizan said.
""Men are caned if they commit such crimes too, so the issue of gender does not arise.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - China demanded the United States ""dispel obstacles"" to improving military ties and stop slandering it, amid growing tensions over trade, Taiwan, the South China Sea and U.S. President Donald Trump's claims of China meddling in the upcoming U.S. election.
Trump on Wednesday accused China of seeking to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, saying that Beijing did not want him or his Republican Party to do well because of his pugnacious stance on trade.
The two countries are already embroiled in an acrimonious trade war and have continued to butt heads over a list of sensitive issues including the disputed South China Sea and self-ruled Taiwan, armed by Washington but claimed by Beijing. 
On Saturday, China summoned the U.S. ambassador in Beijing and postponed joint military talks to protest Washington's decision to sanction a Chinese military agency and its director for buying Russian fighter jets and a surface-to-air missile system.
Defence ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang told a monthly briefing that the United States should take steps to improve military relations and expressed China's firm opposition to ""provocative"" U.S. air force flights over the South China Sea, after U.S. B-52s flew in the vicinity of the waterway this week.
He even hinted a planned visit to the United States later this year for Defence Minister Wei Fenghe could be in doubt.
""The United States is to blame for the present problem, so the United States must immediately correct its mistakes, and withdraw the so-called sanctions to dispel obstacles that interfere in the healthy development of relations between the two militaries,"" Ren said, when asked about Wei's trip. 
Beijing has also denied a request for a U.S. warship to visit Hong Kong, the U.S. consulate in the Chinese city said on Tuesday. Ren said he had no further information on that.
Adding fuel to the flames, China was angered this week when the United States approved the sale of spare parts for F-16 fighter planes and other military aircraft worth up to $330 million to Taiwan, which China considers a wayward province. 
ELECTION INTERFERENCE
Speaking at a separate briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated a denial of Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to influence the U.S. congressional elections in November. 
""We advise the United States to stop this unceasing criticism and slander of China,"" Geng said.
""Stop these wrong words and deeds that damage bilateral relations and the basic interests of both countries' peoples.""
Trump also said on Twitter on Wednesday that China was ""placing propaganda ads"" in U.S. newspapers, referring to a Chinese government-run media company's four-page supplement in the Sunday Des Moines Register promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade.
Asked about the tweet, Geng said that such advertisements by foreign media were commonplace and allowed by U.S. law. 
""To say that this regular cooperation is China's government interfering in the U.S. elections is totally far-fetched and without foundation in facts,"" he said.
The military spat and election accusation have worsened a relationship already poisoned by the Sino-U.S. trade war.
China's commerce ministry said it was ""ridiculous"" for the United States to think that pressure could force concessions from China, sparked by Trump's blaming China for stealing U.S. intellectual property, limiting access to its own market and unfairly subsidizing state-owned companies.
""I want to stress that bullying and maximum pressure will not scare China and will not cause China's economy to collapse,"" ministry spokesman Gao Feng told reporters.

Gao was answering a question about comments by former White House strategist Steve Bannon, who last week told the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post that Trump planned to make the trade war ""unbearably painful"" for Beijing and would not back down.

JERUSALEM/CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi called for a resumption of Israel-Palestinian peace talks when he met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Sisi's office said on Thursday.
Netanyahu, writing on Twitter, said his talks with Sisi late on Wednesday focused on ""regional developments"". He did not elaborate.
At the meeting at his hotel in New York, Sisi ""stressed the importance of resuming the negotiations between the two sides, the Palestinians and the Israelis, to reach a just and a comprehensive solution based on a two-state solution and in accordance with the international treaties,"" according to a presidential statement.
Egypt has also been working to broker a long-term ceasefire between Israel and the Gaza Strip's dominant Hamas Islamist movement amid frequent violence along the Israel-Gaza border, where Palestinians have been holding weekly protests.
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have been suspended since 2014 and efforts to revive them have not been successful.
Netanyahu and Sisi convened for their previously announced talks several hours after U.S. President Donald Trump said he wanted a two-state solution to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in what had appeared to be the clearest expression yet of his administration's support for such an outcome.
But later on Wednesday Trump told a news conference he would be open to a one-state solution if that was the preference of the parties themselves, a position he had previously stated.
Netanyahu, a right-wing politician who rarely utters publicly the words ""Palestinian state"" - a concept he conditionally endorsed in 2009 but which far-right coalition partners oppose - said he was not taken by surprise by Trump's initial remarks.
In a statement, Netanyahu said he was confident a promised U.S. peace plan would back Israel's demand to maintain security control of the West Bank, territory it occupied in a 1967 war and which Palestinians seek as part of a future state.
Palestinians are boycotting Washington's peace efforts after Trump broke with long-standing U.S. policy by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moved the American Embassy to the contested city.
Palestinian leaders say that a state, with East Jerusalem as its capital, must be based on the pre-1967 war borders and see any future Israeli military presence as a violation of sovereignty.
Netanyahu and Sisi met in public for the first time in 2017. Israeli media reports last month said they had held a secret summit in Egypt in May to discuss a truce in neighboring Gaza, which is under tight Israeli and Egyptian border restrictions.
Egypt was the first of a handful of Arab countries to recognize Israel under a 1979 peace treaty and the two countries maintain close co-ordination on security as well as energy ties.

On Thursday Israeli and Egyptian companies announced that they would buy into a pipeline that would enable a landmark $15 billion natural gas export deal to begin next year.

460,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 05:33AM ET</span>","Catalonia crisis could flare again, with political and economic fall-out","MADRID (Reuters) - Monday will mark one year since a banned referendum in Catalonia on whether to separate from the rest of Spain.
At the height of the crisis over Catalonia's secession drive last year, thousands of companies moved their legal headquarters out of the region, the Madrid stock market and government bonds took a hit and the Spanish state came under strong pressure.
A year later, the organizers of an illegal referendum on independence for Catalonia are in jail or in self-imposed exile, Spain has a new prime minister and the economy has stabilized.
But the situation remains tense and could flare up any time.
WHAT IS THE DANGER FOR THE ECONOMY?
Despite the crisis, Catalonia remains one of Spain's main economic powerhouses and still accounts for around a fifth of national gross domestic product.
However, a Catalan trade group says hotels in Barcelona have seen revenue fall 14 percent this summer after the city developed a negative reputation internationally, partly as a result of political instability.
Data also showed fewer new businesses were created in Catalonia and international investment had dropped, putting the region on track to fall behind Madrid in terms of economic output for the first time.
More than 3,000 firms have shifted their headquarters outside the region, many to Madrid. The risk is that the uncertainty over investments in Catalonia will translate into a slow economic decline.
WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON POLITICS?
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who ousted the conservative Mariano Rajoy in June, remains opposed to Catalonia becoming an independent state, something the Spanish constitution does not allow.
Sanchez has however adopted a softer tone and offered to hold a wide-ranging dialogue that could lead to drafting a new statute of autonomy that Catalans would have the opportunity to adopt or reject by referendum.
Catalonia's new leader, Quim Torra, earlier this month dismissed the idea that this could be a way forward and instead called on Sanchez to accept a legally-binding referendum on independence.
Because Sanchez needs Torra's party votes in the national parliament to pass the annual budget bill, a failure to find common ground in Catalonia would likely spill over to national politics in Madrid - and possibly trigger a snap national election sometimes in early 2019.
WILL THE ISSUE GO AWAY?
According to a survey released in July 46.7 percent of Catalans want their region to become an independent state, while 44.9 percent oppose this solution.
The number of people who are in favor or against independence has remained roughly stable over the last four years, meaning the issue is unlikely to go away any time soon.

Catalonia also elected a new regional parliament this year in which separatist forces retained a majority of seats. The trials of jailed separatist leaders should keep the Catalan question at the top of the political agenda for the time being.

The Indian-born brothers - Ajay, Atul and Rajesh - have been accused of using their ties with Zuma to siphon off billions of rand in state funds and of inappropriately influencing cabinet appointments.
The Guptas are believed to be in Dubai where they own property and businesses and police have issued an arrest warrant for Ajay Gupta over a corruption case.
The Guptas and Zuma, who have repeatedly denied wrongdoing, could not be reached for comment.
Justice Minister Michael Masutha told Reuters that treaties on extradition and legal assistance had been signed with his counterpart Sultan Saeed Al Badi on Tuesday in Abu Dhabi. 
""I will not at this stage comment on individual matters,"" Masutha said when asked about the Guptas.
A long-awaited inquiry into allegations of inappropriately influencing government decisions, known locally as ""state capture"", opened last month with witnesses testifying that the Gupta brothers tried to bribe or threaten them.
The Guptas left South Africa earlier this year around the time Zuma resigned under pressure from his own party.
Activists, opposition politicians and members of the ruling African National Congress have been calling for an extradition treaty to be agreed with the UAE so the Gupta brothers can be ordered to return to South Africa.
""This means the infamous Guptas are fast running out of places to hide as they can now face extradition to finally answer for state capture,"" said Natasha Mazzone, Democratic Alliance shadow minister on state companies.

Jonathan Jahan, 25, didn't cross the road in the end. But a temporary work agency contacted him with an offer to be a coach driver and Jahan, who studied horticulture and had been looking for months for a job in the gardening sector, accepted.
""I'm happy because I'm going to work in something I love,"" he told BFM TV, which reported he had turned down 20 other proposals.
The publicity generated by his chat with Macron, during an open day at the Elysee Palace on Sept. 15, worked wonders for the job-seeker if not the president, whose approval rating has fallen below 30 percent, the worst since his election.
The footage triggered frenzied reactions online and in the media about the president's blunt talk and whether he was right to point out a mismatch between a French unemployment rate of 9 percent and thousands of unfilled vacancies.
""If you're keen and motivated, in the hotel trade, cafes, restaurants, construction even — there's nowhere I go that people don't tell me they're looking to hire,"" the 40-year-old president told Jahan, speaking frankly but not unkindly.
""Honestly. Hotels, cafes, restaurants — if I cross the road I can find you something. They simply want people who are ready to work.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) - A love for running marathons and playing basketball is already making Sandiaga Uno, the Indonesian opposition's contender for VP in next year's presidential race, a hit both offline and on social media.
The 49-year-old private equity executive, running mate to retired military general Prabowo Subianto, plans to use this popularity to tackle issues weighing on Southeast Asia's biggest economy, including a plunging currency and ""unnecessary"" government spending. 
The pair are up against the popular incumbent Joko Widodo in the race to lead the world's third-largest democracy. Both sides are pushing a nationalistic economic agenda, but issues of religion and ethnicity are expected to feature prominently in the six-month campaign. 
Dressed in a breezy stub-collared, pale blue shirt, khaki pants, with thick-rimmed glasses and sandals, Uno cuts a starkly different image from Widodo's running mate - a septuagenarian conservative Muslim cleric - and one that has proved popular with young voters and female voters. 
""Millennials are flaky and we have a tough task in convincing them,"" he said in an interview at his campaign headquarters in a leafy residential neighborhood in central Jakarta. 
""We need to bring relevant issues that are attractive enough for millennials so they show up to vote.""
The opposition has zeroed in on a 9 percent plunge in the rupiah this year to highlight what Uno called an ""absence of strong government"". 
""We are going into turbulent economic times... We need strong leaders with a firm grip on issues like jobs and prices,"" Uno said.
""We need to send the right signals to the domestic scene and the outside world that Indonesia is taking control of its own economy.""
Opinion polls give Widodo a double-digit lead over Prabowo, but some show the gap narrowing.
Criticizing a cornerstone of Widodo's term, which has seen a building boom of roads, airports, railways and a dramatic slashing of red tape, Uno said Prabowo would roll out ""deep structural reforms"" with spending cuts, tax reform, and giving the private sector a bigger share of infrastructure development. 
""What we need is smaller...stronger government,"" he said.
He added that he and Prabowo would prioritize job creation, investment and export industries if voted into office. 
Prabowo and Uno hail from elite military and business circles respectively, but neither has an extended track record in elected office, save Uno's past 10 months as deputy governor of Jakarta. 
Uno won that position after a controversial race that opened up deep religious and ethnic divisions in the world's largest Muslim-majority country. His team, which was backed by Prabowo, was seen as riding a wave of mass Islamist protests that brought down Jakarta's then governor, an ethnic Chinese Christian. 
Both Prabowo and Uno maintain links with hardline Islamist groups, some of whom have been known to intimidate minorities.
Rights activists have raised concerns about a recent rise of hardline Islamism that they say threatens Indonesia's long-standing reputation for pluralism and tolerance for minority religions and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. But LGBT rights are unlikely to feature prominently in the campaign. 
Uno said his side would maintain a focus on economic issues and was unlikely to be influenced by conservative Islamic groups.

""We have big data to show people are tired of divisive campaigns,"" he said. ""We think people will vote based on economic issues... We don't want to take our eyes off the ball.""

At least two rockets landed within 300 meters (yards) of the governor's compound, where Ghani was meeting local officials, while a third struck further off, said Ahmad Khan Sirat, spokesman for Ghazni police.
There was no word on any casualties but light and heavy weapons fire could be heard, he said.
Ghazni, on the main highway between the capital Kabul and southern Afghanistan, still bears the scars of days of heavy combat last month when hundreds of Taliban fighters stormed the city and overran large parts of the center.
The attackers were eventually driven off with heavy losses by Afghan forces backed by U.S. air strikes but the assault caused shock across Afghanistan, underlining the insurgents' ability to mount large scale attacks on major cities.

Ghani's visit to Ghazni, accompanied by his wife, was aimed at assessing the security situation in the city.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - A Guatemala City court ruled on Wednesday that the crime of genocide had been perpetrated during the darkest hours of the country's long civil war, but acquitted a former military intelligence chief of the killings.
The verdict was the latest development in a stop-start search for justice by victims since the conflict ended in 1996.
Retired general Jose Mauricio Rodriguez, 73, was on trial for his alleged role in a counterinsurgency plan that killed at least 1,771 members of the Indigenous Ixil Mayans and displaced thousands more during former dictator Efrain Rios Montt's 1982-1983 rule.
""This court unanimously resolved that the crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity are proven (to have happened) and acquitted the defendant Jose Mauricio Rodriguez Sanchez of both crimes,"" said the court.
Two of three judges on the panel voted to absolve Rodriguez.
""There is no evidence that shows that the accused had knowledge of what was happening in the conflict areas ... the accused could not issue orders due to the rank and position he held in the army,"" said judge Delmer Gonzalez.
The sole dissenting judge, Sara Yoc Yol, said: ""he should have been sentenced because he handed over all that information and as far as I'm concerned he is guilty of genocide.""
An estimated 200,000, mostly Maya civilians were killed, and a further 45,000 went missing during the Cold War-era conflict that lasted from 1960 until 1996.
""I ask you give me my freedom. There isn't a piece of evidence that I ordered the killings,"" Rodriguez said Wednesday morning, in his last statement prior to the court giving its verdict.
Lawyers for the victims and their families said that testimonies from survivors had proven that acts of human rights violations and sexual assault were committed in Guatemala.
Family members of the Ixil Mayans and human rights groups laid out flowers, photos of those killed and candles as they waited for the verdict.
During the trial, the judges heard the testimony of 69 people and reviewed more than 600 documents.
Former dictator Rios Montt, diagnosed with senile dementia in 2015, was facing a new genocide trial overseen by a Supreme Court tribunal that was ongoing at the time of his death in April this year.

In May 2013, a court found Rios Montt guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity. But just 10 days afterwards, the country's top court quashed the conviction on a technicality after persistent efforts by his defense team to derail the trial with complex appeals.

467,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2018 02:33AM ET</span>",Brazil's evangelicals say far-right presidential candidate is answer to their prayers,"By Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - On a visit to Israel two years ago, far-right Brazilian lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro leaned back into the River Jordan in a white robe to be baptized in the arms of a fellow congressman and evangelical pastor.
While still an avowed Catholic, Bolsonaro is riding a wave of support from Brazil's evangelical Christians, who have helped make him the presidential front-runner heading into the first round of voting slated for Oct. 7.
Evangelicals account for one of every four voters in the world's largest Catholic country and more than 20 percent of its federal lawmakers. Many have been captivated by Bolsonaro's eager embrace of the culture wars and his strident anti-gay rhetoric. In a 2011 interview with Playboy Brazil, for example, the father of five said he would not be able to love a gay son. ""I would rather that my son died,"" he said.
These voters now want the former Army captain to lead a conservative counter-attack against the progressive agenda of the leftist Workers Party (PT), which led Brazil for most of the past 15 years.
These supporters view Bolsonaro's election as critical to ending recognition by Brazil's courts of same-sex civil unions and to stopping momentum towards gay marriage.
They also want to halt legislative efforts to legalize abortion, drugs, gambling and stem-cell research. And they aim to block any attempts to penalize discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Above all, they want to see education on LGBT rights removed from public schools.
""The left went too far,"" said Bishop Robson Rodovalho, founder of the Brasilia-based Sara Nossa Terra church, which has 1.6 million followers. ""Indoctrinating school children on sex revolted many parents. Today we are seeing a boiling over of reaction.""
Like many other evangelical leaders, he is calling on his followers to back Bolsonaro, whose middle name is Messias, Portuguese for ""Messiah"". 
Bolsonaro's campaign managers say those votes will be decisive in securing victory. They have met with religious leaders throughout the country to hear their vision for Brazil. Bolsonaro regularly attends prayer sessions held by evangelical pastors in their congressional offices in Brasilia. And the thrice-married candidate accompanies his evangelical wife to church on Sundays, aides said.
Evangelical volunteers have responded by distributing campaign flyers outside churches and talking up Bolsonaro to friends and neighbors. Such grassroots organizing is critical to Bolsonaro's low-budget campaign; he has no major political party behind him and very little ad time on radio and television.
Still, he draws nearly five times the support from evangelical voters as does environmentalist Marina Silva, the only evangelical politician among major candidates. Recent surveys by Brazilian polling firms Ibope and Datafolha said 36 percent of evangelical voters will cast their ballot for Bolsonaro next month, and only 7 percent or 8 percent for Silva.
Bolsonaro's popularity grew further after he was stabbed in the abdomen by a mentally disturbed assailant at a campaign rally earlier this month. The candidate was forced to stop campaigning while he recovers.
Support for the front-runner has since leveled off at 28 percent in a crowded field of 13 contenders. If no candidate wins a majority on Oct. 7, as is predicted, the top two vote-getters will square off in a second round of voting on Oct. 28.
The fiery Bolsonaro has the highest rejection rate of all candidates, which could be a handicap in a run-off. 
Polls currently predict his likely challenger will be PT candidate Fernando Haddad, the former mayor of Sao Paulo. He replaced jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on the ticket when Lula was barred from running due to a corruption conviction. An Ibope poll on Wednesday showed Haddad defeating Bolsonaro by a 6-point margin in a head-to-head race.
SEX IN SCHOOL
Many of Bolsonaro's evangelical supporters are united in their fear that the family, the main institution of a Christian society, is under threat from a godless state.
These voters chafed when Lula's government set up a national program to promote LGBT rights. But evangelicals were particularly incensed when the administration of Lula's hand-picked successor, Dilma Rousseff, attempted to distribute a manual instructing educators on how to teach children tolerance of gay and lesbian relationships. Opposition to the material, which critics dubbed the ""Gay Kit"" was so fierce that the initiative was dropped. 
Pastor Everaldo Pereira, the politician who baptized Bolsonaro in the River Jordan, said parents, not the state, should teach their children about sex and traditional marriage between a man and a woman.
Pereira, the leader of the Social Christian Party, is now running for the Senate. He wants to push through a law reversing a 2011 Supreme Court decision that allowed same-sex civil unions. He says putting Bolsonaro in the nation's top job could help that dream come true.
""Bolsonaro will restore order to the chaos,"" Pereira said. 
The faithful, meanwhile, have turned away from one of their own. Support for Silva, the former senator who won about 20 percent of the votes cast in the two previous presidential elections, has plummeted mainly among evangelical voters. 
Silva has long advocated keeping her evangelical faith separate from politics. That is a position many believers interpret as unwillingness to defend their values.
Bolsonaro, for example, has vowed to veto any legislation seeking to legalize abortion, which is allowed only in cases of rape, fetal deformation and to save a mother's life. Silva favors a plebiscite to let Brazilians decide.
""That's Marina. Let's save the turtle eggs but kill fetuses,"" said unemployed teacher Madalena Venancio, 44, at a Bolsonaro rally. ""I prefer his frankness.""
LAW AND ORDER 
Bolsonaro has cast himself as an anti-establishment figure in the mold of U.S. President Donald Trump, whose policies he admires. 
But despite nearly 27 years in Congress he has few legislative achievements to show for it. Instead, his career has consisted largely of courting controversy. He has repeatedly expressed support for the nation's 1964-1985 military dictatorship, and made headlines with racist, sexist and homophobic comments.
Reviled by many critics as a backbench blowhard, Bolsonaro displayed shrewd political instincts by tapping into public anger over rampant corruption and rising crime. He wants to loosen gun laws so more Brazilians can arm themselves. And he favors giving police carte blanche to kill suspected criminals. 
That get-tough stance has won admirers in a nation that saw a record of nearly 64,000 murders last year.
Leaving an evangelical church service recently in Ceilandia, a working class suburb of Brasilia, Maria de Conceiçao said she was leaning toward voting for Bolsonaro.

""He says he will restore discipline in schools, where students do what they want and hit their teachers,"" Conceiçao said. ""Maybe we should try a military officer now.""

ABOARD THE KAGA, Indian Ocean (Reuters) - Japan's biggest warship, the Kaga helicopter carrier, joined naval drills with Britain's HMS Argyll in the Indian Ocean on Wednesday as the frigate headed toward the contested South China Sea and East Asia.
Britain, Japan and their close ally the United States have found common cause in countering growing Chinese influence in the region that they worry could put key commercial sea lanes linking Asia with Europe, the United States and elsewhere under Beijing's sway. 
""We have traditional ties with the British navy and we are both close U.S. allies and these drills are an opportunity for us to strengthen cooperation,"" Kenji Sakaguchi, the Maritime Self Defence Force (MSDF) commander of the Kaga group's four helicopters said on the hangar deck. 
The more frequent presence of the Royal Navy in a region is a chance for the two navies to train more closely in the future, he added.
The Argyll, Kaga and its destroyer escort the Inazuma practiced formations on calm seas in the Indian Ocean close to commercial sea lanes plied by container vessels and oil tankers. Three helicopters from the Japanese carrier hovered above, monitoring the drill. 
The Argyll's arrival in the region comes after Britain's amphibious assault ship HMS Albion, last month challenged Beijing's territorial claims in the South China Sea on its way to Vietnam from Japan by sailing close to Chinese bases in the Paracel islands in a freedom of navigation operation (FONOP).
China dispatched a warship and helicopters to counter the British presence and warned London that similar actions in the future could endanger talks for a possible trade deal that Britain is seeking as it prepares to leave the European Union.
    
GLOBAL HOTSPOT
China, which says its intentions are peaceful, claims most of the South China, through which some $3 trillion of seaborne trade passes every year. Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei also claim parts of the sea, which has oil and gas deposits as well as rich fishing grounds. 
Japan, which is embroiled in separate territorial dispute with China in the neighboring East China Sea, has yet to conduct a FONOP in the south China Sea. 
However, in a rare public announcement this month, Japan's Ministry of Defence said one of its submarines had carried out a naval exercise in the disputed waterway with two Japanese destroyers and the Kaga, which is on a two-month deployment in the Indo-Pacific.   
After crossing the South China Sea, the Argyll will operate in waters around Japan, including a stint monitoring sanctions imposed on North Korea by the United Nations to force it to abandon nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, said a British government source, who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to talk to the media.
The Argyll is the third Royal Navy ship in Asia's waters this year following the tour of the Albion and another frigate.

""Normally we hold discussion with other countries before joint drills, but with the British there is no need to, so they are easy to work with,"" said Tatsuhiko Mizuno, an operation planning officer for the Kaga group.

Javier Duarte, who governed the Gulf coast state of Veracruz for outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) until 2016, pleaded guilty to the charges in federal court, according to Mexican media.
The court also fined Duarte 58,890 Mexican pesos ($3,123) and seized 40 properties.
Prosecutors argued that Duarte headed an organization whose criminal operations were carried out in Veracruz, the eastern Gulf state of Campeche and Mexico City between 2011 and 2016.
Lawlessness in Veracruz spiked under Duarte, with top Mexican auditor ASF saying in 2016 that the irregularities in public funds under his rule were the highest amount it had ever seen.
Duarte's case became emblematic of government failure to root out corruption and undermined support for the PRI, which has been Mexico's dominant party for most of the past century.
Elected governor in 2010, he is alleged to have acquired luxury properties in Mexico and abroad, defrauding taxpayers of sums some estimates put in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and using shell companies to transfer and hide public funds.
Duarte was arrested in Guatemala in April 2017 after more than five months on the run and was extradited to Mexico three months later.

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday upheld a Louisiana provision that requires doctors who perform abortions in the state to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.
In a 2-1 ruling from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, the judges said the Louisiana provision was different than one in Texas that was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016 because it would not put an undue burden on women.
""There is no evidence that any of the clinics will close as a result of the Act,"" the appeals court said in its ruling.
The Texas law, whose language is similar to the Louisiana law, led to the closure of the majority of the state's abortion clinics and the number of women forced to drive over 150 miles to seek abortions increased by 350 percent, the appeals court said. 
The plaintiffs in the Louisiana suit, which included abortion provider Hope Medical Group for Women, were not immediately available for comment. The defendant, the secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, was also not available for comment.
Abortion has been a central issue in the U.S. Senate confirmation process for President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Abortion rights advocates worry that Kavanaugh, whose judicial record on abortion cases is thin, could change the balance on the court in favor of more restrictions, or even help overturn the court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion.
Some states are passing restrictive abortion laws, which they expect could be challenged in court but hope might ultimately win favor from a conservative Supreme Court.
DISSENT OVER UNDUE BURDEN TEST
The admitting privileges act in Louisiana has the same language as the one in Texas, which requires abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles (50 km) of their clinic. Supporters say the provision helps protect women by providing continuity of care.
Medical groups and abortion providers contend the requirement is unnecessary because complications from abortions are rare, and when they do occur, emergency room medical staff are well equipped to provide care.
They also said the provision is designed to shutter clinics, which is what happened in Texas.
In Texas, before the state's 2013 law went into effect, there were about 40 licensed abortion facilities in the state, which has a population of about 27 million. After it went into effect, that number dropped to eight, the appeals court said. 
The two judges who upheld the provision, both appointed by Republican presidents, ruled that the Louisiana law, ""does not impose a substantial burden on a large fraction of women."" They said that only 30 percent of women seeking an abortion would face a potential burden of increased wait times.
In his dissent, Judge Patrick Higginbotham, also a Republican appointee, said the panel failed to meaningfully apply the undue burden test as articulated by the Supreme Court.
In a 5-3 decision written by Justice Stephen Breyer in 2016, the Supreme Court concluded the Texas law violated a woman's right to an abortion and did not offer medical benefits sufficient to justify its existence.

TAIPEI - Taiwan said on Thursday its relationship with the Vatican is stable, although it will closely watch what it described as ""suppression"" by China following a landmark deal between Beijing and the Vatican on the appointment of bishops on the mainland. 
The Vatican has signed an agreement giving it a long-desired say in the appointment of bishops in China, triggering worries among some officials in Taiwan that the Vatican could switch diplomatic recognition to Beijing. 
The Holy See is Taiwan's last remaining diplomatic ally in Europe. The self-ruled island of Taiwan has formal relations with 16 other countries, many of them small, less developed nations in Central America and the Pacific. 
Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a renegade province, has routinely accused China of using dollar diplomacy and bullying to lure away its allies, charges Beijing has denied. 
""We will closely watch the suppression and calculations from China,"" Taiwan Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Andrew Lee told reporters on Thursday in response to comments from Beijing that it wanted to deepen ties with the Vatican.
""The Taiwan-Vatican relations are stable,"" he said, adding that Taiwan would actively assist with a plan by the Vatican to remodel its embassy in Taipei, using that as an example of the stable ties. 
Critics have labeled the Vatican accord with China as a sellout to the Communist government, with Cardinal Jospeh Zen, the most senior Catholic cleric on Chinese soil, describing it as ""an incredible betrayal"".
""They're giving the flock into the mouths of the wolves,"" 86-year-old Zen told Reuters last week.
Since the deal was signed on Saturday, the Vatican has not mentioned Taiwan. 

On Wednesday, Pope Francis urged China's leaders to move ahead with ""trust, courage and farsightedness"" and called on Chinese Catholics to not shrink from offering ""a word of criticism"" when necessary to defend human dignity.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The chairman of Australia's public broadcaster resigned on Thursday after allegations he appeared to bow to government pressure when he called for the removal of a senior journalist.
Justin Milne, chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), said he would resign after widespread anger from staff, labor unions and lawmakers.
""My aim, has been to look after the interests of the corporation. It's clearly not a good thing for everyone to be trying to do their job with this kind of firestorm going on so I wanted to provide a release valve,"" Milne told the ABC.
Milne's departure comes just days after the ABC sacked former managing director Michelle Guthrie. The ABC said Guthrie was dismissed amid concerns about her leadership style.
The ABC is funded by the government but is an independent body.
But leaked emails from Milne appeared to suggest funding could be jeopardized if the ABC did not remove a senior journalist who had angered the government through her coverage of its corporate tax policy.
""We are tarred with her brush. I think it's simple. Get rid of her,"" Milne allegedly wrote in the email published by The Sydney Morning Herald on Thursday.
Australia's conservative government has traditionally been at logger heads with the ABC, which it perceives as being left wing, with the relationship souring further this year following a funding cut.
Facing widespread anger, Australia's government said it would conduct an internal investigation.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison denied his predecessor Malcolm Turnbull sought to influence the ABC.
""If they make mistakes and it's alright for people to call them out on that,"" Morrison told reporters in Beerwah, 75 kms (46.6 miles) north of the Queensland's state capital Brisbane.
""But the idea that the government has somehow got some list and is telling the ABC who should work there and who shouldn't. That's complete rubbish.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is close to working with Saudi Arabia on building nuclear power reactors, but talks on tough non-proliferation standards with the kingdom remain a challenge, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on Wednesday.
Perry has held talks with several Saudi leaders this year, including King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, on the kingdom's ambition of initially building two nuclear power stations. Saudi Arabia wants to ultimately construct 16 reactors in coming decades at a cost of about $80 billion.
Discussions had been held up on Saudi Arabia's desire to relax nonproliferation standards and potentially allow the country to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium, technologies that non-proliferation advocates worry could one day be covertly altered to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons.
Perry said progress on non-proliferation standards had been made, but that talks were not going as quickly as either side would have hoped. Perry has shared with Saudi leaders that being ""perceived as very, very strong on non-proliferation was a most important message, globally,"" he told reporters at the Energy Department headquarters.
Perry said part of the talks center on making sure any nuclear inspections would not be intrusive for sensitive areas in the kingdom. 
In July, South Korea said its state-run utility KEPCO along with the United States, France, China and Russia had been shortlisted to bid for a nuclear power project in Saudi Arabia and that the winner would likely be selected in 2019.
Washington hopes Saudi Arabia will buy nuclear power technology from U.S. companies, including Westinghouse, which recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy and abandoned plans to build two advanced AP1000 reactors in the United States.
If Saudi Arabia signs a deal that relaxes the safeguards, the United Arab Emirates could be free to break a deal it signed with Washington years ago and enrich uranium. The UAE deal contained the ""gold standard"" in such 123 nuclear agreements, because it contained safeguards against enriching and preprocessing.

Westinghouse said it would defer to the customer, Saudi Arabia, for comment. The Saudi embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Zhao Zewei was sentenced to death in July after being charged with homicide for attacking 19 students near a middle school in Mizhi county in China's northwestern province of Shaanxi on April 27.
After receiving approval from China's supreme court, the death sentence was carried out in Mizhi county of Shaanxi on Thursday, according to the statement from the Yulin City Intermediate Court.
Zhao had said he had taken knives into his former school in order to vent frustration and anger over his misfortunes in life and the bullying he was subjected to while attending the school, the statement said. 
But the motives for depriving others of life were ""despicable"" and the methods were especially cruel, and so the supreme court agreed to the use of the death penalty, it cited the supreme court as ruling.
Violent crime is rarer in China than many other countries, due in part to strict gun controls and tight security in major cities. Recent years have seen a series of knife and axe attacks, however, including one this year in Beijing. 
China does not release official figures for the number of people it executes every year, but rights groups estimate that more people are executed annually in the country than in all other countries combined.

475,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 10:15PM ET</span>",From chatroom to courtroom: China's #MeToo movement takes legal turn,"By Christian Shepherd, Joyce Zhou and Philip Wen
BEIJING (Reuters) - When a former intern at China's state broadcaster wrote in July about being groped and forcibly kissed by one of the country's most recognizable television stars, her story ignited a social media firestorm in a country where a backlash against sexual harassment was growing.
Now her case is set to go before the Chinese legal system.
The 25-year-old former intern told Reuters she had been informed Tuesday by a court in Beijing's Haidian district that she was being sued in a civil case for damaging Zhu Jun's reputation and mental wellbeing. 
Also named in the suit was Xu Chao, a friend who had been championing the case online. At her request, Reuters is withholding the name of the accuser and identifying her by her online name, Xianzi.
Zhu is demanding that the two women apologize online and in a national newspaper, pay compensation of 655,000 yuan ($95,254.72) and cover the costs of legal fees for the case, according to a copy of the filing seen by Reuters. 
Descriptions of Zhu forcibly kissing and groping Xianzi were ""pure fiction"" and had caused ""grave damage"" to Zhu's public image and his mental health, according to the filing, which was dated Sept. 18 and is not available to the public.
In response, Xianzi applied to file her own civil suit against Zhu on Tuesday for ""infringement of personality rights"", she told Reuters. Personality rights is a broad term used within Chinese law to refer to personal dignity rights, but does not specifically mention sexual harassment.
""I decided that you have to use the law to prove what you said happened,"" Xianzi said on Wednesday.
Zhu, 54, whose lawyers have publicly denied the allegations, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Zhu's lawyer issued a statement earlier this month saying he had sued the two women. Reached by telephone, Xu confirmed the filing of the lawsuit.
China's justice and public security ministries did not respond to requests for comment.
China does not have a law that specifically prohibits sexual harassment. However, on Aug. 27 China's parliament announced that it was considering adding provisions to a civil code, expected to be passed in 2020, that would allow a victim to file a civil suit against someone who uses words, actions or exploits a subordinate relationship to sexually harass them.
The changes would also require employers to take measures to prevent, stop and handle complaints about sexual harassment.
VAGUE LAWS, CULTURE OF SILENCE
In recent months, women have made several allegations of sexual abuse against powerful men, including prominent university professors, the head of China's Buddhist association, and leading figures in the media and at non-governmental organizations, which have reverberated across social media in China.
That intensified with the arrest and release by U.S. police last month of Richard Liu, chief executive of Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com, on a rape allegation. Liu has not been charged and through a lawyer has denied any wrongdoing.
Up to now, vague laws, patchy implementation and a lack of understanding among lawyers, judges, police and the public have hampered attempts to handle cases through the courts, and deterred many victims from filing suits, according to activist groups.
The lack of a clear definition of sexual harassment, or an agreed upon standard for addressing complaints, entrenches a ""culture of silence"", according to the Beijing Yuanzhong Gender Development Center, a non-profit.
The group said that while workplace sexual harassment is widespread in China, only 34 specific cases have been logged in the official court case database since 2010.
HOUSEHOLD NAME
Xianzi was a 21-year-old intern at the state broadcaster CCTV when she said she met Zhu, who is famous across China for hosting an annual spring festival extravaganza, one of China’s top-rated programs.
In an interview with Reuters, Xianzi said that she had been alone in a dressing room with Zhu when he asked her if she wanted to work for the channel after her internship, before trying to take her hand on the pretext of reading her fortune. 
Despite her protests, Xianzi said, Zhu groped her under her skirt before pulling her head and forcibly kissing her, only stopping when interrupted by knocking on the door.
CCTV did not respond to requests for comment.
Xianzi said she was moved to act after reading accounts of sexual assault and harassment posted on Chinese social media by women emboldened by the country's fledgling #MeToo movement.
In July, Xianzi, now a screenwriter, wrote about her own experience on WeChat, sharing it with a small circle of friends. When Xu, her friend, shared the post on the Weibo platform, it went viral.
On Tuesday, Xianzi returned to social media.
""Still a bit angry, this is Xianzi, hello everyone, I'm getting ready for a fight,"" she wrote on Weibo.

476,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 09:00PM ET</span>",Syrian rebels see jihadists leaving Idlib demilitarized zone,"By Suleiman Al-Khalidi
AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian mainstream rebel groups said on Thursday they have growing confidence that their jihadist rivals will comply with a requirement to leave a demilitarized buffer zone set up by Turkey and Russia under a deal that averted a Russian-backed Syrian army offensive.
Earlier this month, Turkey and Russia reached an agreement to enforce a new demilitarized zone in Syria’s Idlib region from which “radical” rebels will be required to withdraw by the middle of next month.
A senior Syrian opposition official said the most powerful jihadist group in the Northwest, Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by al Qaeda's former Syrian offshoot, had sent secret feelers to the Turkish army though third parties in the last few days signaling they would comply.
""Matters are moving well and Tahrir al Sham has pledged it is going to implement but without announcing its agreement,"" said the opposition official, who was briefed by Turkish officials and requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The demilitarized zone agreed by Turkey and Russia will be 15 to 20 km (10 to 12 miles) deep and run along the contact line between rebel and government fighters. It will be patrolled by Turkish and Russian forces.
The Russian-Turkish agreement hinges on the response of jihadist fighters and could unravel quickly if Moscow and Ankara cannot jointly impose their plan on the Islamist groups.
Another senior opposition figure said he expected Tahrir al Sham group to implement the deal and dismissed risks of a showdown because the agreement did not seek to force the jihadist fighters to hand over their weapons. 
""I foresee it will be implemented within the time set,"" said Ahmed Toma, a prominent opposition figure who headed the Syrian rebel delegation in Russian-sponsored talks in the Kazakh capital.
Tahrir al Sham has yet to declare its stance on the deal, and its position will be critical to its success. 
Turkey had thrown its full weight with Russia to avert a major campaign by the Syrian Army to recapture Idlib that the U.N. warned would bring a humanitarian catastrophe. Ankara pledged to Moscow it would handle the jihadist threat.
A regional intelligence source said the jihadists were softening their stance to avoid deadly internecine fighting with mainstream rebels that could wreck the deal and allow the Syrian army and its Russian ally to resume their stalled offensive.
""I don't expect any hurdles in implementation from all the revolutionary forces at all,"" said Abdul Salam Abdul Razzak, a leading figure in the National Front for Liberation, the alliance of Turkey-allied Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebel groups.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview with Reuters late on Tuesday that the withdrawal of “radical groups” had already started. 
Several rebel sources said none of the groups, either jihadist or mainstream rebels, had started to pull back. 
The National Front for Liberation, which had declared its ""complete cooperation"" with the Turkish effort, said it foresaw a smooth operation once logistical preparations with Turkey were concluded.
""Pulling heavy arms from the frontline is not a difficult matter as most of these weapons are deployed away from the frontline,"" Abdul Razzak said, adding the group's only concern was whether the Syrian army and its allies would abide by the deal.

UNITED NATIONS/CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro headed for New York on Wednesday to attend the United Nations General Assembly and U.S. President Donald Trump said he would be open to meeting the socialist leader of the crisis-stricken South American nation.
Venezuela's government had not previously said whether Maduro would attend the U.N. meeting. Maduro said last week he might not attend, adding ""they have me in their sights to kill me"" without specifying who might target him.
The White House said no meeting was planned between the two leaders, and Venezuela's information ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Trump's comments earlier on Wednesday suggested he could meet Maduro, who has been publicly seeking a sit-down with Trump, his ideological foe, since last year.
""I would certainly be open to it, I'm willing to meet with anybody,"" Trump said as he arrived at the United Nations headquarters. ""We're going to take care of Venezuela, if he's here and he wants to meet, it was not on my mind, it was not on my plate, but if I can help people that's what I'm here for.""
He said that ""all options"" were available to find a solution to Venezuela's ballooning economic and political crisis, which has fueled an exodus to nearby Latin American countries.
""All options are on the table, every one,"" Trump told reporters. ""The strong ones and the less than strong ones - and you know what I mean by strong. Every option is on the table with respect to Venezuela.""
The White House last year said a meeting with Maduro would happen when Venezuela returned to democracy.
A group of Latin American countries and Canada said earlier on Wednesday they had asked the International Criminal Court to investigate Maduro's government over allegations of crimes against humanity in its use of force to repress political opponents. 
Maduro was due to speak at the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations later on Wednesday.
""I am landing in New York to defend the truth of Venezuela, to bring the voice of our fatherland,"" said Maduro in a video posted on Twitter showing him and his wife Cilia Flores - whom the United States sanctioned on Tuesday - in the presidential plane. He did not mention Trump in the video. 
Maduro frequently accuses the United States of seeking to sabotage his administration by fomenting an economic crisis and stoking unrest. 

The Trump administration and many Latin American government, however, blame Venezuela's economic meltdown on reckless money printing, dysfunctional currency controls and poor management by Maduro's administration. Inflation is running at 200,000 percent and basic foods and medicines, like rice and antibiotics, are increasingly difficult to obtain.

BERLIN (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan, on the eve of a visit to Germany, urged it to designate as a terrorist organization the Fethullah Gulen movement, which Turkey blames for a 2016 coup attempt.
Germany has previously rejected this request, saying it needs more proof linking the network of supporters of the U.S.-based cleric, which Turkey labels the Gulenist Terrorist Organisation (FETO), to the failed attempt to overthrow the Turkish government.
""Our primary expectation from the federal republic (of Germany) is that it recognize FETO as responsible for the attempted putsch, just as Britain did,"" Erdogan wrote on Wednesday on the website of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.
Relations between Ankara and Berlin have been badly strained by a crackdown in Turkey after the failed coup in which dozens of Germans were imprisoned.
""We are pursuing the goal of increasing our trade and economic ties,"" Erdogan wrote. ""For the sake of prosperity and the future of both our countries, let us increase our mutual interests and reduce our problems.""
After years of breakneck growth, Turkey is in crisis, its heavy foreign debt load increased by the Turkish lira's 40 percent slide this year - a sell-off that intensified after President Donald Trump imposed sanctions in retaliation for the detention of a U.S. pastor.
Germany is home to three million people of Turkish ethnic background. Ankara is angry with Berlin for giving asylum to alleged coup plotters, while German authorities fret over Erdogan's influence over Germany's Turks.
Officials have warned Erdogan against campaigning overtly when he opens a mosque on Saturday in Cologne, home to one of Germany's largest Turkish communities.
Germany and the European Union rely on Turkey to stem the flow of Syrian war refugees to prevent a repeat of events of 2015, when a million migrants arrived in Germany, convulsing European politics and weakening Merkel.
""He needs money, and he hopes to get it from Germany,"" said former Greens leader Cem Ozdemir, a critic of Erdogan who, as Germany's most prominent politician of Turkish background, is regularly demonized in Turkish pro-government media.
""We should use that to speak up for the many people rotting in Turkish prisons just for disagreeing with Erdogan,"" he added in an interview with public broadcaster SWR.
The expected announcement in Nyon, Switzerland, on Thursday of which of the two soccer-mad nations gets to host the 2024 UEFA championships will be the least of diplomats' concerns.
Erdogan plans meetings with Merkel on each of the three days of the visit, but both countries' officials have said financial aid for the crisis-hit economy is not on the agenda. Berlin deflects concerns about granting Erdogan a state visit by insisting human rights will be high on the agenda.
Many senior politicians, including Merkel, are staying away from the banquet President Frank-Walter Steinmeier is giving in his honor on Friday. But Ozdemir will be there, hoping to send a message.

""Erdogan has to face the fact that opposition is part of politics in Germany, and not thrown into prison or silenced like in Turkey,"" he told Die Welt in an interview.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday called on world leaders in New York to reject nationalism and fight to preserve the multilateral system, challenging U.S. President Donald Trump's anti-globalism stance.
May used her address at the United Nations General Assembly, chaired by Trump, to warn that ""aggressive nationalism"" could replace the rules-based international order unless leaders revived public confidence in the current system.
""If we lack the confidence to step up, others will,"" she said, citing examples from the last century like the rise of fascism or the spread of communism. She said such trends were resurfacing in Europe and beyond.
""We have seen what happens when the natural patriotism which is a cornerstone of a healthy society is warped into aggressive nationalism, exploiting fear and uncertainty to promote identity politics at home and belligerent confrontation abroad, while breaking rules and undermining institutions.""
On Tuesday, Trump used his annual address to the United Nations to lay down a defiant message that he will reject globalism and protect American interests: ""America is governed by Americans. We reject the ideology of globalism, and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism.""
May's officials said the speech was not aimed at Trump and had been largely written before she had seen his remarks. The two were due to hold bilateral talks before May flies back to London.
Nevertheless, her response zeroed in on Trump's comments. 
""We must learn the lessons of the past and show through our actions how cooperation between strong and accountable states with open economies and inclusive societies can best deliver security and prosperity for all our people,"" she said.
May also expressed her support for a free and fair media - another position which puts her at odds with Trump, who has frequently criticized journalists and described news reports that contradict his opinion or policy positions as fake news.

""Like many leaders, I suspect, I do not always enjoy reading what the media in my country writes about me,"" May said. ""But I will defend their right to say it – for the independence of our media is one of my country’s greatest achievements, and it is the bedrock of our democracy.""

Corbyn said on Wednesday Labour would vote against a Brexit deal based on Theresa May's proposals, the strongest warning yet to a prime minister whose plan to leave the European Union is hanging by a thread.
May has said the EU needs to show Britain respect and come up with their own alternatives to her so-called ""Chequers"" proposals, which EU leaders rejected at a summit in Austria last week.
""With just weeks of negotiating time left, it's clear that UK-EU Brexit talks are in a perilous state. Time is running out and companies are losing patience with the absence of any clarity from the government,"" Corbyn said in a statement ahead of the meeting with Barnier, adding he would set out how his party would break the current impasse in talks.
""Crashing out of Europe with no deal risks being a national disaster. That is why I'm meeting EU officials today, and I will be urging them to do all they can to avoid a ""no-deal"" outcome, which would be so damaging to jobs and living standards in both the UK and EU countries.""
Corbyn has previously met with Barnier to discuss Brexit, and once brought him an Arsenal football shirt as a gift.

May has said that Labour's meetings with EU officials are undermining her efforts to negotiate a Brexit deal.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he did not have a time frame for North Korea to denuclearize just as his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, plans to visit Pyongyang again next month to set up a second summit for Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
""I think we're really going to do something that's going to be very important, but we're not playing the time game,"" Trump told reporters in New York, responding to a question at a news conference. ""If it takes two years, three years or five months - doesn't matter.""
Trump's comments came after Pompeo had a meeting with North Korea's foreign minister, which the U.S. secretary of state described as very positive. Pompeo will visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
He wrote on Twitter that his meeting with Ri Yong Ho on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York was to discuss the summit and ""next steps toward denuclearization of #NorthKorea.""
""Much work remains, but we will continue to move forward,"" Pompeo said.
His visit to Pyongyang next month will be his fourth this year.
Referring to North Korea by the acronym of its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the State Department said the aim of the meeting would be ""further progress on the implementation of the commitments from the U.S.-DPRK Singapore summit, including the final, fully verified denuclearization of the DPRK, and to prepare for a second summit ...""
Trump held an unprecedented first summit with Kim in Singapore on June 12 that yielded a broad pledge by Kim to ""work toward"" denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
Kim’s commitments and actions, however, have fallen short of Washington’s demands for a complete inventory of North Korea’s weapons programs and irreversible steps to give up a nuclear arsenal that potentially threatens the United States.
Trump said earlier on Wednesday the United States and North Korea had ""a wonderful relationship going"" and he would announce the timing and location of his next meeting with Kim in the ""very near future.""
Pompeo told ""CBS This Morning"" earlier that U.S. officials were working ""to make sure we get the conditions right"" for a second summit. He said any future summit could happen in October, but more likely after that.
Trump's remarks on North Korea this year have been dramatically different from those in his speech last year at the U.N. assembly, when he threatened to ""totally destroy"" the country and mocked Kim as ""Rocket Man"" on a ""suicide mission"".
SANCTIONS 
In his address to the General Assembly on Tuesday, Trump praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still had to be done and sanctions must remain in place on North Korea until it denuclearizes. 
On Wednesday, Trump told the U.N. Security Council that many positive things were happening behind the scenes on North Korea, ""away from the media.""
""So I think you will have some very good news coming from North Korea in the coming months and years.""
Trump said Kim had reaffirmed his commitment to complete denuclearization to him directly in a ""very strong letter form.""
""I think we will make a deal,"" he said.
""But, unfortunately, to ensure this progress continues, we must enforce existing U.N. Security Council resolutions until denuclearization occurs,"" Trump said, while complaining that some nations were violating U.N. sanctions.
During a subsequent meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a folded piece of paper that he said was an ""extraordinary letter"" from Kim and said North Korea had ""a great future.""
""If you go back a year, if you go back certainly to the time I took office, it looked like we were going to war with North Korea. It doesn't look like that any more. It looks like just the opposite. So we're very happy about that,"" Trump said.
Asked by CBS if Kim had agreed to allow international inspectors into nuclear sites, Pompeo said, ""Yes,"" while adding that verification was important in any nuclear agreement.
""We've talked about this verification from the beginning,"" he said. ""We're not going to buy a pig in a poke. We're going to get this right. We're going to deliver on this commitment (to denuclearize) that Chairman Kim has made to the world.""
Pompeo said after his last visit to Pyongyang in July that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours to denounce him for making ""gangster-like demands.""

North Korea had made international inspection of its main nuclear site conditional on ""corresponding measures.""

482,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 06:57PM ET</span>",Trump accuses China of 2018 election meddling; Beijing rejects charge,"By Yara Bayoumy and Michelle Nichols
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused China of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, saying Beijing did not want his Republican Party to do well because of his pugnacious stance on trade.
""China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election, coming up in November. Against my administration,"" Trump told a U.N. Security Council meeting whose ostensible subject was nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Chairing the Council for the first time, Trump made no reference to suspected Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and provided no evidence for his allegation about China, which Beijing immediately rejected during the same meeting.
""We did not and will not interfere in any country's domestic affairs. We refuse to accept any unwarranted accusations against China,"" the Chinese government's top diplomat Wang Yi told the Council.
The United States and China are embroiled in a trade war, sparked by Trump's accusations that China has long sought to steal U.S. intellectual property, limit access to its own market and unfairly subsidize state-owned companies.
Later on Wednesday, Trump referred to a Chinese government-run media company's four-page supplement in the Sunday Des Moines Register promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade. The practice of foreign governments buying space in U.S. newspapers to promote trade is common and differs from a clandestine operation run by a national intelligence agency.
""China is actually placing propaganda ads in the Des Moines Register and other papers, made to look like news,"" Trump said in a Twitter post.
In a Des Moines Register article about the advertising supplement, Carol Hunter, executive editor of the newspaper, said the placement was not surprising.
""It’s not surprising that China Daily sought to place advertising with the Des Moines Register, because the Register is Iowa’s largest news organization and Iowa farmers are disproportionately affected by China’s tariffs,"" Hunter said.
A senior Trump administration official said China uses political, economic, commercial, military and information tools to influence U.S. public opinion and promote the interests of the Chinese government and Communist Party.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence plans to make a speech next week detailing the allegations, said the official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, saying the U.S. government was working to declassify further information on the matter.
During an evening news conference, Trump described Chinese President Xi Jinping as a friend, prompting a reporter to ask how that could be the case given the allegations of meddling.
""Maybe he's not any more, I'll be honest with you,"" Trump replied. 
IRAN: U.S. 'ABUSED' COUNCIL SESSION
Trump also used the Security Council session to defend the U.S. withdrawal in May from a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran, hint at progress in U.S. efforts to curb North Korea's nuclear program, and to criticize Iran and Russia for supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the country's war, now in its eighth year.
""The Syrian regime's butchery is enabled by Russia and Iran,"" Trump said.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded in a Twitter post, saying the United States had ""abused"" the Council and is ""further isolated.""
Trump's allegation of Chinese election meddling came as a surprise during a formal meeting around the Security Council's horseshoe table that was expected to concentrate on the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
""They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade and we are winning on trade, we are winning at every level. We don't want them to meddle or interfere in our upcoming election,"" said Trump, who is attending the U.N.'s annual gathering of world leaders.
Trump himself is not up for re-election until 2020 but November's voting will decide whether his Republican Party can keep control of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate. Some opinion polls show that the Democratic Party could make a strong showing, notably in the House.
In the latest salvo in the trade dispute, U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods and retaliatory taxes by Beijing on $60 billion worth of U.S. products kicked in on Monday, unnerving global financial markets.
During his roughly 10-minute speech, Trump made no reference to U.S. allegations against Russia concerning the election that brought him to power.
Speaking later to reporters, Trump said: ""They (China) are trying to meddle in our elections. And we’re not going to let that happen, just as we’re not going to let that happen with Russia.""

Trump's presidency has been dogged by the Russian issue, which led to an investigation by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller into potential collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign, which Trump rejects. Moscow denies interfering.

483,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 06:46PM ET</span>",Trump says he wants two-state solution for Mideast conflict,"By Steve Holland
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he wanted a two-state solution to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the clearest expression yet of his administration's support for such an outcome.
The Trump administration has in the past said it would support a two-state solution if both sides agreed to it.
Trump, in a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the United Nations General Assembly, also said he wanted to unveil a peace plan in the next two to three months.
""I like a two-state solution. That's what I think works best ... That’s my feeling,"" said Trump.
Netanyahu has said any future Palestinian state must be demilitarized and must recognize Israel as the state of the Jewish people - conditions that Palestinians say show he is not sincere about peacemaking.
The United States' Arab allies are strong proponents of a two-state solution.
At a news conference in New York later on Wednesday, Trump said he would be open to a one-state solution if that was the preference of the parties themselves, a position he has previously stated.
""If the Israelis and the Palestinians want one state, that's OK with me. If they want two states, that's OK with me,"" he said. ""I'm happy if they're happy.""
Doubts have mounted over whether Trump’s administration can secure what he has called the “ultimate deal” since December, when the U.S. president recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and then moved the U.S. Embassy there.
Trump said ""it is a dream of mine"" to secure an agreement before the end of his term in office, which ends in early 2021.
""I don't want to do it in my second term. We'll do other things in my second term,"" he said. ""I think a lot of progress has been made.""
Netanyahu said after meeting Trump he was ""not surprised"" at the U.S. president's preference for a two-state solution for peace with the Palestinians, Israeli media reports said.
Jerusalem is one of the major issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Both sides claim it as a capital. Trump’s move outraged the Palestinians, who have since boycotted Washington’s peace efforts, led by Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner.
The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem. Israel captured those territories in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally. It regards all of the city as its eternal and indivisible capital.
Nabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said: ""The two-state solution means to us that we have a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. This is the only way to achieve peace.""
Rdainah said the Palestinians wanted to resolve all the core issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - which include borders, settlements, refugees, security and the status of Jerusalem - ""according to United Nations resolutions.""
Rdainah, speaking in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, refused to be drawn further, saying Abbas would make the Palestinian position clear in his speech to the General Assembly on Thursday.

Asked what Israel might have to give up in return for the embassy's move to Jerusalem, Trump replied: ""I took probably the biggest chip off the table. And so obviously we have to make a fair deal, we have to do something. Deals have to be good for both parties ... Israel got the first chip and it's a big one.""

Cabinet ministers including Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, foreign minister Jeremy Hunt, environment secretary Michael Gove and interior minister Sajid Javid are looking to prevent May from locking Britain into a no-deal Brexit, the report said.
The opposing ministers want May to consider a Canada-style free trade deal if the European Union rejects May's proposals again at a summit on Oct. 18, giving her a Plan B to avoid the deal, the Times said. 

The concerns arose after May said she would prefer a 'no-deal' Brexit to the offer currently put forward by the European Union, stressing that Britain needs to see counter-proposals from the EU to move Brexit negotiations forward.

485,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",U.S. pressure could work only if Iran deal survives: France,"By John Irish and Parisa Hafezi
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - France's president said on Wednesday that the United States' sanctions policy on Iran could force Tehran to negotiate, but only if European powers are able to ensure it sticks to a 2015 nuclear deal that is preventing hard-liners from taking control. 
U.S. President Donald Trump used a session on nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction at the U.N. Security Council to defend his May 8 decision to abandon the nuclear pact under which Tehran limited its nuclear program in return for the easing of U.S., European and international economic sanctions.
The core U.S. sanctions that seek to choke off Iran's oil exports, the lifeblood of its economy, will resume in early November, and Trump promised that ""after that the United States will pursue additional sanctions, tougher than ever before, to counter the entire range of Iran's malign behavior.""
In contrast, his closest European allies, France, Britain and Germany, along with China and Russia, are trying to salvage the accord by developing ways to bypass U.S. sanctions so that Iran can still receive oil revenue, giving it an incentive to stay in the agreement.
""Perhaps because we're able to keep this multilateral framework (nuclear deal), avoid the worst and act as a mediator, while the U.S. sanctions create pressure and reduce the amount of money available for Iran's expansionism, that can accelerate the process we want,"" French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters. 
""As long as the deal serves our interests, we will remain in the pact,"" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told reporters in New York. ""Remaining members of the deal have taken very good steps forward, but Iran has higher expectations."" 
The European powers and the United States agree that a broader deal needs to be struck with Iran that tackles its long-term nuclear activities, ballistic missile program and to curb its regional influence. They accuse Iran of supporting destabilizing proxies in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iraq.
However, Macron warned that unlike North Korea, Iran was not ruled by one dictator and diehard elements were determined to kill the nuclear deal.
""The main risk of the pressure strategy is that it pushes Iran to restart its nuclear activities ... so if we want a chance for this pressure on Iran to produce results, then we need to make sure it doesn't opt for the worst option.""
Trump asked the Security Council to work with Washington to ""ensure the Iranian regime changes its behavior and never acquires a nuclear bomb."" 
But highlighting the differences in approach, the European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said a so-called Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) under consideration to facilitate trade with Iran could be in place ""before November.""
The SPV, slammed by U.S. officials, would create a sort of barter system, similar to one used by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, to exchange Iranian oil for European goods without money changing hands and avoiding banking exchanges.
Whether that is enough to keep Iran on board remains to be seen. Facing a collapsing economy at home, Rouhani is in a bind and is being pressed by hard-liners to abandon the deal as its economic benefits evaporate.

Big European companies have already pulled out and Iranian oil exports have fallen sharply even before Nov. 4 when the next round of sanctions come into effect.

486,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 04:15PM ET</span>",Salisbury poisoning suspect named as a Russian colonel by UK media,"LONDON (Reuters) - The real identity of one of the men wanted by Britain for the Salisbury nerve agent attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter is Anatoliy Vladimirovich Chepiga, according to media reports on Wednesday which said he was a decorated Russian colonel.
Earlier this month, British prosecutors charged two Russians - Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - with attempted murder for the Novichok poisoning of the Skripals in the southern English city in March but said they believed the suspects had been using aliases to enter Britain.
The Daily Telegraph and the BBC said Boshirov's real name was Chepiga, citing investigative reporting by Bellingcat, a website which covers intelligence matters. Two European security sources familiar with the Skripal investigation said the details were accurate.
Russia denies any involvement in the poisoning, and the two men have said they were merely tourists who had flown to London for fun and visited Salisbury to see its cathedral. 
The British government knows both their real identities, sources close to the investigation have said.
The Telegraph reported that Chepiga, 39, had served in wars in Chechnya and Ukraine, and was made a Hero of the Russian Federation by decree of President Vladimir Putin in 2014.
The Metropolitan Police, who are investigating the poisoning, and the Foreign Office declined to comment on the report. But British defense minister Gavin Williamson appeared to confirm its veracity on Twitter.
""The true identity of one of the Salisbury suspects has been revealed to be a Russian Colonel. I want to thank all the people who are working so tirelessly on this case,"" Williamson said in a tweet, which was later deleted without explanation.
Prime Minister Theresa May did not address the reports directly in a speech to the United Nations in New York, but spoke of ""the reckless use of chemical weapons on the streets of Britain by agents of the Russian GRU (military intelligence)"".
The Russian Embassy in London was not immediately available to comment. The Kremlin has previously said that the suspects have nothing to do with Putin.

487,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",Court orders Polish PM to correct election rally comments,"WARSAW (Reuters) - A court on Wednesday ordered Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki to correct within 48 hours comments he made comparing his government's record with its predecessor's, during a crucial election campaign.
The court of appellation ordered Morawiecki to broadcast a statement before the evening news on two major TV stations admitting he was factually wrong in claims about his administration's road infrastructure program.
The state news agency PAP quoted the judge as saying that Morawiecki had to admit that a statement he made to a Sept. 15 election rally was wrong.
The prime minister had told the rally: ""We are spending more money in a period of 1-1.5 years on local roads than was spent by the PO-PSL coalition in eight years.""
The opposition centrist Civic Platform (PO) had brought a lawsuit against him over the statement, made at a gathering of his ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party ahead of October local elections.
Morawiecki's lawyer said he disagreed with the court ruling but it ""will be most probably followed"".
The opposition immediately called on the prime minister to resign.
""I want to say very seriously today: this is a discredit and shame, a man of honor would resign in such a situation,"" the head of PO, Grzegorz Schetyna, was quoted by PAP as saying.
The election race is neck-in-neck.
""This is an important moment of this campaign, but it is hard to say if it is a turning point,"" said Anna Materska-Sosnowska, political scientist at Warsaw University.
""PM Morawiecki wants to appeal to centrist and undecided voters, but in such a situation it may be difficult. The PiS electorate will probably ignore this (ruling).""
The PiS, in power since 2015, is at odds with Brussels which accuses it of violating European Union values by its moves to reform the judiciary and control state media.
Observers say results of the local elections will be an indicator of what could happen in elections to the European Parliament and Poland's general election next year.

Support for PiS in opinion polls is around 40 percent, but some researchers say the opposition could match the euroskeptic party's support if united in one anti-PiS bloc.

488,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>",Cosby's appeal likely to focus on parade of accusers at his second trial,"By Joseph Ax
(Reuters) - Bill Cosby's appeal of his conviction for sexual assault is expected to focus on a Pennsylvania judge's decision to allow several accusers to testify against him, but his challenge faces significant hurdles, according to legal experts.
The disgraced comedian's first trial hinged largely on the credibility of a single woman, his one-time friend Andrea Constand, who said he drugged and sexually assaulted her in 2004, and ended in a hung jury.
At his second trial in April, Montgomery County Judge Steven O'Neill allowed the jury to hear five other women with strikingly similar stories of sexual abuse. Cosby was found guilty and on Tuesday was sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.
Cosby's lawyers face a difficult burden in convincing an appellate court to second-guess O'Neill's decision, experts told Reuters.
""I don't think that they have any significant likelihood of winning this appeal,"" said Michelle Dempsey, a law professor at Villanova University in Philadelphia. ""The evidence was solid, and the standard in Pennsylvania is clear.""
Other potential appeals grounds include the decade-plus gap between the crime and Cosby's arrest, claims of bias against the trial judge and an alleged promise by a former district attorney not to prosecute Cosby for the Constand incident. 
Cosby, once known as ""America's Dad"" for his role as the beloved patriarch of the Huxtable family on the 1980s television comedy ""The Cosby Show,"" has been accused by more than 50 women of sexual abuse dating back decades. Only Constand's allegations were recent enough to lead to criminal prosecution.
He was given a minimum of three years in prison on Tuesday and immediately taken in handcuffs to the county jail. His lawyers are expected to ask an appellate court to free him on bail while his appeal is pending.
A lawyer and a spokesman for Cosby did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.
CHALLENGING OTHER ACCUSERS
Typically, testimony about ""prior bad acts"" is barred from trial, under the theory that jurors may end up convicting the defendant for misconduct unrelated to the crime in question. But many states, including Pennsylvania, permit such witnesses if they are called to show a specific pattern of behavior.
In Cosby's case, virtually all of his accusers have described a similar modus operandi. He offered some form of mentorship before plying them with drugs or alcohol in a place he controlled, such as a hotel room or his own home, to facilitate sexual assault.
At Cosby's first trial, prosecutors sought to call more than a dozen other accusers, but O'Neill limited them to just one: Kelly Johnson, who said Cosby drugged and assaulted her in 1996.
Ahead of the second trial, however, O'Neill gave prosecutors permission to call five women as witnesses. He did not offer his legal reasoning, but under Pennsylvania law, he will be required to do so in writing if Cosby's lawyers raise the issue on appeal.
In between the two trials, the #MeToo movement, the national reckoning with sexual misconduct by powerful men, was born following allegations against the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.
Wesley Oliver, director of the criminal justice program at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, said the defense would likely question why O'Neill changed his mind.
""If the judge found one to be the appropriate number the first time around, how do you explain five the second time around?"" he said in an interview after Cosby's conviction in April. ""The law didn't change between these two cases; society changed a lot. If you're the appellate court, what do you do with that?""
The legal standard to reverse O'Neill's decision is whether he abused his discretion, a high bar to clear, according to experts.
Nevertheless, appellate courts tend to look closely at prior bad act witnesses because the potential for prejudice against the defendant is also high, said Dennis McAndrews, a former Pennsylvania prosecutor.
Cosby's lawyers are also likely to renew their argument that former Montgomery County District Attorney Bruce Castor promised Cosby in 2005 he would not be prosecuted if he agreed to sit for a deposition in Constand's civil case against him.
The deposition, in which Cosby acknowledged giving sedatives to young women, was unsealed a decade later, and prosecutors cited it as a crucial piece of evidence when they brought criminal charges.
Even so, legal experts said the lack of a written deal with Castor, as well as the fact that Cosby had his own lawyers at the time, would make it hard for Cosby to argue that he had an ironclad agreement.
In the meantime, his family and aides are pressing his case in the court of public opinion.

Cosby was the subject of ""the most racist and sexist trial in the history of the United States,"" his publicist, Andrew Wyatt, told reporters just minutes after he was led out of the courthouse in shackles on Tuesday.

The 58-year-old's first trip to the United Nations and the United States has also marked his debut on the world stage since taking office from his mentor Raul Castro, 87, in April. Castro and his late brother Fidel Castro had run the country for nearly 60 years.
""The generational change in our government should not deceive the enemies of the revolution,"" Diaz-Canel said. ""We are continuity, not rupture.""
He made it clear the message was intended in particular for the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, which has tightened the decades-old U.S. trade embargo on the Caribbean island nation over the last year-and-a-half.
""Despite the blockade ... and the actions carried out by the United States to impose a regime change, the Cuban revolution is here, alive and vigorous, faithful to its principles"", he said.
Just a day before at the General Assembly, Trump lambasted ""socialism’s thirst for power (that) leads to expansion, incursion, and oppression"" and said Cuba was sponsoring the ""socialist Maduro regime"" in Venezuela.
Diaz-Canel, meanwhile joined other world leaders in decrying Trump's unilateralism. However, he said Cuba remained open to dialogue as long as it was in a position of equals.
""The use of threat and force, unilateralism, pressures, reprisals and sanctions characterize ever more frequently the behavior and rhetoric of the U.S. government,"" he said.
Earlier in the week, Diaz-Canel held bilateral meetings for the first time as president with leftist allies like Salvadoran President Salvador Sanchez Ceren as well as right-wing leaders like Argentine President Mauricio Macri.
He has also met with representatives of U.S. technology companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) that are keen to explore investment opportunities in Cuba and U.S. lawmakers like Republican Congresswoman Kathy Castor who believe better relations between the old Cold War foes are in the interest of both countries.
The announcement on Wednesday of the creation of the first U.S.-Cuban biotech joint venture to bring Cuban-developed cancer treatments to U.S. patients underscored their point.

""Today’s announcement is an unmistakable example of the good that can come from U.S.-Cuba engagement,"" the Center for Democracy in the Americas said. ""Our two countries stand to gain immeasurably from closer ties, be it in the field of biotech, education, sports, commerce, or the arts.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military flew B-52 bombers in the vicinity of the South China Sea this week, U.S. officials told Reuters, a move that is likely to cause anger in Beijing amid heightened tensions between the two countries. 
Lieutenant Colonel Dave Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, said that B-52 bombers transited over the South China Sea as part of ""regularly scheduled operations designed to enhance our interoperability with our partners and allies in the region.""
Such flights are common, but usually upset Beijing. In June, China's foreign ministry said no military ship or aircraft could scare China away from its resolve to protect its territory after U.S. B-52 bombers flew near disputed islands in the South China Sea.
The United States and China have frequently sparred about the militarization of the South China Sea, where China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines all have competing claims.
""If that was 20 years ago and (China) had not militarized those features there, it would have just been another bomber on its way to Diego Garcia or whatever,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters.
Eastburn said separately the United States also flew B-52 bombers over the East China Sea on Tuesday as part of a ""regularly scheduled, combined operation.""
China recently denied a request for a U.S. warship to visit Hong Kong amid rising tension between Beijing and Washington.
China summoned the U.S. ambassador in Beijing and postponed joint military talks in protest against a U.S. decision to sanction a Chinese military agency and its director for buying Russian fighter jets and a surface-to-air missile system.
Mattis said he did not think there was a fundamental shift in relations between China and the United States.
""We certainly maintain the military-to-military relationship and the level of participation and collaboration may go up and down at times, but there is a strategic relationship there that I think both sides recognize the need for,"" Mattis said.
The United States and China are embroiled in a trade war, sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's accusations that China has long sought to steal U.S. intellectual property, limit access to its own market and unfairly subsidize state-owned companies.

Trump accused China of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections on Wednesday, saying Beijing did not want his Republican Party to do well because of his pugnacious stance on trade.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said on Wednesday a so-called Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) under consideration to facilitate trade with Iran could be in place ""before November.""
The SPV aims to keep trade flowing even if possible U.S. sanctions hit Tehran. Asked at an event in New York when it could be established, Mogherini said: ""I believe before November.""
Asked if the United States' pulling out of the Iran deal could be a serious challenge to the U.S. dollar as reserve currency in the context of the creation of the SPV, Mogherini said “it is still an initial stage, but this could be a result of that. For sure, it has made us and other parts of the world wonder what kind of (financial) autonomy we have.”
Even as she said she continues to consider the United States the EU's strongest ally, Mogherini said ""no sovereign country or organization can accept that somebody else decides with whom you are allowed to do trade with.""

European diplomats have previously described the SPV proposal as a means to create a barter system, similar to one used by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, to exchange Iranian oil for European goods without money changing hands.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A third woman on Wednesday accused Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's U.S. Supreme Court nominee, of sexual misconduct in the 1980s, further inflaming an already contentious Senate confirmation process. Kavanaugh immediately denied the allegation.
The woman, Julie Swetnick, detailed her allegation in a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee a day before the Republican-led panel is set to hold a high-stakes hearing in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused him of a sexual assault in 1982, will testify.
""This is ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone,"" Kavanaugh said in a statement released by the White House. ""I don't know who this is and this never happened.""
Swetnick is represented by lawyer Michael Avenatti, who also represents adult film star Stormy Daniels in a lawsuit against Trump to void a non-disclosure agreement under which the president's former personal lawyer paid her $130,000 not to discuss her alleged relationship with Trump more than a decade ago.
Speaking to reporters in New York, where he is attending the annual U.N. gathering of world leaders, Trump said of the new allegation, ""I think it's ridiculous."" On Twitter, Trump called Avenatti ""a total low-life"" and ""a third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations."" Avenatti responded on Twitter, calling Trump ""a habitual liar and complete narcissist."" 
In her statement, Swetnick said she attended more than 10 house parties in the Washington area from 1981 to 1983 where Kavanaugh was present. She described gang rapes she said occurred in which boys would line up to rape incapacitated girls.
""In approximately 1982, I became the victim of one of these 'gang' or 'train' rapes where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present,"" she said, mentioning the name of a close friend of Kavanaugh. She did not identify her attackers and did not accuse Kavanaugh of taking part.
""During the incident, I was incapacitated without my consent and unable to fight off the boys raping me. I believe I was drugged using Quaaludes (a sedative) or something similar placed in what I was drinking,"" she said.
She also said she witnessed efforts by Kavanaugh and others ""to cause girls to become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be 'gang raped' in a side room or a bedroom by a 'train' of numerous boys,"" adding she remembers boys including Kavanaugh getting in lines to take part in these rapes.
She did not identify the individuals directly involved in those assaults.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify her accusations. Swetnick and Avenatti did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An attorney for Judge said he denied Swetnick's allegation.
In an interview with Fox News on Monday, Kavanaugh was asked whether he ever participated in or was aware of any gang rape at a party he attended. ""That's totally false and outrageous. I've never done any such thing, known about any such thing,"" Kavanaugh responded.
Supreme Court appointments must be confirmed by the Senate, and Trump's fellow Republicans control the chamber by a narrow 51-49 margin, meaning Republican defections could sink his nomination. The controversy has unfolded ahead of the Nov. 6 congressional elections in which Democrats seek to take control from the Republicans.
Trump chose Kavanaugh, a conservative federal appeals court judge, for a lifetime job on the top U.S. court in July after the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy. Kavanaugh's confirmation would cement conservative control of the Supreme Court, as Trump moves to shift the high court and the broader federal judiciary to the right.
A committee vote on his confirmation is due on Friday, with a final Senate vote as early as Tuesday.
Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University in California, has said Kavanaugh attacked her and tried to remove her clothing when both were high school students in Maryland while he was drunk at a party when he was 17 years old and she was 15. Another woman, Deborah Ramirez, has accused him of exposing himself during a drunken dormitory party during the 1983-84 academic year when both attended Yale University.
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.
'A TRAVESTY'
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and all the Judiciary Committee's Democrats called on Kavanaugh to withdraw in light of the allegations, and said if he does not, an FBI investigation is needed before any Senate confirmation vote. 
""If our Republican colleagues proceed without an investigation, it would be a travesty for the honor of the Supreme Court and our country,"" Schumer said in a statement.
Another Democratic Senator, Jeff Merkley, filed a lawsuit seeking to delay the confirmation process.
Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, the committee's chairman, said the hearing will go forward as planned and that the panel's staff is looking into the Swetnick's allegation.
Lawyers for Ford, who has accused Kavanaugh of a sexual assault in 1982, released signed documents from Ford's husband, Russell Ford, and three friends, seeking to offer corroboration for her account.
Russell Ford said his wife shared her story during a couples therapy session in 2012 and friends Keith Koegler, Adela Gildo-Mazzon and Rebecca White said Ford told them separately of the incident between 2013 and 2017.
In testimony released ahead of Thursday's hearing, Kavanaugh denied all the allegations against him but said he was ""not perfect"" during his high school days.
""I drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends. Sometimes I had too many. In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now,"" he added.
Trump on Wednesday faulted Republicans for not pushing the nomination through the Senate, which must confirmation Supreme Court appointments, more quickly.
The latest developments in the pitched battle over Kavanaugh's confirmation added to the perception of Washington as paralyzed by partisan rancor and legislative dysfunction.
Senator Jeff Flake, a moderate Republican, issued a plea for civility.
""We sometimes seem intent on stripping people of their humanity so that we might more easily disregard or defame them and put them through the grinder that our politics requires. We seem, sometimes, to even enjoy that,"" Flake said of the Washington culture.

The abduction and suspected massacre of the students, who were studying at a teachers' training college in Ayotzinapa in the southwestern state of Guerrero, precipitated one of the worst crises of President Enrique Pena Nieto's tenure.
A federal tribunal in June ordered the creation of the Investigatory Commission for Truth and Justice, to be made up of victims' representatives, the National Human Rights Commission and the Federal Public Ministry. 
The current government has so far not given details on how this will occur.
At an emotional gathering of representatives and parents bearing photos of the trainee-teachers on the fourth anniversary of the students' disappearance, Lopez Obrador said that if the commission has not been set up by the time he takes office on Dec. 1, he will create it himself.
Lopez Obrador added that the commission would seek help from the United Nations and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR).
According to the government's version of events, the trainee-teachers were rounded up by corrupt police and handed over to a gang that killed them and burned their bodies in a nearby dump. 

But experts appointed by the IACHR said in a report in 2015 that account was riddled with errors.

CARACAS/PUNTO FIJO, Venezuela (Reuters) - Yusbell Arcaya used to earn more than seven times the minimum wage as a human resources analyst at a university in western Venezuela, but socialist President Nicolas Maduro's economic reforms changed all that.
Last month, Maduro unexpectedly ordered a 60-fold increase in the minimum wage to compensate for runaway inflation alongside a 96 percent devaluation of the bolivar currency. That left employers across Venezuela struggling to afford the new minimum wage, let alone the higher salaries once paid to more senior employees. 
So the Experimental Pedagogical University where Arcaya works is now paying her and all its employees the monthly minimum wage of 1,800 bolivars, roughly $18 at the black market exchange rate and up from about $2 previously.
Frustrated, the 39-year-old now dreams of fleeing the South American country, like millions of other Venezuelans.
""We all earn the same. I earn the same as the girl who presses a button to open the door,"" said Arcaya, who has worked at the university for 19 years. ""I studied and I worked hard. And now it turns out none of that was worth it."" 
Workers at hospitals, the Oil Ministry and insurance companies all said the pay hierarchy had been distorted following Maduro's shock measure. 
The president, who was re-elected to a new six-year term in May at elections boycotted by most opposition parties, said the reforms would shore up oil-rich Venezuela's moribund economy, which the International Monetary Fund estimates will shrink 18 percent this year. 
But the measure could further hollow out government institutions and private companies, as Venezuelans seek jobs in the more flexible informal sector or flee to neighboring South America countries. 
Once one of the wealthiest nations in Latin America, Venezuela has seen its economy unravel and violence steadily mount during two decades of socialist rule under Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez, who launched his Bolivarian Revolution in 1999.
It is unclear how many of Venezuela's roughly 13 million workers earn the minimum wage. The roughly 40 percent of Venezuelan workers who work in the informal sector will not be directly affected by the change. 
Yet teachers, doctors and government workers have staged protests to decry the lack of measures to ensure they earn more than the minimum, especially in the face of hyperinflation that the opposition-led congress estimates has reached 200,000 percent. 
SAPPING MORALE
While minimum wage earners are getting more, their money has to stretch farther due to inflation. 
""We used to earn a lot less,"" said Juan Pereira, a security guard at a mall in the city of Valencia, once a thriving industrial hub. But he said the problem was that rampant inflation was eroding the value of the bolivar currency.
""What surprises me is that everyone speaks about 1,000 bolivars now as if it were nothing. A pair of shoes, repairing the fridge, spare parts for the motorcycle - everything is 1,000 as if it were that easy to earn.""
And for many skilled Venezuelans, the psychological hit of earning the same as everyone else has sapped morale and shaken up the pecking order. 
""No one is going to worry about hierarchies like director, sub-director, or supervisor now because it is pointless to have more responsibilities and earn the same,"" said Ildemaro Useche, the president of the Venezuelan Teachers Union's for the Andean state of Tachira.
Pay differences have also shrunk in Venezuela's army and banks. Staff at Venezuela's central bank even sent a complaint letter to its president, Calixto Ortega. 
""The system that is being implemented is incoherent, worsens the situation for active and retired workers and violates current laws,"" said the letter seen by Reuters. 
Venezuela's central bank did not respond to a request for comment.
At the Oil Ministry, which oversees Venezuela's vital energy sector, all employees are now paid minimum wage, according to two ministry workers. 
Next door at state oil company PDVSA, workers say the new wages have not yet been announced and the company has instead been paying one-off bonuses, according to union leader Jose Bodas and two employees.
Oil accounts for over 90 percent of Venezuela's foreign currency earnings, bankrolling the government, but production has fallen some 36 percent over the past year to 1.2 million barrels per day amid underinvestment, lack of maintenance and a brain drain.

The Oil Ministry and PDVSA did not reply to requests for comment.

Marcello Foa, who was nominated by the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League ruling parties, obtained the necessary two-thirds majority of support in the parliamentary committee that oversees RAI.
Foa's critics say he is a pro-Russian, anti-euro nationalist, who has promoted a far-right agenda in his journalistic career.
His appointment was held up for weeks after media mogul Silvio Berlusconi's center-right Forza Italia (Go Italia!) party, joined opposition center-left ranks to oppose his candidacy. 
However, Berlusconi gave Foa the green light last week after holding talks with League leader Matteo Salvini. Berlusconi has not explained his U-turn. Opposition politicians said he changed his position after receiving assurances that the government would not undermine his family's Mediaset firm.
""This move will slaughter pluralism, competence, respect for the rules and respect for professionalism within (RAI),"" said Michele Anzaldi, a senior figure in the center-left Democratic Party and a member of RAI's oversight committee in parliament.
As chairman, Foa will play an influential role in helping RAI's board set a strategy for the broadcaster.
""RAI is usually the place where new political projects are tested,"" said a RAI veteran journalist asking not to be mentioned. ""Foa will have a say on the quality of TV shows and news output ahead of European parliamentary elections.""
With a daily viewer share of almost 34 percent and more than 11,000 employees, RAI is arguably Italy's most important and influential media group. Its main competitor is Mediaset.
Foa has spent much of his journalistic career working for the right-wing Il Giornale newspaper that is owned by Berlusconi's brother.
In a confirmation hearing before the parliamentary committee, Foa defined himself as an ""old-style liberal ... committed to the defense of a plurality of information.""
Last May, Foa said on Twitter he was ""disgusted"" by the decision of President Sergio Mattarella to reject the appointment of euroskeptic economist Paolo Savona as economy minister.
The day after he told Russia Today, a Russian international television network funded by the Russian government, that Italy was facing a ""very serious crisis because the president is apparently violating the constitution"".

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - As British Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to face critics of her Brexit plan at her party conference at the weekend and her Labour opponents vow to vote against it in parliament, EU officials are increasingly uneasy about prospects for a deal.
Michel Barnier, the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator, told senior EU lawmakers on Tuesday he had concerns about meeting his announced target of an outline deal next month and final package in mid-November to avoid Britain crashing out, a person familiar with the meeting told Reuters.
To get there, EU leaders insist, May must make compromises.
Barnier himself tweeted on Wednesday that he was ""working for an orderly Brexit"" - Brussels-speak for averting a collapse of talks that could see Britain, and EU businesses and citizens, plunged into legal limbo on Brexit Day next March 29.
One diplomat involved in Brexit talks said his confidence that a deal was in the offing had started to recede. ""I am less optimistic now,"" he said. ""I'm not so sure any more.""
And in a reminder that May's potential difficulties in securing a parliamentary majority for any deal she can strike with Brussels could trigger what the EU has labeled a ""catastrophe"", a senior official working for European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker briefed ambassadors from the other 27 members on plans to deal with an abrupt British departure.
Diplomats and officials said Wednesday's discussions were a sign of determination to cope with a ""hard Brexit"" if Britain refuses to accept EU terms, but views were mixed on whether it signaled a greater degree of urgency or fears of a no-deal.
""There's a wish not to rock the boat with too much 'no deal' posturing,"" one EU diplomat said. ""It's simply a calendar issue - if we want to be sure we’re prepared, we need to move forward.""
""CHEQUERS BUNKER""
EU leaders at a summit last week in Salzburg shot down a proposal May agreed with her cabinet at her Chequers residence in July, whereby British goods would be treated like EU produce inside the bloc without being bound by EU legislation on how they are made.
While EU negotiators had not expected May to compromise on that plan ahead of her Conservative Party conference starting on Sunday, her tough tone in defense of ""Chequers"" - despite sharp opposition to it within her own party - has worried the EU.
""She's still in her Chequers bunker,"" one senior EU official said. ""She needs to shift -- but it's not clear that she can.""
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who will meet Barnier in Brussels on Thursday, said on the final day of his conference on Wednesday that the party would vote to block an EU deal based on Chequers.
Facing rebellion among Conservatives who say it binds Britain too much to EU rules, and opposition from those who want to keep even closer ties to the bloc or to stop Brexit, May's room for maneuver is limited, raising risks of an upset.
""There has been no progress for a while now in Brexit talks and the worry over a no-deal scenario is growing,"" said one EU diplomat involved in the negotiating process in Brussels.
""There is very little time left and I am not sure at all that a political agreement will emerge. Salzburg was meant to bring political positions closer, not to hype up rhetoric that seems to be ruling out chances for an agreement.""
Watching the British political debate - including talk of a snap election or even a new Brexit referendum - another diplomat said there was growing unease in Brussels that May would be unable to get unpalatable compromises over Northern Ireland's borders and UK trade access to the EU through parliament.
""The EU side always tends to think the rational solution will eventually prevail,"" the diplomat said. ""We may be underestimating the fervor looming in their parliament. 

""They may well choose to go without a deal in the end.""

RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian federal police raided the offices of two of the nation's largest highway operators on Wednesday, taking multiple executives into custody, the latest development in a wide-ranging corruption crackdown in South America's largest country.
Police detained 19 people and executed various search and seizure warrants throughout southern and southeastern Brazil, according to a law enforcement statement.
Authorities are investigating an alleged corruption ring in which public officials in the southern state of Parana received about 35 million reais ($8.67 million) in bribes between 1999 and 2015 from companies awarded highway contracts, the statement said.
The police said the operation was the 55th phase of Brazil's so-called Car Wash investigation, which started in 2014 and has deeply shaken Brazil's business and political establishment. Corruption has become a major campaign theme heading into October presidential and congressional elections.
Highway operator CCR SA said in a securities filing that police raided the firm's headquarters, the offices of subsidiary RodoNorte, and the residences of current and former executives. The police also took Jose Alberto do Rego Moita and Claudio Jose Machado Soares, the chief operating officer and former chief executive of RodoNorte, respectively, into five-day temporary custody, the firm said.
CCR said that it was working to clarify the facts and that an internal investigative committee would present its findings to the board, which would take any required measures.
Ecorodovias Infraestrutura e Logistica SA said in a separate filing that three of its offices in Parana and Sao Paulo were raided, and Evandro Couto Vianna and Mario Cezar Xavier Silva, both executives at subsidiaries, were taken into temporary custody.
Ecorodovias said it was cooperating with the authorities and had provided all requested information.
A third, privately-operated firm, Caminhos do Parana, said in a statement sent to Reuters that it was also a target of the operation, and that its chief executive was among those arrested.
""The company regrets what has occurred and considers jail unnecessary, given that the firm has been giving (the police) the necessary clarifications and has never declined to cooperate,"" Caminhos do Parana said.
While state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA, known as Petrobras, has been the most heavily affected by the Car Wash probe, the infrastructure sector has also been the target of investigations.
In August, Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported that CCR was negotiating a plea deal regarding alleged political corruption.
Brazil-listed shares in CCR were down 5.3 percent in early afternoon trade, while Ecorodovias fell 2.7 percent. Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index was up 0.3 percent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee called on the Trump administration on Wednesday to declare the Myanmar military's campaign against the country's Rohingya Muslim minority a genocide, days after a State Department report stopped short of that description.
""Making a formal determination of genocide must be the next step for the U.S.,"" Representative Ed Royce, the committee's chairman, told a hearing on the issue. ""Defining these atrocities for what they are is critical to building international public awareness – and support – to stop them."" 
The U.S. Department of State, which would make the determination, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Royce's statement at the hearing.
Royce held the hearing, titled ""Genocide Against the Burmese Rohingya,"" just two days after the State Department released a report finding that the military in Myanmar, also known as Burma, waged a ""well-planned and coordinated"" campaign of mass killings, gang rapes and other atrocities against the Rohingya.
But the report, which could be used to justify further U.S. sanctions against Myanmar authorities, did not describe the actions as genocide or crimes against humanity.
U.S. officials said use of language that stopped short of genocide was the subject of fierce debate within the administration that delayed the report for nearly a month. United Nations investigators issued a report a month ago accusing Myanmar’s military of acting with “genocidal intent.” 
Representative Eliot Engel, the top committee Democrat, said the administration should take action, such as referring the matter to the International Criminal Court. The ICC said earlier this month it had begun an examination of whether the alleged forced deportations of Rohingya could constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity.
Many members of Congress, including President Donald Trump's fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, have called for a stronger response to the crisis, in which almost 700,000 Rohingya have fled to neighboring Bangladesh.
A declaration of genocide by the U.S. government could have legal implications of committing Washington to stronger punitive measures against Myanmar. This has made some in the Trump administration wary of issuing such an assessment but pressure from members of Congress, particularly Republicans like Royce, could help influence a decision.
Several lawmakers have also asked the administration to press for the release of Reuters reporters Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, who were convicted on Sept. 3 under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act in a case seen as a test of democratic freedoms in Myanmar.
The reporters, who pleaded not guilty, said they were handed papers by police shortly before they were detained, and a police witness testified that they had been set up. They had been investigating the killing of 10 Rohingya men and boys as part of a military response to insurgent attacks.
Separately, two members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, ranking Democrat Bob Menendez and Republican Todd Young, asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo whether he had asked the Office of the Legal Adviser at the State Department for a formal legal determination of genocide.

""We ask that you provide a formal legal determination regarding the actions of the Burmese military to Congress without delay,"" they said in a letter seen by Reuters on Thursday. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter.

The Innovative Immunotherapy Alliance SA is the fruit of a three-year partnership between the Roswell Park Cancer Institute of Buffalo, New York and Cuba's Center for Molecular Immunology begun following the historic 2014 U.S.-Cuban detente.
Although U.S. President Donald Trump has partially unraveled that detente agreed by his predecessor President Barack Obama and Former Cuban President Raul Castro, projects undertaken during that rapprochement have continued apace.
The new joint venture will be headquartered in Cuba's Special Development Zone, offering companies tax cuts and other incentives and located at the Mariel Bay just west of Havana, Cuban state-run news agency Prensa Latina said.
Roswell Park also announced on Wednesday that initial results from a clinical trial of a Cuban-developed vaccine to extend the lives of lung cancer patients was ""safe, well tolerated and worthy of further study.""
Roswell Park said it had raised $4 millions in donations to fund the clinical trials of the CimaVax EGF drug.
That vaccine, and three further immunotherapy treatments developed in Cuba will be included in the Innovative Immunotherapy Alliance's portfolio of products, Prensa Latina said. 
In the first few years, the joint venture will focus on trialing those treatments to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, with the aim of eventually exporting them to the United States, the agency added.

BANJA LUKA, Bosnia (Reuters) - Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik, who has long called for the secession of his region from Bosnia, appears to have dramatically toned down that demand as the country approaches elections. 
The Balkan country holds parliamentary and presidential polls on Oct. 7 which many analysts see as a turning point that will decide if Bosnia will progress toward the EU and NATO integrations or remain stuck in ethnic rivalries.
Dodik, who presides over Bosnia's autonomous Serb Republic, is running for the Serb seat in the tripartite inter-ethnic presidency of Bosnia - a state he has in the past repeatedly called ""impossible"" and destined for dissolution.
But in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, the nationalist leader took a much more nuanced line, and defended the 1995 U.S.-brokered peace deal that ended Bosnia's war and established its current constitution.
""I am not against a possible Bosnia-Herzegovina, but not for one which erodes the Dayton peace agreement,"" Dodik said.
Under the Dayton deal, Bosnia was split into two highly autonomous regions, the Serb Republic and the Federation shared by Croats and Muslim Bosniaks, linked via a weak central government. An international envoy has been overseeing the country's peace.
""I am against Bosnia-Herzegovina which is run by foreigners who have made an impossible creation ... in which we don't have an internal dialogue,"" Dodik said, adding the Dayton accords had been invalidated over the years by the interventions of international overseers and judges.
Asked directly if he would continue to push for the secession of the Serb Republic and its integration with Serbia, the theme that has prevailed in his campaigning this month, Dodik said: 
""I will respect the Dayton peace agreement and I will respect the constitution, I am not ready to act against Dayton and against the constitution.""
Under the constitution, which is an integral part of the peace accords, neither of Bosnia's two regions has the right to secede.
NO TO NATO
Earlier this month Dodik told Serbian state TV: ""The second term of U.S. President Donald Trump will represent a chance for the reintegration of Republika Srpska (Bosnia's Serb Republic) with Serbia or its greater independence.”
The sudden change in rhetoric comes following the visit to Bosnia last week of Russia's Foreign Minister Segei Lavrov, who said there was no alternative to the Dayton agreement. Dodik has repeatedly said he favors closer ties with Russia than with the West.
If elected to the presidency which decides the country's foreign policy, Dodik said he would continue to support Bosnia's bid to join the European Union but not the Western military alliance.
""I am against Bosnia's accession into NATO,"" he said, noting that NATO warplanes had bombed Bosnian Serb positions and Serbia itself during the Balkan wars of the 1990s. 
Dodik said he was not optimistic that Bosnia could join the EU soon. 
The Bosnian Serb leader has recently intensified contacts with rightist leaders across Europe, and said he would talk to anyone who was legitimately elected. He said he would like to meet U.S. President Donald Trump's former strategist Steve Bannon. 

""I would ask him if Trump will win the next term,"" he said. ""He should know.""

GENEVA/LONDON (Reuters) - An attack on a military parade in Iran is a blow to the image of its Revolutionary Guards, but the elite force could yet turn the bloodshed to its advantage, using public sympathy to bolster itself at the expense of President Hassan Rouhani.
Twelve Guards were among 25 people killed on Sept. 22 when gunmen fired on a viewing stand as military officials watched a ceremony in the city of Ahvaz marking the start of Iran's 1980-1988 war with Iraq.
The bloodshed exposed vulnerabilities of the Guards, custodians of clerical rule since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, who have sought to project an image of invincibility.
Initial responses from ordinary Iranians have been largely sympathetic, however, with many posting on social media to express support for the security forces. 
""The fact that the attack took place on the anniversary of Iraq's invasion of Iran is likely to prompt a nationalistic backlash among Iranians,"" said Ali Vaez, Iran Project Director at the Crisis Group think-tank. Iran lost hundreds of thousands of soldiers in the war with Iraq.
Pictures of soldiers shielding women and children with their bodies or carrying them away from the scene were widely shared, while more than 20 newspapers used a photograph on their front pages of a commando cradling a baby while holding an AK-47. 
""See how a member of the Revolutionary Guards helps a child without fear. Salute to your courage!"" read one Twitter post, typical of thousands. 
But a small number of Iranians shared pictures of the harsh suppression of protests in 2009, when the Guards shot and ran down civilians in the streets.
The public reaction was similar to that seen last year after Islamic State militants attacked Iran's parliament and the mausoleum of the Islamic Republic's founder Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, killing 18.
ROUHANI COULD BE LOSER
The Ahvaz incident could prove more of a setback for Rouhani, a pragmatist leader whose position within Iran has been severely weakened by the U.S. withdrawal from a nuclear deal with world powers that he engineered and which the Guards and other hardliners opposed.
""The Guards will blame Rouhani for the lax situation and shore up their own agenda in the country,"" said Ali Ansari, director of the Institute for Iranian Studies at the University of St. Andrews.
""Rouhani is a lame duck. He's long lost the possibility of challenging the Guards,"" Ansari added. 
""He lost it with the [nuclear deal] and they’ve hammered him. That's the one gift that [U.S. President Donald] Trump has given to the Guards, further ammo."" 
The attack is nevertheless an alarming security breach for the Guards, who influence Iran's approach to its neighbors and control a multi-billion-dollar stake in the economy.
The Ahwaz National Resistance, an Iranian ethnic Arab separatist movement, and Islamic State have both claimed responsibility, though without presenting evidence.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the five gunmen were paid by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and that Iran would ""severely punish"" those behind the violence. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are predominantly Sunni Muslim while Iran is mostly Shi'ite Muslim.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE have rejected Khamenei's allegations. 
History suggests the Guards will react by oppressing dissidents, an approach that political activists warn could fuel further violence in the southwest, where the attack took place, and where long-standing grievances have led to sporadic protests. 
To deflect attention away from Iran, they may strike abroad, an approach used by the Guards before.
On Sept. 8, they fired seven missiles at a Kurdish opposition group in northern Iraq, killing 15 people. The judiciary executed three Kurdish dissidents hours later.
The two actions were intended as a message to Iran's Kurdish community after recent militant clashes with security forces and can be seen as a blueprint for the Islamic Republic's likely response to the parade attack. 
REGIONAL RIVALRIES
Iran has had tense relations with its minorities, including Kurds, Arabs, Azeris and Baluch, and has accused them of aligning with neighboring countries rather than Tehran.
The missile attack against the Kurdish opposition group was also a warning to Iran's foes Saudi Arabia, Israel and America, analysts, activists and opposition groups say.
Iran and Saudi Arabia are engaged in a battle for influence in the Middle East, backing opposing sides in the conflicts in Yemen and Syria as well as rival political groups in Iraq and Lebanon.
An Islamic State cell could have also carried out the parade attack, said an Iraqi military intelligence officer, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. 
After recent military defeats in Iraq, some of Islamic State's leadership crossed the mountainous border into Iran, heading for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said the officer, who has participated in the interrogation of Islamic State detainees.
They may have helped form and train small groups to launch guerrilla attacks. 
""[Islamic State] managed to launch terrorist attacks in the West through its self-dependent lone elements and carrying out such attacks inside Iran will be much easier profiting from [anti-government] feelings,"" the officer said.
For now, the Revolutionary Guards are tightening their grip at home. Human rights activists say they have arrested hundreds of Sunni activists and members of Arab separatist groups that have claimed responsibility for past attacks on oil pipelines.
Yaqoub Al-Tostari, spokesman for one of two groups that call themselves the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahwaz, denies any links to Gulf Arab states. 
""I can tell you that carrying and using a gun is a common practice among Ahwazi Arab people,"" he told Reuters by WhatsApp.
""After the cruel suppression of the civil movements, if our nation decides to resort to guns, it can deliver blows much bigger than this.""

Verzilov, publisher of a Russian online news portal with close ties to punk protest group Pussy Riot, fell ill two weeks ago in Moscow and was flown to Germany for urgent treatment.
Doctors at Berlin's Charite hospital have found no traces of poison in his body but say there is no other explanation than poisoning for his condition.
""I firmly believe that the Russian secret service is behind my poisoning, possibly Russia's GRU military intelligence,"" Verzilov told Bild newspaper in his first interview since being taken into the Charite.
""The poisoning was carried out so professionally that no other conclusion is possible.""
He said the secret services might have tried out a new poison cocktail on him, judging by the speed with which it took effect.
""It didn't take several days until I noticed something - it was acute immediately. I don't have any memories of the following days,"" he said.
Verzilov is known in Russia for protest stunts including briefly invading the pitch during the World Cup final in Moscow this year.
He told Bild he had wanted to investigate the killings of Russian journalists Orhan Dzhemal, Alexander Rastorguyev and Kirill Radchenko in the Central African Republic in July.
""That could be why the secret services wanted to poison me,"" he said. ""I think that is a more likely reason than the World Cup initiative.""
Verzilov said he wanted to go back to Russia, adding: ""I'm doing well now and I hope that I will be discharged as quickly as possible.""
Activists and security services are on high alert for poison attacks with origins in Russia following the poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Britain earlier this year, blamed by London on Moscow.

512,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",From Jupiter to jeers: France's Macron battles popularity slump,"By Luke Baker
PARIS (Reuters) - A little over a year ago, Emmanuel Macron was sitting pretty in the polls, a 39-year-old president in a hurry, with ambitious plans and the hopes of a nation riding on his shoulders. 
In recent months his popularity has crumbled, even falling below his luckless predecessor Francois Hollande at the same point in his presidency. Last week, Macron's approval rating was just 29 percent, down from a high of 66.
As if to hammer home the shift in sentiment, consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest level in more than two years. The same measure had soared in the wake of Macron's May 2017 election victory.
The reasons for the volte-face are multiple and overlapping: voters on the center-left, many of whom took a chance on Macron, say his policies, particularly cutting a wealth tax, favor the rich. They often describe his manner as arrogant.
A scandal involving an Elysee Palace security official, caught on camera beating up May Day protesters, has tarnished the president. It raised questions about how the young official, Alexandre Benalla, was promoted so quickly, while the Elysee's foot-dragging in response prompted suggestions of a cover-up.
In quick succession two ministers resigned, the popular environment minister over delays in reducing nuclear dependence, and the sports minister, for personal reasons. A third, interior minister Gerard Collomb, a close Macron ally, will step down next year to run again as mayor of his home city Lyon.
It is Collomb's departure that has perhaps thrust the knife in deepest. Before he announced his plans, he spoke of how the Macron team ""lacked humility"", and lamented several mistakes, in particular the handling of the Benalla affair.
So what does the dramatic slump in popularity mean for Macron and his ability to lead, at home and in Europe?
ONWARD AND UPWARD?
Close advisers are quick to say it means nothing. They acknowledge missteps, such as the Elysee's decision to release a video of Macron complaining about how much money was being spent on social benefits with little impact.
But they say he was elected on the promise of fundamental economic and social reforms and is determined to carry them out over the course of his five-year term, no matter what.
""The French people recognize two essential things: that the president sticks to his promises ... and that, while the pace of reform is extremely rapid, the impact is not yet visible on the ground and will take time to emerge,"" said a senior Elysee official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
There's an acknowledgement too that the macroeconomic picture is not as rosy as once predicted, with growth forecasts pared back and unemployment stuck at around 9 percent, both of which are hampering Macron's ability to deliver.
""French people are skeptical, this is the French culture,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters on Wednesday, urging voters to be patient.
""They are asking for concrete results and I think it takes time to get the full benefits of the reforms.""
Some voters are unwilling to give the benefit of the doubt.
""The slump in his poll ratings was inevitable,"" said Herve-Paul Jean, a 74-year-old Parisian. ""He went too fast. You can't change an old country like France as quickly as that.""
Another Paris resident, Regis, who did not want to give his full name, accused Macron of ""hammering the working class"".
""He gives to the richest, he really is the president of the rich,"" he said. ""The government really doesn't give a damn.""
POPULARITY COLLAPSE
There are also signs that the collapse in popularity, and agitation in parliament over the Benalla affair, are having some impact on the government's agenda.
Constitutional reforms planned for the autumn, including cutting the number of lawmakers by a third and introducing some proportional representation, have been delayed.
Nonetheless, with a large, loyal majority in the Assembly, Macron will likely not need to deviate too far off course. 
Perhaps in an effort to combat the ""president of the rich"" tag, two policy announcements in the space of a week this month targeted the sick and the poor: 8 billion euros of extra spending for the lowest earners, and an additional 400 million euros on healthcare.
The headline promises in the 2019 budget, briefed to journalists this week, emphasize money being returned to taxpayers rather than more reforms: 6 billion euros of tax cuts for households and moves to boost purchasing power.
But advisers say the overall reform agenda, plotted in detail before taking office, remains on track, with changes to pensions and unemployment benefits coming up.
Yet will Macron himself be chastened by the poll slump, adapting his style to try raise his appeal? 
The indications so far are no. Aides defend his straight-talking and sometimes punchy manner, which he mixes with ""Jupiterian"" speeches - lofty pronouncements as if handed down from the Roman god of gods.
He has been forthright about how he sees the EU elections next May as a battle between leaders like himself - who he describes as progressive, pro-EU liberals - and populist, far-right nationalists. 
The same sort of battle is likely to play out domestically in the next presidential election in 2022, with Macron already limbering up for a showdown with the far-right.
In a sign that the communications strategy is changing, the Elysee has drafted in a new smooth-talking spokesman, Sylvain Fort, who is cut from the same intellectual cloth as Macron.
Yet observers point out that while the tumbling polls make for good headlines, it's not out of the ordinary in France. Most presidents since World War Two have struggled to connect with voters 18 months into office.
""If you took away all the pollsters who say that Macron is unpopular, all the media commentary that says he's unpopular, where are the signs, actually, that he is that unpopular?"" said Sue Collard, a senior lecturer in French politics at the University of Sussex. ""You don't see them.""
The French want the advantages of change without the associated hardships, she says. Macron recognizes that and just needs to make sure he conveys the message right.

""I would imagine his communications team is telling him to be a little bit more careful, that's all,"" she said.

""She ... raised our consular cases in Iran, including that of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, before expressing her serious concern at Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s ongoing detention, and called for her release,"" it added in a statement on Wednesday.
Britain is seeking the release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation who was arrested in April 2016 at a Tehran airport as she headed back to Britain with her daughter after a family visit. 
She was jailed for five years after being convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran's clerical establishment, a charge denied by her family and the Foundation, a charity organization that operates independently of Thomson Reuters and Reuters News.
Earlier this month, the British Foreign Office advised British-Iranian dual nationals against all but essential travel to Iran, tightening up its existing travel advice and warning it has only limited powers to support them if they are detained.

May is due to speak at the General Assembly, and will also be meeting several other world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, during her trip.

514,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 10:15AM ET</span>","Eying EU, NATO, Macedonians set for referendum on changing state's name","By Kole Casule
SKOPJE (Reuters) - Fed up with Macedonia's economic woes, Solomon Bicakcic will vote ""yes"" in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to qualify for European Union membership and - many hope - usher in prosperity. 
""Something has to change, we cannot continue like this,"" Bicakcic, a 52-year-old pensioner, told Reuters. 
Macedonia's bids for EU and NATO membership were blocked by Greece until June when it struck a deal with Athens on the name of the ex-Yugoslav republic to end a 27-year-long dispute.
Greece maintained that Macedonia's name implied territorial claims to its northern province of the same name. 
Skopje must now formally adopt the name of Republic of North Macedonia, replacing Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, to emerge from decades of stagnation and instability.
To secure popular support for the required constitutional amendments, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government called a referendum with one question - are you for or against EU and NATO membership through implementation of the name deal. 
""NATO membership would bring stability and security, which is very important for investment,"" Zaev told Reuters after a referendum ""yes"" rally in the southern town of Demir Kapija.
He said he expected parliament to adopt the constitutional changes, enabling the small landlocked Balkan republic to join NATO next spring, once Greece's parliament ratifies the pact.
A recent poll by Macedonia's Telma TV found 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sunday. Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes. 
But whether turnout does exceed the minimum 50 percent for the referendum to be valid is uncertain given a boycott campaign backed by nationalists opposed to the name change, including a group linked to Russia's ruling party. 
""Russia is openly saying it is against Macedonian membership in NATO and the EU, and we understand the position of Russia, but all our friends should know there is no alternative for us,"" Zaev, a Social Democrat, said.
Macedonia's economy stalled last year on the back of a two-year financial crisis with unemployment exceeding 20 percent, one of the highest rates in the Balkans, and an average monthly net salary of 350 euros ($411), the lowest in the region. 
""This isn’t living, this is surviving,"" Bicakcic said.
Western diplomats regard integration of the Western Balkan countries into NATO and the EU as the best way to stabilize and develop a region still suffering instability lingering from the 1990s wars triggered by Yugoslavia's break-up.
BOYCOTT CAMPAIGN
Although a vast majority of Macedonians support NATO and EU membership, many may be reluctant to vote on Sunday because of objections - common among nationalists and conservatives - to changing the country's name.
The boycott campaign has made effective use of social media - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter - and spread ""fake news"", critics say. 
The Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity said on Wednesday it had uncovered evidence that automated Twitter accounts had swung ""behind an effort to suppress voter turnout"".
""New accounts (created less than 60 days ago) make up 10 percent of the conversation – a figure higher than in the recent Mexican and almost three times higher than in the Italian elections,"" it said in an emailed statement to Reuters. 
One of the main pro-boycott opposition parties is United Macedonia, which has ties with the United Russia party of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""It is interesting how much all fake news pages reflect stances similar to Russia Today and other Russian (media) outlets,"" said Florian Bieber of Austria's Graz University. 
U.S. Defence Secretary James Mattis has accused Russia of meddling in the referendum by trying to suppress turnout.
Last week Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov denied that Moscow had done anything ""which could be interpreted as favoring a particular vote ... We do not say anything."" 
Macedonia's main opposition, nationalist VMRO-DPMNE party strongly opposed the name change deal. It has not taken a position on the referendum, instead urging faithful to vote or boycott it according to their conscience. 
Even if a referendum ""yes"" emerges, that may not settle the matter - ratification by Greece is no sure thing given divisions in the ruling-left right coalition. A right-wing party in the bloc vows to vote ""no"" when the matter comes before parliament early next year, defying Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.

OSLO (Reuters) - A Russian detained in Norway on suspicion of illegal intelligence activities at the Norwegian parliament can be held for two weeks, a Norwegian court ruled on Wednesday.
The Borgarting Court of Appeals said there was evidence that Mikhail Bochkaryov had collected information from computer and wireless networks at the parliament last week, upholding a decision by a lower court. 
Assurances by the Russian Embassy in Oslo that he would not leave the country without permission if released were insufficient, it added.
""It is not probable that the suspect acted alone,"" it said.
The Russian foreign ministry has demanded Norway lift ""the absurd charges"" and release Bochkaryov, whom it identified as a staff member of the Russian parliament's upper house.
Bochkaryov was detained on Friday at Oslo airport as he prepared to fly out after attending an international seminar on digitalization at Norway's parliament.
Norway's police security service, the PST, told Reuters it had asked to be allowed to hold the Russian for two weeks to prevent destruction of evidence, while the parliament's administration took preventive measures in case security had been breached.
Hege Aakre, Bochkaryov's lawyer, told Reuters her client denied any wrongdoing and regarded the incident as a ""misunderstanding"". There was ""no basis for the suspicion against him"".

""We're working diligently to make sure we get the conditions right so that we can accomplish as much as possible during the summit. But we hope it will be soon,"" Pompeo said in an interview with ""CBS This Morning.""
""It may happen in October but more likely sometime after that.""
Trump held an unprecedented summit with Kim in Singapore in June that yielded a broad pledge by Kim to ""work toward"" denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
Kim’s commitments and actions, however, have fallen far short of Washington’s demands for a complete inventory of North Korea’s weapons programs and irreversible steps to give up a nuclear arsenal that potentially threatens the United States.
""It will take a while; there will be a process to this,"" Pompeo said. ""President Trump's been clear about that and clear-eyed about that since the very beginning.""
Asked if Kim had agreed to allow international inspectors into nuclear sites, Pompeo said, ""Yes.""
He did not, though, comment on whether any U.S. or international inspectors had been allowed into nuclear sites in the reclusive communist country but said verification was important in any nuclear agreement.
""We've talked about this verification from the beginning,"" he told CBS. ""We're not going to buy a pig in a poke. We're going to get this right. We're going to deliver on this commitment (to denuclearize) that Chairman Kim has made to the world.""

519,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>","Pope asks China to show 'trust, courage and farsightedness' in new relationship","By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis urged China's leaders on Wednesday to move ahead with ""trust, courage and farsightedness"" after Beijing and the Vatican struck a landmark agreement on the appointment of bishops.
In Beijing, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said China was sincere about wanting better relations with the Vatican and that the bishops' agreement was an important step forward.
The accord, which critics have called a sellout to the Communist government, gives the Vatican a say in the choice of bishops in China. It could also be a precursor to restoring diplomatic ties with Beijing after more than 70 years. The Vatican only has diplomatic ties with Taiwan, China's rival.
In a message addressed to Chinese Catholics, Francis said that while they should be good citizens of their country, they should not shrink from offering ""a word of criticism"" when necessary to defend human dignity.
China's 12 million Catholics have been split between an underground church swearing loyalty to the Vatican and the state-supervised Catholic Patriotic Association. The Vatican said the absence of a deal could have led to a schism between Chinese Catholics that would have been difficult to heal.
The pope's five-page message included a section in which he addressed Chinese government leaders directly, saying he wanted to ""renew my invitation to continue, with trust, courage and farsightedness, the dialogue begun some time ago"".
He said the Vatican would ""work sincerely for the growth of genuine friendship with the Chinese people"".
With the accord, which both sides have said is provisional and will not be published , the Beijing government effectively recognises the pope as leader of all Catholics in China.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang welcomed the agreement, saying: ""China is willing to continue to meet the Vatican side halfway and have constructive dialogue, increasing understanding and accumulating mutual trust, to promote the process of continuing to improve relations.""
""FRATERNAL JOURNEY""
Francis said he realised that some Chinese Catholics who have been persecuted for their loyalty to him might feel abandoned but urged them to have faith in the new arrangement.
""Open your hearts and minds to discern the merciful plan of God, who asks us to rise above personal prejudices and conflicts between groups and communities, in order to undertake a courageous fraternal journey in the light of an authentic culture of encounter,"" he said.
Rights groups accuse China of human right violations, something that critics of the agreement have highlighted.
The pope said Chinese Catholics should love and serve their country, but added their faith mandated them to defend values.
""At times, this may also require of them the effort to offer a word of criticism... for the sake of building a society that is more just, humane and respectful of the dignity of each person,"" he said.
New bishops will now first be proposed by members of local Catholic communities together with Chinese authorities. The names will then be sent to the Vatican and the pope will have the final say.
As part of the deal, the pope recognised the legitimacy of seven bishops whom the government named without papal approval.

Since the deal was signed, the Vatican has not mentioned Taiwan, which Beijing sees as a rebel province. China does not allow countries to have diplomatic ties with both it and Taiwan.

Clashes between mostly lighter-skinned Tuareg and black Fulani herdsmen, generally over land and watering points, have killed dozens of civilians this year.
That has compounded an already dire security situation in the country's north, where attacks by jihadist groups are common. 
Tuesday's raid on a remote desert village in the Menaka region near the border with Niger killed 16 people, Bajan Ag Hamatou, a member of parliament from the area, told Reuters. 
""Armed men entered a Tuareg campsite and killed all the men they found,"" Hamatou said. ""They were attacked by their Fulani brothers.""
The mayor of the nearby town of Menaka, Nanout Kotia, said the attack killed 15 or 16 Tuaregs and appeared to have been motivated by inter-ethnic tensions. 
Islamist militants seized Mali's desert north in 2012. French forces intervened the following year to wrest back control, but fighters with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State have since regrouped. 
They have tapped into the ethnic rivalries to recruit new members and their frequent attacks in Mali and neighboring countries have alarmed Western powers. 
An armored vehicle carrying French forces in the northern Kidal region set off a mine on Wednesday but no one was hurt and it was not immediately clear who was responsible, four local residents told Reuters.

""The photo has made the police an involuntary actor in a very sensitive political debate which they should not participate in,"" said Marcus Knuth, a lawmaker with the anti-immigrant Liberal Party, which is the biggest in the government.
He and others alerted the independent complaints body over the gesture. ""The police's job is to enact the law, not to hug people who are against it,"" he said.

""It is complete nonsense. As my client said, if it had been any other person in the same situation she would have done the same, so it has nothing to do with her wearing the niqab,"" Koch said. 
The ban has exposed deep divisions in Danish society, with some arguing it upholds secular and democratic values and others that it infringes on freedoms of religion and self-expression.

526,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2018 06:28AM ET</span>",Demolition on the Nile puts squeeze on two Cairo districts,"By John Davison and Mahmoud Mourad
CAIRO (Reuters) - Impoverished residents of red brick homes on an island in the Nile look nervously across the river at another Cairo slum, bulldozed this summer into a wasteland of rubble.
Both areas are earmarked for tourism or business developments, part of efforts by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to attract investment and boost an economy still reeling after Egypt's Arab Spring upheaval of 2011.
Since taking office in 2014, Sisi has sought to transform Cairo, building a new administrative capital on its outskirts and aiming to turn the city center into an investor's dream. Glossy magazine adverts make Cairo look more like Dubai, with glitzy tower blocks on the banks of the Nile.
But there is an obstacle to that vision: people living there. Many say they do not want to leave, and have not been told what will happen to the districts they have called home for generations.
The plan for the Nile island, Warraq, is being overseen by the army and a government housing body. Areas scheduled for development include slums where authorities say residents have built illegally on state or privately owned land for decades, such as Warraq and the nearby area razed this summer, Maspero.
Under pressure from former general Sisi to transform those areas, authorities have either attempted forced evictions or offered compensation in money or property.
Officials say the thousands evacuated are making way for projects that will bring prosperity to all Egyptians, and that some residents will return when development is completed.
Inhabitants are not convinced.
They say their livelihoods, from running shops to farming and fishing, will be destroyed if they are forced to move far away, sometimes to isolated desert compounds. They complain that compensation for vacating prime real estate is small, and believe they will end up worse off.
""Development is great, but we don't think it's meant for us,"" said Hussein Zeidan, a building contractor living on Warraq, a large green island near downtown Cairo that is home to nearly 100,000 people.
Warraq has seen the strongest local resistance to evictions. A protester died in clashes last year between residents and security forces who came to demolish homes.
""The demolitions came without warning. Only after the clashes did officials try to reassure us the area is being developed for us,"" Zeidan said.
Weeks before the violence, Sisi had told government ministers live on TV: ""There are islands on the Nile, which legally should not have people on them. Make dealing with them a priority.""
Authorities have since softened their approach, trying to coax people out with offers to buy their land or provide them with apartments at Asmarat, a sprawling housing complex on Cairo's desert outskirts.
""The offers aren't enough - about 1,400 pounds ($80) per square meter. That's too little to be able to afford other land in Cairo,"" Zeidan said.
Other residents say prices on the bank opposite the island are closer to 8,000 pounds ($450) per square meter. 
Living in Asmarat would put many of the island's inhabitants out of work, they say.
""People who work on Warraq are farmers and fishermen, and they want to put them in an apartment in the desert - where would their animals go?"" said one woman who declined to be named for fear of reprisals by authorities.
YACHT-FILLED MARINAS
Zeidan said officials also told residents the development can take place without them leaving the island.
But with demolition orders on 700 buildings, according to a 2017 interior ministry statement, and the rest of Warraq occupied by houses or farmland, thousands think they will have to leave.
Development is underway. A half-built multi-lane road bridge crosses the Nile and swings into Warraq, dwarfing housing blocks and farmland.
Satellite images show dozens of buildings were demolished for the highway last year. Reuters reporters were prevented by police from reaching the island to interview residents.
The plans for Warraq are not yet clear. Designs from several years ago, still laid out on the website of one Egyptian architectural firm, show it as a modern mini-city with yacht-filled marinas. The firm, Cube Consultants, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The pro-government Youm 7 news website in April quoted officials as saying the island will become a ""high-end tourist housing project"".
In June, the government announced it would ""establish a new housing community on lands of Warraq island"", without elaborating. In interviews with Reuters, officials declined to give details of development plans.
NO CLEAR PLAN
Rights activists say people are being displaced even before projects are finalised and their long-term benefits assessed.
They point to both Warraq and Maspero, an area owned by Egyptian, Saudi and Kuwaiti companies, which was cleared of slum housing earlier this year.
""Even after people moved, there was still no detailed plan for the area,"" said Ibrahim Ezzedine, a housing researcher with the Egyptian Centre for Rights and Freedoms.
Khaled Saddeek, director of Egypt's Informal Settlement Development Fund, a government body, said Maspero would be a hub for ""business, hotels, offices and housing"", but declined to elaborate. ""The plan is not final yet,"" he said. 
The proprietor companies might develop the area on their own, or jointly with Egyptian authorities - it was not yet clear - depending on which companies decided to ""participate in development"", he said.
The 60,000 pounds ($3,300) per room Maspero residents were paid to leave their homes, plus 40,000 pounds ($2,200) of social support, was generous, Saddeek said.
He said some Maspero evacuees would return after the three years set aside for development, to rent or buy apartments. Under a rent-to-buy system the flats would cost at least 360,000 pounds ($20,000). Buying outright would cost 750,000 pounds ($42,000).
Hundreds of Maspero families who cannot afford this, even with compensation, now live in Asmarat. ""They're far from work with few other job opportunities. The closest shop is an expensive supermarket. These people live below the poverty line,"" Ezzedine said.
New residents of Asmarat declined to be interviewed, saying they feared reprisals for talking to reporters. Entrances to the area are guarded by security forces.
Hisham Abu al-Ela, a businessman in Maspero whose home on the edge of the area also faces demolition, said he would stay until the bulldozers came.

""We're not anti-development. We just want to be included - not kicked out.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - An Indiana U.S. Senator seen as one of the chamber's most vulnerable Democrats has a slight edge while four of his Rust Belt Democratic colleagues have solid leads in states President Donald Trump won in 2016, a Reuters poll found.
A Reuters/Ipsos/UVA Center for Politics Poll released on Wednesday found that a majority of likely voters in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana disapprove of the Republican president and more than one-third were ""very motivated"" to back someone who would oppose his policies.
The poll found that Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana has a 3 percentage point lead among likely voters over Republican businessman Mike Braun. Braun, a former state representative, has positioned himself as a Trump-like candidate who would bring an outsider's perspective to politics in Vice President Mike Pence's home state.
Democrats are aiming to win two more Senate seats in the Nov. 6 congressional election to take a majority in that chamber and serve as a check on Trump's agenda. They can ill afford to lose any of the five seats covered by the poll.
Trump won the five states after pitching himself as a business-savvy pragmatist who would improve the lives of working class Americans. Two years later, more than half of likely voters in those states think the country is now on the ""wrong track,"" the poll found.
""There are lots of places in this region where economic opportunity has been stifled,"" said Kyle Kondik, a political analyst at the Center for Politics. 
Kondik said the Rust Belt frequently shifts its support between parties, in some cases because voters who are frustrated with the lack of economic progress come to the ballot box intent on checking the party in power. 
This year Democrats have the added advantage of being able to attack an unpopular president as well as Republicans' deficit-increasing tax plan and their failed effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, he said.
To see poll results: https://tmsnrt.rs/2piev5l
The state polls were conducted online, in English, from Sept. 12 to Sept. 21. They surveyed between 1,074 and 1,181 likely voters in each of five states and weighted the responses according to the latest government population estimates. 
The polls each have a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 3 percentage points, meaning the results could vary in either direction by that much.
The results measured how voters felt at the time of the survey. Those feelings may change: In 2016, one in eight Americans said they made their presidential pick in the week before Election Day, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.
BLUE WAVE IN WISCONSIN?
The wave of support for Democrats may unseat Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, a Republican former presidential candidate who became popular in conservative circles for taking on unions. 
Walker trailed Democratic state schools superintendent Tony Evers by 7 percentage points.
In the Ohio governor's race, Republican Mike DeWine fared better. DeWine, the state's attorney general, held a 1 point edge over Democrat Richard Cordray, who is also seeking to succeed Governor John Kasich, a Trump critic.
Elsewhere, the poll found Democratic candidates on solid footing. 
In Pennsylvania, U.S. Senator Bob Casey Jr., a Democrat, led Republican congressman Lou Barletta by 16 points, and in the governor's race incumbent Democrat Tom Wolf was ahead of Republican Scott Wagner by 17 points. 
In Michigan, U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat, led Republican challenger John James by 20 points, while Democrat Gretchen Whitmer was ahead of Republican Bill Schuette by 13 points in the governor's race. 

In Ohio, incumbent U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown led Republican Jim Renacci by 11 points.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland and the European Union have been negotiating the terms of a treaty that would cement ties between the neutral country and its biggest trading partner. 
WHAT WOULD A TREATY DO?
The European Commission has been pushing for a decade for a treaty that would sit atop an existing patchwork of 120 sectoral accords and have the Swiss routinely adopt changes to rules governing the single market of 500 million people. It would also provide a more effective platform to resolve disputes, providing more legal certainty and strengthening commercial ties. 
WHY NOW?
Negotiations have dragged on for five years as the sides wrangle over just how to settle disputes, state aid rules and Swiss regulations for EU workers on temporary cross-border assignments. The last point could be a dealbreaker -- Swiss labor unions and small business refuse to budge on rules designed to protect high Swiss wages from foreign competition. The European Commission and the Swiss government have said they want a deal by year's end, before elections in both Switzerland and the EU next year shuffle the political deck and potentially intensify the rhetoric. 
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES?
After European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker last year proposed letting joint arbitration panels rather than the European Court of Justice handle some disputes, talks were making good progress. The offer helped defuse arguments from the right-wing and anti-EU Swiss People's Party, the largest in parliament, that foreign judges should not be allowed to dictate to the sovereign Swiss. But negotiations ran aground again when Switzerland's normally pro-Europe center left balked at adapting the labor rules, a demand from Brussels. With both the left and right opposed to a deal, the treaty would hardly have a chance of surviving a referendum that would be likely under the Swiss system of direct democracy.
WHAT IF TREATY TALKS FAIL?
The 120 sectoral accords would stay in effect, but bilateral relations would enter a deep freeze. The Commission has threatened not to extend beyond this year recognition of Swiss stock exchange rules that allow cross-border trading, which could touch off tit-for-tat escalation. Failure to strike a deal means no increase in Swiss access to the single market, dashing hopes for a new electricity union. It could also endanger unfettered EU market access for Swiss makers of products such as medical devices, should agreements on mutual recognition of industrial standards lapse.

WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH BREXIT?
Technically, nothing, but the separate negotiations exert gravity on each other. Unlike Britain and its messy EU divorce, Switzerland is dead set on staying anchored in the single market and allowing the free movement of citizens. But Juncker has warned against letting the Swiss talks drag on into the crunch phase of Brexit negotiations, and Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis has cited the difficulty of striking deals when EU counterparts are loath to make any concessions that Brexiteers may seize on.

Mitiga airport was shut after rockets were fired in its direction. Flights were diverted to Misrata airport about 190 km (120 miles) east of Tripoli.
""The carriers are expected to resume flights by the beginning of next week "" the administration said.
The facility, a former U.S military basei, closed twice this month due to indiscriminate shelling but no severe damages were reported.
At least 115 people were killed and more than 380 wounded in the fighting that pitted the Seventh Brigade, or Kaniyat, from Tarhouna, a town 65 km (45 miles) southeast of Tripoli, against the Tripoli Revolutionaries' Brigades (TRB) and the Nawasi, two of the capital’s largest armed groups.

Tripoli and western Libya are run by a U.N.-backed government mainly supported by armed groups, while eastern Libya is controlled by a rival administration. The country has been riven since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011.

The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration is spearheading a campaign to catch pigeons and has vowed to impose a ban on feeding them - violators could be jailed for up to three months, face a 25,000 baht ($770) fine, or both.
""There's a risk to humans in places where there is a high concentration of pigeons,"" Taweesak Lertprapan, deputy Bangkok governor, told Reuters as bird catchers caught pigeons around him at a public square.
Other cities around the world have imposed similar bans, including Italian tourist favorite Venice where feeding pigeons is illegal - but there is no threat of serving time.
In Bangkok, pigeons - often dubbed ""rats with wings"" - are often found in crowded areas, including temples, markets and public parks.
Taweesak said health risks from pigeons include respiratory diseases, meningitis and bird flu.
""The most effective solution is to stop feeding them,"" Taweesak said.

Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha this month ordered a nationwide campaign to reduce the number of pigeons in populated areas.

New bishops will be proposed by members of local Catholic communities together with Chinese authorities, and the names of candidates sent to the Vatican. Critics labeled the deal a sellout to the Communist government.
Speaking at a daily news briefing in Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China was sincere about wanting better relations with the Vatican and the bishops agreement was an important step in improving ties.
""China is willing to continue to meet the Vatican side halfway and have constructive dialogue, increasing understanding and accumulating mutual trust, to promote the process of continuing to improve relations,"" Geng said, without elaborating.
The Vatican statement about the deal did not mention Taiwan, which the Holy See recognizes diplomatically and which China claims as a wayward province.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said in a weekend statement that it hoped the China-Vatican deal could help improve religious freedom in China.
""As the world watches China increasingly tightening control over religious practices, Taiwan trusts that the Holy See has made appropriate arrangements to ensure that Catholic adherents in China will receive due protection and not be subject to repression,"" it said. 
A Taiwan government delegation will visit the Vatican next month to attend the canonization ceremony for Pope Paul VI, it added.

China's official Catholic Church reaffirmed its loyalty to the country's ruling Communist Party on Sunday, while welcoming a landmark deal struck with the Vatican on appointing new bishops.

Ralph Brinkhaus told ZDF broadcaster late on Tuesday that his election as the leader of the conservative group in the Bundestag lower house of parliament was an ""internal vote"" that should not be overstated.
Asked whether Merkel should now ask for a vote of confidence in the Bundestag, Brinkhaus said: ""That's nonsense.""
Merkel had asked her fellow lawmakers on Tuesday to re-elect her long-standing ally Volker Kauder as head of the parliamentary group. Brinkhaus, 50, scored a 125-112 victory over Kauder, 69.
The upset, described as a ""political thunderbolt"" and ""the beginning of the end of the Merkel era"" by opposition leaders, was widely taken as a sign that lawmakers want more say in shaping the policies of her fourth and final government.

Newspaper commentators said the vote also reflected rising discontent with Merkel's 13-year-old leadership.

The procurement office did not give a reason for the delay or say when the tender would be launched. ""As soon as a new date is fixed, we will inform you immediately"", it said in the short letter.
The Bundeswehr, the German military, is due to receive 45 to 60 heavy-lift transport helicopters in the coming decade.
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen earlier indicated the tender could be delayed as financing of the project was not yet secured in the ongoing parliamentary budget negotiations.
Von der Leyen, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, is pushing for steeper military spending hikes, but she faces resistance from the Social Democrat-led finance ministry, which prefers more spending on infrastructure and digitalization.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the validity of India's ambitious biometric identity project, 'Aadhaar', saying it benefited the marginalized and poor, but sharply reined in a government push to make it mandatory for various services.
In a ruling with far-reaching consequences, a panel of five judges cleared the use of Aadhaar for welfare schemes, saying it empowered the poor and marginalized.
A majority of the panel ruled the program had merits, but struck down a government effort to make its use mandatory in applications for services ranging from bank accounts to mobile telephone connections and school admissions.
""I think this is a fabulous judgment,"" said lawyer Kapil Sibal, a member of the opposition Congress party, who had argued in court against the sweeping use of Aadhaar as a means of identification.
""It takes care of citizens' rights and it ensures we don't have a surveillance state in place, it ensures that our privacy is not intruded into, and at the same time, it protects the rights of the marginalized,"" Sibal told television channel CNN-IBN in an interview as the ruling was being delivered.
Among other objectives, the project aims for a unique Aadhaar number, tied to an individual's iris scan and fingerprints, to help block theft and leakages in India's $23.6-billion-a-year food welfare program.
The court also ruled unconstitutional the use of Aadhaar by companies to establish an individual's identity.
Media have reported several cases of Aadhaar breaches, but Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which manages the program, and other supporters, argue the system is foolproof and secure. 

""The reason why we challenged (it) was because it went beyond the public distribution system, beyond protecting the marginalized, and tried to create a surveillance state,"" Sibal added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said a Turkish court, not politicians, will decide the fate of an American pastor whose detention on terrorism charges has hit relations between Ankara and Washington.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday he was hopeful Turkey would release evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson this month. The preacher was moved to house arrest in July after being detained for 21 months. 
In an interview with Reuters late on Tuesday while he was in New York for the United Nations General Assembly meetings, Erdogan said any decision on Brunson would be made by the court.
""This is a judiciary matter. Brunson has been detained on terrorism charges ... On Oct. 12 there will be another hearing and we don't know what the court will decide and politicians will have no say on the verdict,"" Erdogan said. 
If found guilty, Brunson could be jailed for up to 35 years. He denies the charges. ""As the president, I don't have the right to order his release. Our judiciary is independent. Let's wait and see what the court will decide,"" Erdogan said.
U.S. President Donald Trump, infuriated by Brunson's detention, authorized a doubling of duties on aluminum and steel imported from Turkey in August. Turkey retaliated by increasing tariffs on U.S. cars, alcohol and tobacco imports. 
The Turkish lira has lost nearly 40 percent of its value against the dollar this year on concerns over Erdogan’s grip on monetary policy and the diplomatic dispute between Ankara and Washington.
""The Brunson case is not even closely related to Turkey's economy. The current economic challenges have been exaggerated more than necessary and Turkey will overcome these challenges with its own resources,"" Erdogan said.
Turkey’s central bank raised its benchmark rate by a hefty 625 basis points this month, boosting the lira and possibly easing investor concern over Erdogan's influence on monetary policy. Erdogan said he was against the measure.
""It shows the central bank is independent. As the president, I am against high interest rates and I am repeating my stance here again,"" he said, adding that high rates ""primarily scare away investors"".
""This was a decision made by the central bank ... I hope and pray that their expectations will be met because high rates lead to high inflation. I hope the other way around will happen this time.""
The lira firmed slightly on Wednesday morning, after Erdogan's assurance on the independence of the central bank was published.
IMPROVING TIES 
In an effort to boost the economy and attract investors, Erdogan will travel on Sept. 28 to Germany, a country that is home to millions of Turks. 
""We want to completely leave behind all the problems and to create a warm environment between Turkey and Germany just like it used to be,"" Erdogan said, adding that he will meet Chancellor Angela Merkel during his visit.
The two NATO members have differed over Turkey’s crackdown on suspected opponents of Erdogan after a failed coup in 2016 and over its detention of German citizens.
On Syria, Erdogan said it was impossible for Syrian peace efforts to continue with President Bashar al-Assad in power.
Earlier this month, Turkey and Russia reached an agreement to enforce a new demilitarized zone in Syria's Idlib region from which ""radical"" rebels will be required to withdraw by the middle of next month.
But Erdogan said the withdrawal of ""radical groups"" had already started.
""This part of Syria will be free of weapons which is the expectation of the people of Idlib ... who welcomed this step,"" he said. The demilitarized zone will be patrolled by Turkish and Russian forces.
Close to 3 million people live in Idlib, around half of them displaced by the war from other parts of Syria. 
Erdogan said Turkey will continue to buy natural gas from Iran in line with its long-term supply contract despite Trump's threats to punish countries doing business with Iran. 
""We need to be realistic ... Am I supposed to let people freeze in winter? ...Nobody should be offended. How can I heat my people's homes if we stop purchasing Iran's natural gas?,"" he said. 

Trump pulled the United States out of a 2015 multinational nuclear deal with Iran and in August Washington reimposed sanctions on Tehran, lifted in 2016 under the pact. U.S. sanctions on Iran’s energy sector are set to be re-imposed in November.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bangladesh's leader accused neighboring Myanmar of finding new excuses to delay the return of more than 700,000 Rohingya who were forced across the border over the past year, and said in an interview late Tuesday that under no circumstance would the refugees remain permanently in her already crowded country.
""I already have 160 million people in my country,"" Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said, when asked whether Bangladesh would be willing to walk back its policy against permanent integration. ""I can't take any other burden. I can't take it. My country cannot bear.""
Hasina was speaking to Reuters in New York, where she is attending the annual United Nations meeting of world leaders.
The prime minister, who faces a national election in December, said she does not want to pick a fight with Myanmar over the refugees.
But she suggested patience is growing thin with Myanmar's leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, and its military that she said wields the ""main power"" there.
Hasina has previously called on the international community to pressure Myanmar to implement the deal.
Calls to Myanmar's government spokesman, Zaw Htay, went unanswered. He said recently that he will no longer answer media questions by phone, but will answer questions at a biweekly press conference.
Rohingya fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh after a bloody military campaign against the Muslim minority in Myanmar's Rakhine State. The two countries reached a deal in November to begin repatriation within two months, but it has not started, with stateless Rohingya still crossing the border into Bangladesh and the refugee camps at Cox's Bazar.
""They agree everything, but unfortunately they don't act, that is the problem,"" Hasina said of Myanmar. ""Everything is set but ... every time they try to find some new excuse,"" she told Reuters.
Myanmar has said it is ready to take back the refugees and has built transit centers to house them initially on their return.
But it has complained that Bangladesh has not provided its officials with the correct forms. Bangladesh has rejected those claims and U.N. aid agencies say it is not yet safe for the refugees to return.
Given the delays, Bangladesh has been preparing new homes on a remote island called Bhasan Char, which rights groups have said could be subject to flooding. Cox's Bazar is also vulnerable to flooding but this year's monsoon season was light.
Hasina said building permanent structures for refugees on the mainland ""is not at all a possibility (and) not acceptable"" since they are Myanmar citizens and must return.
Rohingya regard themselves as native to Myanmar's Rakhine state, but are widely considered interlopers by the country's Buddhist majority and are denied citizenship.
Human rights groups and Rohingya activists have estimated thousands died in last year's security crackdown, which was sparked by attacks by Rohingya insurgents on security forces in Rakhine in August 2017.
This week, a U.S. government investigation reported that Myanmar's military waged a planned, coordinated campaign of mass killings, gang rapes and other atrocities against the Rohingya.
Myanmar has rejected similar findings as ""one-sided"" and said it had conducted a legitimate counterinsurgency operation.
Ahead of December's election, Hasina and her ruling Awami League have been on the defensive following student protests over an unregulated transport industry. The protest was triggered after a speeding bus killed two students in Dhaka.

However, the main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, has been in disarray after its leader and former prime minister, Khaleda Zia, was jailed for corruption in February - charges she says were part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.

EU leaders last week rejected British Prime Minister Theresa May's proposals for post-Brexit trade, standing firm on their position that the plan would undermine their cherished single market.
""The British made their choice, that's fine. Excuse me to say so brutally, but there are more important things for us than the future of the United Kingdom. It's the future of the European Union,"" Le Maire told a small group of foreign journalists on Tuesday.
""Any decision that gives European citizens the impression that you can leave the European Union and keep all the advantages would be suicidal,"" he added.
He said the priority was to strengthen the euro zone, notably by completing plans for a backstop for its bank resolution fund and creating a shared budget, so that it could cope with a new financial or economic crisis.
Paris is reluctant to let Britain's EU divorce talks drag on and President Emmanuel Macron said last week that he expected Britain to put forward new proposals next month.
May has insisted she is sticking with her ""Chequers"" plan, despite fierce opposition from some in her party. She has complained that the EU had not given her detailed reasons for its rebuff.
Macron's cabinet is holding meetings every two weeks to ensure practical preparations are in place should Britain leave the EU without a post-Brexit agreement in place.

Le Maire said far more was at stake for Britain as all estimates indicated Brexit would have only a limited impact on French economic growth.

China has pledged $57 billion to build power stations, major highways, new railways and high capacity ports along the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a key part of Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road plan to further tie China to Eurasia.
The sustainability of Chinese projects has come under fresh scrutiny in recent months, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in July warned that any potential International Monetary Fund bailout for Pakistan's troubled economy should not be used to pay off Chinese lenders. Both Beijing and Islamabad say the loans are sustainable.
China welcomes the good start made in its ""all-weather"" partnership with Pakistan following the election of the new government under Prime Minister Imran Khan, State Councillor Wang Yi told Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
But ""any conspiracies attempting to incite disharmony or interfere in China-Pakistan relations will not prevail,"" Wang added, without elaborating, according to a statement released by China's foreign ministry on Wednesday.
China and Pakistan should continue to make ""all-out"" efforts to promote the economic corridor, expand trade and reduce poverty to bring more benefits to the ordinary people of Pakistan, Wang said.
The relationship between China and Pakistan will not change, regardless of circumstantial changes, Qureshi told Wang, according to China's statement.
The corridor is ""extremely important"" to Pakistan and has brought ""deep impact"" for jobs, development and livelihood, and Islamabad will take effective measures to ensure the security of the entire route, he added.
Beijing has faced growing international criticism from rights groups, some western nations and United Nations human rights experts over its sweeping security crackdown in the far western region of Xinjiang, which borders Pakistan.
Islamabad, like most governments of majority Muslim countries, has so far remained silent on the issue, but a group of Pakistani businessmen whose Chinese wives and children have been trapped in Xinjiang are lobbying the new government to help pressure Beijing into allowing their release.

Beijing says it faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists in Xinjiang and has rejected accusations of mistreatment.

In his first public comments on the deal signed in Beijing on Saturday, he told reporters on the plane returning from a trip to the Baltics that while he realizes not everyone will understand the logic behind the agreement, he was confident in the ""great faith"" of Chinese Catholics.
""It's not (that the government) names them. It is a dialogue. But the pope will appoint them. Let that be clear,"" he said of the deal, which was more than 10 years in the making.
The deal gives the Vatican a long-desired say in the choice of bishops in China, though critics labeled the deal a sellout to the Communist government.
In future, new bishops first will be proposed by members of local Catholic communities together with Chinese authorities. The names of candidates will be sent to the Vatican.
China's approximately 12 million Catholics have been split between an underground church swearing loyalty to the Vatican and the state-supervised Catholic Patriotic Association. The Vatican said the absence of a deal could have led to a schism between Chinese Catholics that would have been difficult to heal. 
""I think of the endurance of the Catholics who suffered. It is true that they will suffer. There is always suffering in an accord, but they have great faith,"" the pope said.
With the agreement, which both sides have said is provisional, the Chinese government effectively recognizes the pope as leader of all Catholics in China.
Even before it was signed, the prospects of such an agreement had divided communities of Catholics across China, some of whom fear greater suppression should the Vatican cede more control to Beijing.
'NO IMPROVISATION,' MORE THAN 10 YEARS OF TALKS
The pope tried to allay these fears, saying, ""When there is a peace accord or a negotiation, both sides lose something ... and we will move ahead.""
""This was no improvisation. It is a journey, a real journey,"" he said.
One of the most vocal critics has been Cardinal Joseph Zen, the 86-year-old former archbishop of Hong Kong.
""They're giving the flock into the mouths of the wolves. It's an incredible betrayal,"" Zen told Reuters in an interview two days before the agreement was signed. Its details will not be published.
Asked about such opposition to the agreement, the pope said: ""Let us pray for those who do not understand and for those who have been worshiping underground for so many years.""
As part of the deal, the pope recognized the legitimacy of the seven remaining state-appointed Chinese bishops who had been named without papal approval and that they had re-admitted them into the Church.
A Vatican statement issued when the agreement was signed on Saturday said it was ""not political but pastoral.""
It did not mention Taiwan, which the Vatican recognizes diplomatically and which China sees as a renegade province.
However, diplomats have said the accord was a possible precursor to a resumption in diplomatic relations with Beijing after 70 years. Beijing does not allow countries to have diplomatic relations with both China and Taiwan.
Taiwan now has formal relations with only 17 states and the Vatican is the only one in Europe.

(The story corrects the age of Cardinal Zen to 86 from 76 in paragraph 12)

ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (Reuters) - Pope Francis, facing clergy sex abuse scandals in several countries, said on Tuesday that the Roman Catholic Church has ""spared no effort"" to tackle the problem in recent years. 
But, speaking to reporters aboard the papal plane while returning from a four-day trip to the Baltics, the pope again appeared to indirectly acknowledge that the Church had hidden sexual abuse ""in the past century,"" saying that such cover-ups had been common in families as well.
Francis referred to a damning report last August by a U.S. grand jury on sexual abuse of children by priests in Pennsylvania over a 70-year period. He noted that the incidents of abuse diminished toward the end of the years covered in the report.
""In more recent times the number went down because the Church realized that it had to fight in a different way,"" he said.
""In olden times, these things were covered up, they were even covered up in homes, when an uncle raped a niece, when a father raped his children. It was covered up because it was an enormous shame. That was the mentality in the last century,"" he said.
""Look at the proportions (in the Pennsylvania report) and you will see that when the Church started becoming aware of this, it spared no effort,"" he said.
Francis appeared to be referring to new rules put into place for preventing and reporting sexual abuse in the United States following the first big media expose of abuse in Boston in 2002.
The atmosphere during the nearly one-hour news conference was somewhat tense as the pope insisted that he first answer questions directly related to his trip, which took him to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
Francis initially declined to take a question from a German reporter about the release of a research report hours earlier in her country that found that thousands of children had been sexually abused by clergy over a 70-year-period ending in 2014
He later began speaking about sexual abuse without being prompted.
""We all know the statistics (of the prevalence of sexual abuse within families), ... but as long as there is just one priest who abuses a boy or a girl this is monstrous because that man was chosen by God to lead children to heaven,"" Francis said.
The Church is grappling with a wave of new cases in countries including Chile, Germany and the United States.

Francis has come under fire from victims groups and other members of the Church who say he has not done enough to make bishops accountable for mishandling or covering up abuse cases.

545,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 10:23PM ET</span>",Wife of former Malaysian PM Najib questioned by 1MDB investigators,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Rosmah Mansor, the wife of former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak, arrived on Wednesday at the country's anti-graft agency for a second round of questioning over a corruption probe at state fund 1MDB.
Her questioning comes amid indications that more charges could be filed in the investigation into how billions of dollars went missing from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
Najib, who was ousted in a general election in May, has already been charged with money laundering, abuse of power and criminal breach of trust. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and has consistently denied wrongdoing.
Rosmah arrived at the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) headquarters around 0200 GMT, flanked by her lawyers and looking solemn. 
Her first round of questioning in June lasted three hours.
Last week, an MACC official said more charges could be brought against individuals over 1MDB.
When asked if Rosmah could face charges, the official said: ""I'm not denying that"".
Rosmah, 66, has long been in the public eye for flaunting a range of Hermes Birkin handbags and showy jewelry, and spending thousands of dollars in shopping sprees around the world.
Her penchant for designer goods has raised eyebrows in Malaysia, with many asking how she has been able to afford the luxury items on her husband's government salary. 
The couple's world has been turned upside down since Najib suffered a shock election defeat on May 9 to his one-time mentor Mahathir Mohamad, who swiftly reopened a probe into 1MDB. 
The U.S. Department of Justice has alleged more than $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB and that about $680 million ended up in Najib's personal bank account.
Najib and Rosmah have both been barred from leaving the country and their home and other properties linked to them have been searched by the police as part of the 1MDB investigations.
The haul seized from their homes - Malaysia's biggest and worth up to $275 million - included 567 handbags, 423 watches and 12,000 pieces of jewelry, including 1,400 necklaces, 2,200 rings, 2,800 pairs of earrings and 14 tiaras.
Rosmah has drawn comparisons to Imelda Marcos, who left behind more than 1,200 pairs of shoes when her husband Ferdinand Marcos was ousted as president of the Philippines in 1986.

Najib has said most of the items seized from his houses were gifts given to his wife and daughter and had nothing to do with 1MDB.

Gomes was attended at Sao Paulo's Sirio-Libanes hospital after doctors recommended he undergo the procedure following an exam. 
""The procedure was successful,"" Gomes' campaign said in its emailed statement. ""As it was a simple procedure, Ciro Gomes will be able to quickly return to his normal activities."" 
It said Gomes would spend the night in hospital and then campaign normally on Wednesday. It did not provide any more details on Gomes' health. 
The center-left Gomes is behind front-running, right-wing candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who has been hospitalized at the Albert Einstein hospital in Sao Paulo since being stabbed in an assassination attempt earlier this month.
Brazil's election is one of the most turbulent since the country's return to democracy three decades ago, coming after four years of unprecedented graft investigations revealed stunning levels of political corruption that has fanned voter disdain for the political class.
Gomes, a tough-talking former governor and finance minister, has worked to position himself as a moderate alternative between Bolsonaro, who has openly praised Brazil's 1964-85 dictatorship, and Workers Party's candidate Fernando Haddad, the hand-picked successor of the party's jailed leader, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who remains the country's most popular politician but is banned from running by his corruption conviction.

Polls indicate that a runoff vote is likely, a requirement if no candidate wins a majority in the first ballot on Oct. 7, and that Haddad would likely beat Bolsonaro.

Acapulco in southern Guerrero state, once a glamorous beach resort for Hollywood's rich and famous, has fallen on hard times as entrenched drug crime has transformed it into one of the most murderous cities in the world.
Guerrero is a hub for opium poppy production and the scene of frequent violent clashes between warring drug cartels.
The military personnel, along with federal and state police and the Guerrero state's attorney general's office, disarmed Acapulco municipal police officers and arrested two of them for their ""probable responsibility"" in homicide, they said in a joint statement. 
Acapulco's other police officers are under investigation, the group said, without specifying how many, adding that weapons, bulletproof vests, ammunition and radios were seized.
There were over 30,000 murders across Mexico last year, the highest in records going back to 1997, as rival drug gangs splintered into smaller, more bloodthirsty groups following more than a decade of a military-led campaign to battle the cartels.

Kabila has ruled since his father's assassination in 2001. He agreed last month not to defy term limits by running for re-election, opening the door to the Central African nation's first democratic transfer of power.
His announcement calmed tensions that have seen dozens of anti-Kabila demonstrators killed by security forces since he refused to step down when his constitutional mandate expired in December 2016.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales slammed a U.N. anti-corruption body on Tuesday, telling the United Nations General Assembly that the agency that has attempted to prosecute him was a ""threat to peace"" in the Central American nation.
Morales decided last month to not renew the mandate of the U.N.-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) and banned the body's head from setting foot in the country, on the grounds they violated laws and sowed ""judicial terror"" with ""selective justice.""
Morales was scheduled to meet with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday night, Guatemala's government said in a brief statement without providing further details.
The comedian turned politician dedicated more than half his speech at the United Nations to condemning the CICIG, accusing it of abuses of power, violations of human rights and politicizing justice in Guatemala.
    He also attempted to blame deaths on the CICIG, saying that it had caused fatalities by pressuring judges to deny five unidentified suspects in custody proper medical treatment.
""In essence, the CICIG has become a threat to peace in Guatemala. The CICIG has created a system of terror, a system wherein those who think differently are persecuted,"" he said.
    The ideals of the CICIG had been lost in U.N. bureaucracy and the ""cult of personality, which should never be greater than the institution it represents,"" Morales said.
CICIG head Ivan Velasquez, a hard-charging Colombian prosecutor, helped bring down and imprison Morales' predecessor as president. Working with Guatemala's attorney general, CICIG in 2017 also sought to prosecute Morales over illegal campaign financing allegations.
Morales' moves to dismantle CICIG have prompted what critics have labeled a ""constitutional crisis"" in Guatemala.
The nation's constitutional court issued a provisional ruling on Sept. 16 allowing Velasquez to return. But the government has nonetheless refused to let him return to Guatemala, asking the United Nations instead to name a new leader for the mission.
Morales repeated that request in New York in his speech.

The United Nations said on Sept. 19 that it would send an assistant director to lead CICIG as Velasquez remains banned.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A senior United Arab Emirates (UAE) official warned European powers on Tuesday that it was offering Iran a glimmer of hope by trying to keep trade flowing, but that ultimately they would fall behind the United States' tough approach on Tehran.
The UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain swiftly backed U.S. President Donald Trump's decision in May to withdraw from a 2015 international accord with Iran that curbed Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for loosening economic sanctions.
The Sunni Muslim-ruled states are at loggerheads with Shi’ite Iran, fighting a proxy war that has influenced conflicts in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.
UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash told Reuters at the United Nations General Assembly he was concerned by the public differences between the remaining European signatories to the accord - France, Britain and Germany - and the United States. All of them agree that Iran's long-term nuclear activities should be curbed, its ballistic missile program curbed and its regional influence reigned in.
""The faster we can bridge those opinions the better,"" Gargash said.
""The Iranians are counting on this and perhaps creating a wedge between Washington's approach and the European policy.""
U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani exchanged taunts at the annual gathering of world leaders on Tuesday with Trump vowing more sanctions against Tehran and Rouhani suggesting his American counterpart suffers from a ""weakness of intellect."" [nL2N1WB0UN]
The European powers with China and Russia are desperately trying to salvage the nuclear deal and on Monday said they had agreed to set up a special payment mechanism to continue trade with Iran in an effort to skirt U.S. sanctions. 
French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday the European efforts would not change the mind of companies that had already left Iran, but would try to provide some economic benefits to Tehran.
""Unfortunately the current disagreement over approach is not helpful and it is giving Iran a sort of lifeline and hope that it can skirt the various concerns that everyone has about Iran,"" Gargash said. 

He said he believed that Trump's pressure policy that will see tougher sanctions restored on Nov. 5 would yield results and that within a year Iran could be at the negotiating table.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump praised North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un on Tuesday for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still had to be done and sanctions must remain in place on North Korea until it denuclearizes.
""The missiles and rockets are no longer flying in every direction, nuclear testing has stopped, some military facilities are already being dismantled,"" Trump said in his speech to the annual United Nations General Assembly.
""I would like to thank Chairman Kim for his courage and for the steps he has taken, though much work remains to be done,"" Trump said. ""The sanctions will stay in place until denuclearization occurs.""
Trump's remarks on North Korea were dramatically different from those in his speech last year at the U.N. assembly, when he threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea and mocked the North Korean leader as ""Rocket Man"" on a ""suicide mission.""
Trump held an unprecedented summit with Kim in Singapore in June which yielded a broad pledge by Kim to ""work towards"" denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
However, Kim's commitments and actions so far have fallen far short of Washington's demands for a complete inventory of North Korea's weapons programs and irreversible steps to give up a nuclear arsenal that threatens the United States.
Trump has nevertheless heaped personal praise on Kim and expressed enthusiasm for a second summit.
On Monday, he said he expected this to be announced ""pretty soon"" but that the location had yet to be determined.
During a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the United Nations on Monday, Trump said Kim has been ""really very open and terrific, frankly.""
""I think he wants to see something happen.""
Trump singled out Japanese Prime Minster Shinzo Abe, Moon and Chinese President Xi Jinping for their support over North Korea, in spite of some questions about the commitment of the latter two leaders to maintaining tough sanctions on Pyongyang. 
At a meeting last week with Moon, Kim promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took ""corresponding action.""
Moon told an event in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. meeting that declaring a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War would encourage North Korea to move further with denuclearization.
Moon said Kim had told him the ""corresponding measures"" he was seeking were security guarantees Trump pledged in Singapore and moves toward normalization of relations with Washington.
""I believe that setting a timetable for all these measures is a task for the second U.S.-North Korea summit,"" Moon said.
Fox News said Moon told the network in an interview to be broadcast on Tuesday evening that Trump could meet Kim before the end of the year. Moon has said his administration aims to declare an end to the Korean War this year.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday he hoped to travel to North Korea again before the end of the year to make final preparations for a second Trump-Kim summit.
Pompeo has proposed a meeting with North Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho at the General Assembly this week. U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said last week the two had agreed to meet but that the meeting could take place later.
Ri, who responded to Trump's U.N. remarks last year by calling them ""the sound of a dog barking"" and warning that North Korea could detonate a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific, arrived back in New York on Tuesday afternoon.
He did not reply when asked on arrival at his hotel close to the United Nations when he would meet Pompeo. 
Moon and Abe met on the sidelines of the U.N. assembly and the South Korean leader highlighted the importance of improved relations between Tokyo and Pyongyang to accelerate North Korean denuclearization, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported. 

""I believe the normalization of North Korea-Japan relations is required in the process of establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula, and I will actively support and cooperate so a North Korea-Japan summit will be held,"" Yonhap quoted Moon as telling Abe.

Speaking at a conference, Bolton also said the United States would be ""aggressive and unwavering"" in enforcing economic sanctions on Iran that are resuming after Washington withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. He said the United States would not allow the European Union or anyone else to undermine them.
In a statement after a meeting of Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and Iran on Monday - the countries still in the deal, the group said they were determined to develop payment mechanisms to continue trade with Iran despite skepticism by many diplomats that this will be possible.
Bolton, however, was skeptical that the European Union could create a ""special purpose vehicle"" - described by diplomats as a sovereign barter channel much like one used by the Soviet Union during the Cold War - that would sustain Iran's oil sales.
""The European Union is strong on rhetoric and weak on follow-through,"" Bolton said. ""We will be watching the development of this structure that doesn't exist yet and has no target date to be created. We do not intend to allow our sanctions to be evaded by Europe or anybody else.""
Bolton also said the United States expected Iran's oil customers to slash their imports of Iranian crude to zero by Nov. 4 before U.S. sanctions kick back in on Nov. 5. U.S. officials have sent mixed signals on whether the oil purchases needed to be eliminated by then or simply significantly reduced.
""Banks and financial messaging services such as SWIFT must take a good hard look at their business with Iran and ask themselves whether it is worth the risk,"" Bolton said. ""SWIFT should follow the example of a growing number of businesses ... that reexamined their dealings with the Iranian regime.""

Iran was barred from SWIFT, the Belgium-based Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, in 2012, crippling its ability to make international bank transfers crucial to foreign trade. After the 2015 nuclear deal, it was reconnected, but European officials have said they expect the United States to apply pressure on SWIFT to once again cut Iran off.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Germany and Saudi Arabia agreed on Tuesday to enter a new phase in relations after a diplomatic dispute that had soured ties between the two countries.
The spat began in November when Germany's foreign minister at the time, Sigmar Gabriel, condemned ""adventurism"" in the Middle East, comments that were perceived by some as an attack on increasingly assertive Saudi policies. Arab forces, led Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are fighting Iran-aligned Houthis in Yemen's war.
Riyadh dismissed the Gabriel's comments as ""shameful"" and withdrew its ambassador to Germany. German exports to Saudi Arabia fell 5 percent in the first half of 2018. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been trying to ease tensions, speaking to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman by telephone.
""In recent months, our relations have witnessed a misunderstanding which stand in sharp contrast to our otherwise strong and strategic ties with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and we sincerely regret this,"" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said alongside his Saudi counterpart, Adel al-Jubeir, at the United Nations, where leaders are gathered for the annual General Assembly.
""We should have been clearer in our communication and engagement in order to avoid such misunderstandings between Germany and the kingdom,"" he said. 
Jubeir said he welcomed Maas' statement and invited him to the kingdom to intensify their ties.
Earlier this month, Germany approved a delivery of weapons to Saudi Arabia, a government document showed, after saying it would halt arms sales to countries involved in the war in Yemen.
Last month, European and U.S. pharmaceutical associations waded into the diplomatic dispute, warning that restrictions on German-made drugs could hurt Saudi patients and dampen future investment in the kingdom.
""We'll do our best to make this partnership with the Kingdom even stronger than before,"" Maas said.
The dispute was reminiscent of one that erupted between Canada and Saudi Arabia, which was triggered by a post on twitter by the Canadian foreign minister calling for the release of human rights activists in Saudi Arabia.

The kingdom responded by expelling the Canadian ambassador, recalling its own envoy, freezing new trade and investment, suspending flights and ordering Saudi students to leave Canada.

NORRISTOWN, Pa. (Reuters) - Bill Cosby was marched out of court in shackles on Tuesday after a judge branded him a ""predator"" and sentenced him to between three and 10 years in prison for sexual assault, capping the downfall of the once-beloved comedian known as ""America's Dad.""
Cosby, 81, was found guilty in April of three counts of aggravated indecent assault for the drugging and sexual assault of his one-time friend Andrea Constand, a former Temple University administrator, at his Philadelphia home in 2004.
He is the first celebrity to be convicted of sexual abuse since the start of the #MeToo movement, the national reckoning with misconduct that has brought down dozens of powerful men in entertainment, politics and other fields.
Cosby must spend at least three years in a Pennsylvania prison before he becomes eligible for supervised release, though he could end up behind bars for up to a decade.
Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas Judge Steven O'Neill ordered Cosby to be jailed immediately, denying Cosby's request for bail while lawyers appeal the conviction. 
He was escorted out a back door of the courthouse with his hands and feet shackled and driven away in a black sport utility vehicle.
Minutes earlier, Constand left court with her arms folded, a smile spreading across her face as other women who have accused Cosby came to hug her. Several of those women spoke to reporters in the rain outside the courtroom. 
""I wanted 30 years, but I'm very happy to know Mr. Cosby will do time in prison,"" said Chelan Lasha, who gave tearful testimony in court about the time she says Cosby drugged and groped her in the 1980s.
O'Neill also fined Cosby $25,000 and ordered him to pay the costs of the prosecution. There was no visible reaction from the disgraced entertainer as he learned his fate.
""Equal justice under the law does not allow different treatment because of who he is or who he was,"" O'Neill said.
Cosby cemented his family-friendly reputation playing the affable Dr. Cliff Huxtable in the 1980s television comedy ""The Cosby Show.""
""He hid behind Dr. Cliff Huxtable,"" Kevin Steele, the county district attorney who led the prosecution, told reporters afterwards. ""Before he was taken away in handcuffs, a lot of people believed this was who he was. We know otherwise.""
After the sentencing, Andrew Wyatt, Cosby's spokesman, read a lengthy statement in which he decried what he called ""the most racist and sexist trial in the history of the United States.""
SEXUALLY VIOLENT PREDATORY
O'Neill also decided to designate Cosby a ""sexually violent predator"" under Pennsylvania law. 
Under that designation, Cosby will have to undergo monthly counseling and register as a sex offender with police for the rest of his life. Neighbors and schools will be notified of his address, certain movements and crimes, as will Constand. 
When prosecutors told Cosby in court he would not have to inform Constand of his movements himself but that a proxy would do so, he replied: ""Good!""
Cosby has denied any wrongdoing. Asked if he wanted to address the court with a statement before sentencing, Cosby declined through his lawyers. His lawyers had asked that Cosby be placed under house arrest, citing his age and frailty.
More than 50 women have accused Cosby of sexual abuse going back decades, with most complaints too old to prosecute. The Constand case was the only allegation that led to criminal charges.
Constand said in a written statement submitted to the court on Monday that the attack had turned her into a woman who was ""stuck in a holding pattern for most of her adult life, unable to heal fully or to move forward.""
""Bill Cosby took my beautiful, healthy young spirit and crushed it,"" she wrote.
Cosby's first trial in 2017 ended in a mistrial when jurors could not reach a unanimous verdict. 
Prison officials will process Cosby at the nearby state prison in Schwenksville before determining in which of Pennsylvania's 22 male prisons he will serve his sentence, prison spokeswoman Amy Worden wrote in an email.

He will be one of 86 inmates over age 80 held by Pennsylvania’s Department of Corrections, where the two oldest inmates are both 91, Worden said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon's nominee to be the next commander of U.S. forces in South Korea said on Tuesday that a decision to suspend some joint exercises between South Korea and the United States was a ""prudent risk"" but had caused a ""slight degradation"" in military readiness.
President Donald Trump caught many U.S. officials off guard earlier this year when he announced after an unprecedented summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that the United States was suspending the summer’s joint military drills with South Korea. 
""The suspension of the exercise this past August and September, I would say was prudent risk if we're willing to make the effort to change the relationship with the DPRK,"" U.S. Army General Robert Abrams said, using the acronym for North Korea’s official name, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.
""I think there was certainly degradation to the readiness of the force,"" Abrams said during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. He added that he was confident that a plan was in place to sustain readiness, including by carrying out exercises that were smaller in scope. 
The suspension of the exercises was criticized in the United States as a premature concession to North Korea, which has resisted U.S. efforts to persuade it to give up its nuclear weapons.
Trump repeatedly touted the cost savings that would ensue from his decision to stop ""the war games.""
One of the major exercises suspended by Trump was Freedom Guardian, which according to the U.S. military would have cost around $14 million.
Trump recently said there was no reason to resume drills with South Korea.
Abrams said planning for military exercises scheduled for spring 2019 continued and the decision to go ahead with them rested with the leaders. He said it was unclear how many more major exercises could be skipped without a significant reduction in readiness.
Abrams also said North Korea still had significant capabilities and the United States should remain ""clear-eyed"" about the ""significant asymmetric and intercontinental threat"" from North Korea, Abrams said.
The United States has around 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea, which North Korea has long demanded be removed.
Abrams said removing U.S. troops from the Korean peninsula would create a major tactical risk. 
Separately, U.S. Defense Secretary Mattis said on Tuesday that North Korea was still an ""urgent"" nuclear threat.

""In terms of urgency, I would say it is North Korea,"" Mattis said when asked what the greatest threats against the United States were.

""Unfortunately, just last night I was disturbed and indeed deeply disappointed to hear remaining parties in the Iran (nuclear) deal announce they are setting up a special payment system to bypass U.S. sanctions.

""This amendment will enable the (National Anti-Corruption) Commission and competent authorities to carry out their tasks effectively and efficiently to protect public money, the state's interests and the national economy from corruption,"" the commission's chairman, Khalid bin Abdul Mohsen Al-Muhaisen, was quoted as saying by state news agency SPA.
Authorities rounded up dozens of princes, top officials and businessmen last November on Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s orders, with many confined and interrogated at Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton Hotel.
Most detainees, including global investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, were released after being exonerated or reaching financial settlements with the government, which says it arranged to seize more than $100 billion through such deals.
The corruption sweep alarmed the Saudi business community as well as international investors the country is courting to support Prince Mohammed's efforts to transform an oil-dependent economy.
But the campaign remains shrouded in secrecy, with few details of the allegations or the financial settlements disclosed. The Ritz reopened to the public in February, though 56 people who had not reached settlements by then were kept in custody and could face trial.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - After losing his job with a foreign food company in March, Alexander Costa surveyed Brazil's anemic labor market and decided to start selling cheap lunches by the beach in Rio de Janeiro to try and provide for his young family.
""I could have stayed home, looking for work, sending out resumes, with few jobs and things very hard,"" Costa said. ""But I didn't stand still. I decided to create something different ... to reinvent myself.""
Many other Brazilians have also had to reinvent themselves in recent years, as Latin America's largest economy struggles to overcome a jobs crisis more than a year after officially exiting recession.
Nearly 13 million people - or more than the entire population of Greece - are out of a job, with the unemployment rate hovering between 12 percent to 14 percent since 2016. As a result, unemployment is among voters' top concerns ahead of next month's election.
The desperate search for work amid a string of political graft scandals and rising violence has soured the mood, polarizing debate and distracting from the country's underlying fiscal challenges.
But only by lowering the unemployment rate will Brazil achieve the rise in household spending it needs to maintain sustained growth, said Marcos Casarin, the head of Latin America macro research at Oxford Economics.
""The only way to have a prolonged recovery in economic activity is if unemployment starts to fall in a substantial way,"" he said.
However, it could take several years to get the rate below 10 percent, he said, adding: ""I'm not very optimistic."" 
DIVISIVE FIGURES 
With no presidential candidate likely to win a majority in the first-round vote on Oct. 7, it looks increasingly likely voters will face a choice between two candidates in the Oct. 28 run-off: far-right Jair Bolsonaro and leftist Fernando Haddad of the Workers Party. [nL2N1WA1PX]
Both are divisive figures — rejected by nearly half the electorate — making it likely that either one will face an uphill battle to pass ambitious economic reforms that foreign investors have long called for.
Bolsonaro has vowed to erase Brazil's primary budget deficit by 2020 through controversial privatizations and spending cuts.
Haddad has proposed broadening the central bank's mandate to include unemployment, while boosting government-led investments, revoking a spending ceiling and scuttling privatizations.
Both Bolsonaro and Haddad are pitching their proposals as ways to tackle the unemployment crisis, which has pushed many into the informal sector, sapping tax income and leaving workers without paid holidays, salary raises and other benefits. 
Outgoing President Michel Temer last year passed an overhaul of the country's labor laws, which was intended to make the job market more flexible and which the government said would help create new jobs, an effect that as yet has failed to materialize.
Bolsonaro supports Temer's labor reform and wants to further cut work regulations to boost jobs. Haddad has suggested putting the labor reform, which was opposed by unions, to a referendum, while also advocating a short-term stimulus program. 
Costa, however, was unwilling to wait and see what Brazil's next president comes up with. 
His meals-on-wheels business started slowly, selling 13-reais ($3) lunches from the back of his car in Rio's wealthy Barra da Tijuca neighborhood. But business took off when he joined forces with his friend, Stefan Weiss, whose white BMW provides a ritzier shop window from which they now sell roughly 200 hot meals each day. 

""At the moment, Brazil faces a big problem in relation to the economy and the lack of jobs,"" said Weiss, who works on an offshore oil platform but sells meals on days off to earn extra cash. ""The people who lost their jobs are trying to find new ways to establish themselves in the market.""

Valls was born in Barcelona in 1962 to a Catalan father and Swiss-Italian mother but raised in France. He has spent all his political career in France - as a mayor, a member of the National Assembly, a minister and the head of the government.
Following his failed run for French president, he has spent a growing part of his time in Spain, where he has been campaigning against Catalonia's secession drive.
Valls, who was French prime minister under former Socialist President Francis Hollande, said in a speech, delivered in Catalan, Spanish and French on Tuesday, that he would run in Barcelona on an independent platform.
Center-right party Ciudadanos, which won a regional election in Catalonia last year and has been leading the anti-secession movement, had previously said they would back Valls.
A GAD3 opinion poll published in June showed Ciudadanos was expected to win only 10 seats in the 41-strong city council in Barcelona's next election, due in May 2019.
It is not clear what the chances are for Valls to secure the backing of other groups and, if he did, whether this would be enough to reach a majority and be elected mayor.
Valls did not say whether losing the election would spell the end of his political career, though he said he would abandon all political mandates in France so that he can fully focus on the Barcelona vote.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday criticized Washington for its hostile policy toward his country and said the U.S. approach was doomed to failure.
Rouhani, in a speech to the United Nation General Assembly, said the United States had waged ""economic war"" against Iran by reimposing unilateral sanctions, which were lifted under the country's 2015 multinational nuclear deal in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear work.
""The United States policy vis-à-vis the Islamic Republic of Iran has been wrong from the beginning, and its approach of resisting the wishes of the Iranian people as manifested in numerous elections is doomed to failure,"" Rouhani said.
President Donald Trump pulled the United States from the pact in May and his administration reimposed sanctions on Iran in August. Harsher sanctions on Iran's oil and banking sector are expected in November.
""The economic war that the United States has initiated under the rubric of new sanctions not only targets the Iranian people but also entails harmful repercussions for the people of other countries, and that war has caused a disruption in the state of global trade,"" Rouhani said.   
""What Iran says is clear: no war, no sanctions, no threats, no bullying; just acting according to the law and the fulfillment of obligations.""
Mounting pressure from the Trump administration combined with discontent among many Iranians at the state of the economy are rattling the Islamic Republic, with little sign that its leaders have the answers, officials and analysts say.
The rial has lost 40 per cent of its value against the U.S. dollar  since April and Iran has blamed U.S. sanctions for the currency's fall, saying the measures amount to a “political, psychological and economic” war on Tehran. 
To pile on the pain, Washington says all countries must end crude imports from Iran by Nov. 4, hitting the oil sales that generate 60 percent of the country’s income. Iran says this level of cuts will never happen.
Trump, in his annual U.N. speech, said he would keep up economic pressure on Tehran to try to force a change in its behavior. But Rouhani said Iran had no intention of succumbing to the U.S. pressure.
""The United States’ understanding of international relations is authoritarian ... Its understanding of power, not of legal and legitimate authority, is reflected in bullying and imposition,"" Rouhani said.
""No state and nation can be brought to the negotiating table by force.""
Rouhani also said Iran believed in setting up a collective mechanism for the Persian Gulf with the presence and participation of all regional countries.

Iran and U.S.-backed Saudi Arabia are involved in proxy conflicts across the region, from Syria to Lebanon.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Pyotr Verzilov, an anti-Kremlin activist being treated in a Berlin hospital for suspected poisoning, has been given a police guard for his own protection, a close friend who visited him in hospital said on Tuesday.
Verzilov, publisher of a Russian online news portal with close ties to punk protest group Pussy Riot, fell ill suddenly two weeks ago, losing his sight, hearing and the ability to walk. 
German doctors have not found any traces of poison in his body though they say there is no other explanation for his condition. Verzilov, in a tweet from hospital on Tuesday, said he had been stricken by ""wonderful poisons ... something new and surprising.""
Hunter Heaney, a close friend who visited Verzilov in Berlin's Charite hospital, said he noticed he was being followed by two unknown people near his home and close to the hospital.
He was worried about his safety and called the German police. The police responded by putting Verzilov, his family members and Heaney under police guard for their protection.
""We are very definitely under police protection all the time,"" he told Reuters by phone from Berlin. 
A spokesman for Berlin police said they were in contact with Verzilov and his entourage and the situation was constantly being assessed. ""We ask for your understanding that we do not comment on possible measures in detail,"" the spokesman said.
Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, a Pussy Riot member who was previously in a relationship with Verzilov and has a child from their relationship, visited him in Berlin and returned to Moscow only on Sunday.
She told Reuters in Moscow that his condition had improved and he could be discharged from hospital in a few days. She said, though, that he was still suffering from bouts of delirium and his pupils had dilated.
Nika Nikulshina, with whom Verzilov is currently in a relationship, told Reuters: ""Forecasts are good although Petya (Verzilov) is not yet stable.""
Earlier, a Berlin doctor said Verzilov was likely poisoned as there was no other explanation so far as to why Verzilov was in such a condition. However, no official evidence of poisoning has been found in his body, according to Tolokonnikova.
    Verzilov was one of four Pussy Riot activists who ran onto the pitch during the soccer World Cup final in Moscow in July to protest police brutality. When he fell ill, he was treated in a Russian hospital for four days before being flown to Berlin for further care.
Tolokonnikova said Russian doctors concluded he was not poisoned, and diagnosed him with psyschological problems. She said that, despite that diagnosis, the doctors had pumped his stomach and carried out liver dialysis.
In a Twitter post on Tuesday, Verzilov said ""I've been relatively conscious now only for the past three days, and before that it was like being in a black hole.""
He added: ""I am spending my days in the friendly company of wonderful poisons. But not polonium 210 or Novichok, but something new and surprising.""
Polonium is the radioactive isotope that poisoned former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006. He later died, and British police alleged he was the victim of a Russian  state-sponsored plot, an allegation denied by Moscow.

British officials identified Novichok, a Soviet-developed nerve agent, as the substance which last year poisoned former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter. They survived. Russian has denied any involvement.

564,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",Congolese activists convicted of inciting anti-Kabila protests,"KINSHASA (Reuters) - A Congolese court on Tuesday sentenced four pro-democracy activists to a year in prison for inciting protests against President Joseph Kabila, their lawyer said. 
Kabila maintains a tight grip on the Democratic Republic of Congo despite his announcement in August that he will not defy constitutional term limits to seek a third term in elections due in December.
That decision calmed tensions that have roiled the country since he refused to step down when his mandate expired in 2016. But his opponents remain skeptical that the vote will be free and fair. 
The activists were arrested on Dec. 30 as they mobilized residents of the capital Kinshasa to demonstrate against Kabila's refusal to quit power. Security forces have killed dozens of people in similar protests over the last two years. 
Carbone Beni, Grace Tshiunza, Mino Bopomi and Cedric Kayembe were convicted of incitation to civil disobedience, their lawyer Jacquemain Shabani told Reuters.
Beni is a coordinator of Filimbi, a youth movement whose members have been repeatedly detained by the security services. 
Shabani said his clients would appeal their sentences, and should be released by Dec. 30 at the latest on account of time already served.
A fifth accused activist, Palmer Kabeya, was acquitted by the court. 
Shabani and rights groups say Beni was badly beaten during his arrest and that he and the others were illegally held by the intelligence services without access to lawyers.
Government spokesman Lambert Mende said on Tuesday the activists should file a complaint with the prosecutor's office if they had suffered abuse. 
The United Nations has repeatedly criticized Congolese authorities for suppressing freedom of speech and using violence against peaceful protesters.
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet warned earlier this month that widespread human rights violations by the government ""endanger the credibility of the electoral process"".
The government has dismissed those charges and accused the United Nations and foreign governments of interfering in its sovereign affairs.

565,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 01:54PM ET</span>","At U.N., Trump rejects globalism and blasts Iran","By Steve Holland and Jeff Mason
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump used his annual address to the United Nations on Tuesday to attack Iran's ""corrupt dictatorship,"" praise last year's bogeyman North Korea and lay down a defiant message that he will reject globalism and protect American interests.
""We will never surrender America's sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable, global bureaucracy,"" Trump said, in language popular with his political base. ""America is governed by Americans. We reject the ideology of globalism, and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism.""
Trump's 35-minute address was met largely by silence from world leaders still not comfortable with go-it-alone views that have strained U.S. relationships with traditional allies worldwide.
His speech, while delivered in a low-key fashion, was nonetheless a thunderous recitation of his ""America First"" policies. He has disrupted the world order by withdrawing the United States from the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord, and threatened to punish NATO nations for not paying more for their common defense.
""Moving forward, we are only going to give foreign aid to those who respect us and, frankly, are our friends. And we expect other countries to pay their fair share for the cost of their defense,"" he said.
Besides calling out Iran, Trump also criticized China for its trade practices but made no mention of Russia's interference in Syria's war or its suspected meddling in U.S. elections.
MACRON'S ALTERNATIVE VIEW
Offering an alternative view when it was his turn at the podium, French President Emmanuel Macron told the delegates that the law of the survival of the fittest, protectionism and isolationism would only lead to heightened tensions.
    Defending multilateralism and collective action, he warned that nationalism would lead to failure and if countries stopped defending basic principles, global wars would return.  
    ""I do not accept the erosion of multilateralism and don't accept our history unraveling,"" Macron told the assembly at times raising his voice. ""Our children are watching."" 
Trump aimed much of his remarks squarely at Iran and its ""corrupt dictatorship,"" which the United States accuses of harboring nuclear ambitions and fomenting instability in the Middle East through its support for militant groups in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.
""Iran's leaders sow chaos, death and destruction,"" Trump told the gathering in the green-marbled hall. ""They do not respect their neighbors or borders or the sovereign rights of nations.""
Macron, citing the example of Iran, which minutes earlier Trump had called on the world to isolate, Macron said that this unilateralism push would lead directly to conflicts.
Trump, who begins his political rallies with boasts about his economic record in less than two years in office, used the same rhetoric before the crowd of world leaders and diplomats, telling them he had accomplished more than almost any previous U.S. president.
The remark led to some murmuring and laughter in the crowd, taking the president slightly aback.
""I didn’t expect that reaction, but that's OK,"" he said.
REJECTS MEETING ROUHANI
Trump, who said in a Twitter post on Tuesday morning that he had given up hope for a meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani while both were in New York, said he would keep up economic pressure on Tehran to try to force a change in its behavior. Rouhani is due to address leaders later on Tuesday.
In May, Republican Trump withdrew the United States from the 2015 international deal to put curbs on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for easing sanctions. Foes for decades, Washington and Tehran have been increasingly at odds since May. The accord with OPEC member Iran was negotiated under Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama.
""Additional sanctions will resume November 5th and more will follow and we are working with countries that import Iranian crude oil to cut their purchases substantially,"" Trump said.
He said the United States would help create a regional strategic alliance between Gulf nations and Jordan and Egypt, an initiative that the United States sees as a bulwark against Iran.
Trump compared U.S. relations with Iran to what he called improved ties with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who Trump had met in Singapore in June as part of a still-unfulfilled drive to get Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons.
In his address last year to the U.N., Trump insulted Kim as a ""rocket man"" bent on nuclear destruction. On Tuesday, Trump praised Kim for halting nuclear and missile tests, releasing Americans held prisoner and returning some remains of U.S. soldiers killed in the 1950s Korean War.
The two leaders are trying to arrange a second summit and are exchanging private correspondence. Trump has said sanctions on North Korea would remain for now.
Delivering a harsh message to OPEC members, Trump called on them to stop raising oil prices and to pay for their own military protection. He threatened to limit U.S. aid only to countries that are friendly to the United States.
A Gulf diplomat said in response that ""we have been doing our fair share of burden sharing.""
Crude oil prices shot to a four-year high on Tuesday, catapulted by imminent U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude exports and the apparent reluctance of OPEC and Russia to raise output to offset the potential hit to global supply.
Trump's main message was aimed at Iran and attempting to drive a wedge between its leadership and its people, days after an attack in southwestern Iran on a military parade killed 25 people and unsettled the country.
In remarks to reporters on his way to his speech, Trump said he would not meet the Iranians until they ""change their tune."" He held out the possibility of a better relationship in the future. 
Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for Iran's U.N. mission, told Reuters that Iran has not requested a meeting with Trump.

Some Iranian insiders have said any talks between Rouhani and Trump would effectively kill the existing nuclear accord, which France, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union also signed with Iran.

566,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 01:51PM ET</span>",Germany's Merkel suffers blow as ally Kauder loses senior party job,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel suffered an unexpected blow to her authority on Tuesday when her conservatives cast out long-standing ally Volker Kauder as head of the parliamentary party, reflecting rising discontent with her 13-year-old leadership.
The upset, described variously as a ""political thunderbolt"" and ""the beginning of the end of the Merkel era"" by opposition leaders, was widely taken as a sign that lawmakers want more say in shaping the policies of her fourth and final government.
The victory of Ralph Brinkhaus, a deputy leader of the conservative group in the Bundestag (lower house), marks a turning point since Kauder had accompanied Merkel, serving in effect as her parliamentary right hand, throughout her 13 years in office.
""You could call it Merkel-Daemmerung (Twilight),"" said Alexander Gauland, leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which entered the Bundestag for the first time after last year's election and now ranks second in polls. ""It's a further step toward the end of the Merkel government, which I believe will end far sooner than we can imagine today.""
Merkel, whose stewardship of Europe's largest economy shaped the 2008 euro zone crisis, the 2015 refugee crisis and the continent's reaction to the United States' unilateral turn under Donald Trump, congratulated Brinkhaus in a terse statement.
""I hoped Kauder could remain group leader because I worked well with him. But Brinkhaus got the most votes. I congratulated him and offered him good cooperation,"" she told reporters.
Though Brinkhaus, 50, scored a relatively narrow 125-112 victory over Kauder, 69, in the conservative group - comprising Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU), the upset was a clear sign of lawmakers' growing disenchantment with Merkel's ruling style.
""The conservative group wants more of a say and more government work,"" said senior CDU lawmaker Hans Michelbach. ""Brinkhaus said we don't need to be calm, but to act.""
""MUCH WORK TO DO""
An instinctive centrist, Merkel has often seemed most comfortable working with parties well to her left, including the Social Democrats (SPD), with whom she currently governs, or the Greens.
That has often run against the instincts of her own Bundestag deputies, and it was Kauder's job, as a link between party leadership and increasingly restive lawmakers, to soothe and cajole them into backing the chancellor.
""I am very pleased by the result of the vote, we have a lot of work to do,"" said Brinkhaus, adding he had great respect for Kauder's achievements.
Kauder's toppling comes after a turbulent few weeks during which coalition partners rowed over the fate of the head of Germany's security service, who had questioned reports of far-right attacks on migrants.
Merkel's decision to let over a million refugees into Germany at the height of the 2015 migrant crisis was applauded by many to her left, but many of her fellow conservatives were uneasy, fearing a backlash that would boost the far right.
Brinkhaus announced his candidacy a few weeks ago, surprising many commentators who viewed the move as something of a challenge to one of Merkel's closest allies, but he was widely expected to lose.
""It's a political thunderbolt for Berlin,"" said Christian Lindner, leader of the pro-business Free Democrats, who interpreted the vote as a sign that lawmakers were no longer content with Merkel policies that were ""interchangeable with those of the Greens'.

""We greet this emancipation,"" he added.

ROCKY FLATS, Colo. (Reuters) - Less than two miles (3 km) from where triggers for thermonuclear weapons were once manufactured and against the backdrop of Colorado's Rocky Mountains, a bull elk bugles as he defends his harem of cows from rival males. 
""It's rutting season and this is mating behavior,"" said David Lucas of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, and manager of Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge, 12 miles (19 km) northwest of Denver. 
He was escorting a Reuters journalist on one of the first official tours of the 5,237-acre (2,119-hectare )Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge since it opened on Sept 15. 
The unique prairie ecosystem, is home to 239 wildlife species, ranging from elk and mule deer to black bears, cougars, numerous bird species, and monarch butterflies, Lucas said.
It's unclear how long the refuge will remain open.
Five environmental and community activist groups have sued the government, arguing the Rocky Flats refuge should be closed until more testing is done. A judge last month rejected their request to delay the opening while the lawsuit is heard. 
The suit is pending in Denver federal court. 
The Rocky Flats plutonium plant had a history of fires, and radioactive spills during its 37 years in operation before shutting down permanently in 1989 during a criminal investigation into environmental violations. 
Now that it's a refuge, its 10.2 miles (16.4 km) of trails are open to naturalists, hikers, cyclists and equestrians. About 1,300 acres (526 hectares) immediately surrounding the old production facility is permanently closed off to the public. 
Because the weapons production was a classified defense operation, no development was allowed on the site so the area has been untouched by human encroachment, leaving it in pristine condition, Lucas said.
REMNANT PLUTONIUM
In the lawsuit, pending before U.S. District Judge Philip Brimmer, opponents of the refuge argue that a $7.7 billion Superfund cleanup overseen by the Environmental Protection Agency was flawed and a new environmental study should be conducted.
""Our case will clearly demonstrate that the government does not have an up-to-date assessment of risks to the environment and human health from allowing unlimited public visits to the refuge,"" Randall Weiner, an attorney for the coalition, told Reuters.
Human activity could stir up remnant plutonium, which if ingested by refuge visitors or residents downwind can cause cancer, Weiner said.
Both the EPA and Colorado health officials have determined that the site is safe and background radiation is within acceptable limits.
""This is one of the most studied pieces of land on the planet,"" said Lindsay Masters, an environmental protection specialist with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, noting that several studies of the soil, water and air have found that the site is not a public health hazard.
Rocky Flat's demise began in 1989, when FBI agents and EPA investigators raided the plant based on a whistleblower's tip that contractors were illegally disposing of hazardous materials. 
The contractor at the time, Rockwell International Corp., pleaded guilty to violating environmental laws and paid $18.5 million in fines. In 2015, Rockwell and the plant's previous contractor,  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) Co., paid $375 million to 12,000 homeowners downwind from the plant after a federal jury found the companies were liable for devaluing their properties due to plutonium releases.

It is unknown when Judge Brimmer will rule on the current lawsuit, but it may not end the controversy. The losing party could appeal and a lawsuit filed by the nearby town of Superior seeking to close the refuge is in its early stages.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that his country could not remain silent over the use of sanctions as weapons while it is in a bitter standoff with the United States over the fate of an American evangelical Christian pastor detained by Ankara.
The United States has called for the release of pastor Andrew Brunson, who was moved to house arrest in July after being detained for 21 months. If found guilty, he could be jailed for up to 35 years. He denies the charges.
Turkey says the United States should respect the legal process for the pastor, whose trial in Turkey on terrorism charges has infuriated U.S. President Donald Trump. 
""None of us can remain silent to the arbitrary cancellation of commercial agreements and the use of economic sanctions as weapons,"" Erdogan said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly.
In August, Trump authorized a doubling of duties on aluminum and steel imported from Turkey. Turkey responded in kind, raising tariffs on U.S. cars, alcohol and tobacco imports. 
The lira has lost nearly 40 percent of its value against the dollar this year on concerns about Erdogan’s grip on monetary policy and the diplomatic dispute between Ankara and Washington.
The Trump administration has also imposed sanctions on two top officials in Erdogan’s cabinet as part of its efforts to pressure Turkey into freeing Brunson.
""Today, some countries are persistently trying to create chaos. We are in favor of solving our problems through conducting a constructive dialogue on equal terms,"" Erdogan said.
However, the Turkish Lira firmed slightly on Tuesday as investors weighed up the prospect of an improvement in Turkey-U.S. ties after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he expected talks this week over Brunson's fate.
Erdogan's communication adviser Fahrettin Altun posted on Twitter a picture of Erdogan and Trump shaking hands and smiling at the United Nations. 
Ankara and Washington are also at odds over diverging interests in Syria, where Washington supports Kurdish rebels whom Turkey regards as terrorists. 
""Those who equip terrorists with tens of thousands of trucks and thousands of cargo planes loaded with arms for the sake of their tactical interests will most definitely feel sorrow in the future,"" Erdogan said.

Washington has expressed concern that NATO member Turkey’s planned deployment of the Russian-made S-400 could risk the security of some U.S.-made weapons and other technology used by Turkey, including the F-35 jet.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May signaled on Tuesday that she would prefer a 'no-deal' Brexit to the offer currently put forward by the European Union, stressing that Britain needs to see counter-proposals from the EU to move Brexit negotiations forward.
May last week issued an angry edict to Brussels when a summit of EU leaders which had been billed as a chance to generate momentum toward a deal in October or November ended in a blunt dismissal of British proposals.
""I've always said no deal is better than a bad deal,"" May told reporters. ""I think a bad deal would be a deal that broke up the United Kingdom,"" May said when asked whether a no-deal Brexit was better than one similar to the existing Canada-EU trade deal.
Her spokesman said later that May was specifically referring to the type of deal the EU is currently offering on future trade, which Britain believes will split England, Wales and Scotland from Northern Ireland by insisting Northern Ireland adhere to different customs rules.
Her position also effectively rules out alternative Brexit proposals put forward by rebel eurosceptic members of her own party, which are based on a wide-ranging free trade agreement similar to that agreed between the EU and Canada.
Speaking to reporters on her way to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly, May said she welcomed comments from European Council President Donald Tusk that the bloc still wanted to strike a deal, but added that the onus was still on the EU to break the deadlock on Chequers.
""If they have concerns, they need to detail those concerns to us and if they have counter-proposals, let's hear the counter proposals and then we can discuss those,"" she said.
May said the opposition Labour Party's Brexit plans were not in the national interest after Labour's Brexit policy chief said the party was likely to vote against any deal she reaches with the European Union.
Even if May is able to secure a deal on Brexit with Brussels, it is far from certain she will be able to get the terms approved by parliament. In addition to Labour lawmakers, many in her own party also disagree with her exit plans.
If she loses a vote, May has said Britain will leave the EU without a deal. But, in the likely chaos around a parliamentary defeat she could also face a leadership challenge, calls for a new national election, and even a second Brexit referendum.

""I still do believe that we can get a good deal ... at that point all members of parliament will have a clear choice,"" she said. ""They’ll have to recognize, looking at their vote, that what we’re doing is delivering on the vote of the referendum, delivering on the vote of the British people.""

""Saudi Arabia rejects and condemns the false accusations that Iranian officials have made about Saudi Arabia supporting the events that took place in Iran last Saturday,"" SPA quoted a foreign ministry official as saying.
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday that the attackers were paid by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and pledged that the Islamic Republic would ""severely punish"" those behind the assault.
The deputy head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards also accused the United States and Israel of involvement and said they should expect a devastating response.
Arch-rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran, both oil super-powers, are waging a war for influence across the Middle East, backing opposite sides in conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon.
On Saturday, gunmen fired on a viewing stand in Ahvaz where officials had gathered to watch an annual parade marking the start of Iran's 1980-88 war with Iraq.
Ahvaz National Resistance, an Iranian ethnic Arab opposition movement which seeks a separate state in oil-rich Khuzestan province, and Islamic State have both claimed responsibility, without giving evidence.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Monday dismissed Tehran's threats, and a senior UAE official had previously denied the accusations.
Separately, the semi-official Iranian news agency Fars posted a video on Tuesday threatening that Iran might carry out missile strikes on Israel and Saudi Arabia.

The original footage showed Jerusalem and the Saudi capital Riyadh as being targeted, but Fars soon deleted that video and posted a new version with the cities' names not shown.

Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) and its European partners are developing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, designed to double natural gas volumes pumped from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea, avoiding traditional transit route Ukraine.
""Reliance on a single foreign supplier can leave nations vulnerable to extortion and intimidation and that is why we congratulate European states such as Poland for leading construction of a Baltic pipeline so that nations are not dependent on Russia to meet their energy needs,"" Trump told the United Nations General Assembly.
""Germany will become totally dependent on Russian energy if it does not immediately change course.""
Most eastern Europe states and the United States argue the proposed pipeline could ultimately limit supply routes and the energy security of the European Union, as well as hurting Ukraine's efforts to reform its economy as bypassing the country would deprive it of billions of dollars in gas transit fees.

While Berlin and Moscow have been at loggerheads since Russia's annexation of Crimea four years ago, they share a common interest in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project.

574,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 10:41AM ET</span>",Israel opens high-speed rail link between Tel Aviv airport and Jerusalem,"By Ori Lewis
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel opened a high-speed rail link between Tel Aviv's international airport and Jerusalem on Tuesday, part of a $2 billion project that has drawn Palestinian complaints over its route through small parts of the occupied West Bank.
The train will cut travel time between Ben-Gurion Airport and a new, 80-metre-(260-foot)-deep underground terminal at the entrance to Jerusalem to around 20 minutes. By road, the trip takes at least 40 minutes.
At the airport, the bright red train drew smiles from eager passengers.
""It was like a dream come true ... It's really quite amazing
and will be a valuable asset to people wanting to get to and from the airport,"" said Manchester-born Eli Rothbard, 45, a ground services employee at Ben Gurion.
The train, traveling at speeds of up to 160 kilometers per hour (100 mph), traverses a series of new tunnels and bridges, passing through hills between Jerusalem and the airport, about 40 km (25 miles) away.
The line runs through sections of land Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war near the Palestinian village of Beit Surik, on the outskirts of Jerusalem, and in the Latrun Valley, about midway between the holy city and Ben-Gurion airport.
Palestinians who live in the West Bank are largely barred by Israel from traveling abroad via Ben-Gurion, and cross overland to Jordan instead to fly out of the airport in Amman. Israel cites security concerns for the ban.
""It is very sad that you see a railway and see modern technology on your land and inside your land and you cannot use it or exploit it because of the element of power of the occupation,"" said Mohammed al-Tari, 55, from Beit Surik.
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat accused Israel of ""illegally making use of occupied Palestinian land"" in setting the train's route, which will eventually include a direct high-speed link between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv city itself.
Erekat said the train was part of Israel's ""agenda of turning its occupation into annexation"".
On a test run last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the opening of the line was ""an historic moment"" heralding a ""new era for Jerusalem and the state of Israel.""
There have been plans for a fast train between Jerusalem and the city of Tel Aviv, Israel's commercial hub on the Mediterranean coast, since 1995. But the project - infrastructure work began in 2005 - has been slow-moving, plagued by a lack of funding and environmental concerns.
Completion of electrification work and the opening of the 60-km (37-mile)-long route between the two cities has been frequently postponed. No firm inaugural date has been announced.
When completed, the train journey time between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem will take under half an hour. The drive takes at least an hour. An existing rail line built by the Ottoman Turks more than 100 years ago meanders around picturesque hills and the journey takes more than 90 minutes.

At Ben-Gurion, Yogev Yair, a 41-year-old high-tech employee traveling with his toddler son to Jerusalem, hailed the opening of the high-speed link. ""I personally have no problem with the line traversing the 'Green Line' (into the West Bank),"" he said.

JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's King Salman on Tuesday inaugurated a 6.7 billion euro ($7.87 billion) high-speed rail linking the two holiest cities in Islam, part of efforts to boost tourism revenues as the country seeks to shed dependence on oil exports.
The 450-km (280-mile) Haramain Railway connecting Mecca and Medina with the Red Sea coastal city of Jeddah is one of the largest transport projects in the Middle East, targeting nearly 60 million passengers annually. Commercial operations are set to begin next week.
""The journey between the Haramain (two holy mosques) is now shorter and easier than at any time before,"" Transport Minister Nabil al-Amoudi told dignitaries gathered at the Jeddah station. ""The project highlights the kingdom's commitment to serving Islam and Muslims.""
Pilgrimage is the backbone of a plan to expand tourism under economic reforms announced two years ago by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to diversify the economy. The haj, a journey every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it must perform once in a lifetime, can be a profound experience.
It is also big business for Saudi Arabia. The haj and the year-round lesser pilgrimage, umrah, generate billions of dollars in revenues from worshippers’ lodging, transport, gifts, food and fees.
The new rail link was built by a Spanish-led consortium and financed by the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund. It halves travel time between Mecca, the spiritual heart of Islam, and Medina, its second most sacred site.
Project manager Mohammed Fallatah said the train would offer fast and reliable transportation to pilgrims as well as Saudis and foreign residents.
""The traveler will be comfortable. He can read books or magazines or enjoy watching the screens in business class, have a coffee or a light meal,"" he said in an interview ahead of Tuesday's ceremony.
SERVING PILGRIMS 
The authorities hope the train will also stimulate growth of King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC), a massive business zone that was initiated under the previous ruler but remains relatively empty.
It will eventually link up with a new terminal at Jeddah airport, which has already started serving select domestic routes and will take over all flights by early next year.
Fatallah said further expansion could include connecting to a planned east-west train between the capital Riyadh and Jeddah.
Pilgrims comprise the bulk of Saudi Arabia’s 20 million annual foreign visitors, apart from workers and business travelers. More than two million came for this year’s haj and 6.5 million performed umrah in 2017.
Officials aim to increase the number of umrah and haj pilgrims to 15 million and five million respectively by 2020, and hope to double the umrah number again to 30 million by 2030.
In addition to public transit, Saudi Arabia is investing tens of billions of dollars in mega-hotels and a Grand Mosque restoration in Mecca.
The Faisalia project, running from the edge of Mecca toward the Red Sea, aims to attract visitors to coastal getaways and Islamic research centers.
Mecca governor Prince Khalid al-Faisal, a nephew of the king and one of his closest advisers, anticipates that the initiatives will contribute to social and cultural development alongside economic growth.
""We do not seek only to expand and develop. We want to expand and develop with distinction,"" he said in an interview.
""We want to begin from the point that others have already reached, not the point from which they began.""

The ""Swiss Law, Not Foreign Judges"" drive, which goes to a vote on Nov. 25 under the Swiss system of direct democracy, sees a need to anchor the supremacy of domestic law so that regular citizens can wrest back control from the political elite.
But the government dismissed the plan championed by the Swiss People's Party (SVP) -- the biggest in parliament and with two seats in the seven-member cabinet -- as too woolly and bound to undermine the Swiss reputation for stability and reliability.
""We should spare ourselves this dangerous experiment,"" Justice Minister Simonetta Sommaruga told reporters in Bern. She said it would force Switzerland to abrogate existing treaties and cast a shadow over future agreements it reached. 
Other critics, including the main business lobby, have said a vote in favor of the plan would undermine participation in the European Convention on Human Rights and harm the economy by making it harder or impossible to uphold trade pacts.
The SVP has often championed a Swiss-first approach, such as a successful 2014 referendum that demanded quotas on immigration, including from the European Union.
In implementing that vote, parliament in 2016 avoided quotas that would violate bilateral accords on the free movement of people between Switzerland the EU, its biggest trading partner. 
Angry SVP officials cried foul. The SVP often criticizes what it sees as efforts by politicians and courts to frustrate Swiss voters' wishes by citing international law. 
""The intent is clear: direct democracy, a Swiss specialty in which the citizens are sovereign, should be curtailed or even cut off,"" the SVP has said.
The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has indeed issued decisions that trumped Swiss court rulings.
In 2015, for instance, it ruled that a Swiss court had violated a Turkish politician's free speech rights when it fined him for denying that Armenians in Turkey had been victims of genocide a century ago. The politician, Dogu Perincek, made the comments during appearances in Switzerland.
Swiss anti-racism laws, the European court ruled, infringed on Perincek's right to voice his opinion.

It was the second time Rosmah, 66, has been called in by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) since the shock defeat of Najib in the May general election.
Rosmah was first questioned in June in connection with the investigation, which is looking into allegations of corruption and misappropriation in state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). Her husband has pleaded not guilty to charges of money laundering, abuse of power and criminal breach of trust.
The former first lady was served with a notice on Tuesday afternoon to appear before MACC the next day, her lawyer K.Kumaraendran said, adding that she was asked to assist with investigations under the anti-money laundering act.
A source familiar with the investigation said Rosmah would be questioned in connection with the 1MDB probe. 
After filing fresh charges against Najib last week, Azam Baki, the deputy commissioner of the anti-graft agency, said more charges could be brought against individuals over 1MDB.
When asked if Rosmah could face charges, he said: ""I'm not denying that.""
Rosmah's penchant for designer handbags, watches and jewelry raised eyebrows in Malaysia, with opponents asking how she was able to afford the luxury items on her husband's government salary. 
She has drawn comparisons to Imelda Marcos, who left behind more than 1,200 pairs of shoes when her husband Ferdinand Marcos was ousted as president of the Philippines in 1986.
Najib and Rosmah have both been barred from leaving the country since the former's election defeat, and their home and other properties linked to them have been searched by the police as part of the 1MDB investigations.
The haul seized from the properties included 567 handbags, 423 watches and 12,000 pieces of jewelry.
Najib has said most of the seized items were gifts given to his wife and daughter and had nothing to do with 1MDB.

The U.S. Department of Justice has alleged more than $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB and that about $680 million ended up in Najib's personal bank account. Najib has denied any wrongdoing.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Pakistani businessmen whose wives and children are trapped in China's restive Xinjiang are traveling to Beijing to lobby their embassy, in hopes that the south Asian nation's new government will pressure its ally for their release.
Beijing has faced an outcry from activists, some governments and U.N. human rights experts over mass detentions and strict surveillance of the mostly Muslim Uighur minority, and other Muslim groups, in the western region.
Mirza Imran Baig, 40, who trades between his home city of Lahore and Urumqui, the Xinjiang regional capital, said his wife was detained in a ""re-education"" camp in her native Bachu county for two months in May and June 2017 and had been unable to leave her hometown since her release.
His wife, Mailikemu Maimati, 33, and their four-year-old son, who are both Chinese nationals, are unable to get their passports back from Chinese authorities, he told Reuters outside the Pakistan embassy in Beijing.
""My ambassador says, 'Wait, wait, wait, one day, two days.' Okay, I wait,"" Baig said late on Tuesday, after his meeting.
Reuters could not immediately reach the ambassador, Masood Khalid, to seek comment.
Beijing says it faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists in Xinjiang and has rejected accusations of mistreatment.
Asked about the Pakistani businessmen on Tuesday, Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, told a regular news briefing that he was not aware of the situation. 
Muslim majority nations have mostly remained silent over the situation in Xinjiang. 
Last month's election of cricketing legend and firebrand nationalist Imran Khan as Pakistan's prime minister has fed the expectations of many for him to deliver on promises to create jobs, build an Islamic welfare state and restore the country's image abroad.
Mian Shahid Ilyas, a businessman in Lahore who has been collecting details of cases and seeking government support, said he was optimistic the new government would help.
Pakistan's foreign ministry in Islamabad did not reply to questions from Reuters on the Uighur spouses.
""A lot of people get married like us. It's no problem. But in 2017 they start to seal everything off in Xinjiang,"" Ilyas, who said his Chinese Uighur wife, a citizen of China, had been detained since April 2017, told Reuters by telephone.
Ilyas said he had confirmed details of 38 cases but believed there were more than 300 similar cases of Pakistani husbands whose wives and children, most of them Uighurs, had been stuck in Xinjiang for more than a year, in camps or confined to homes.
The handful of businessmen, including Baig, is traveling to China in groups of twos and threes, to avoid raising suspicion, parking themselves at the embassy to make their case, he said.

""This is China's big mistake,"" said Ilyas. ""Before people did not know how they treated Muslims. Now, everyone knows.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned leaders on Tuesday that world order is ""increasingly chaotic,"" trust is at breaking point and shifts in the balance of power may increase the risk of confrontation, though he did not lay blame.
As U.S. President Donald Trump prepared to tout protection of U.S. sovereignty at the annual U.N. gathering of world leaders, Guterres told the 193-member U.N. General Assembly that multilateralism is under fire when it is needed most.
""Individual leaders have the duty to advance the well-being of their people,"" Guterres said. ""But it runs deeper ... As guardians of the common good, we also have a duty to promote and support a reformed, reinvigorated and strengthened multilateral system."" 
He called for a renewed commitment to a rules-based order with the United Nations at its center and warned against a spreading ""politics of pessimism."" 
""Those who see their neighbors as dangerous may cause a threat where there was none. Those who close their borders to regular migration only fuel the work of traffickers,"" Guterres said. ""And those who ignore human rights in combating terrorism tend to breed the very extremism they are trying to end.""
He also urged leaders to tackle climate change with a greater sense of ambition and urgency and said he would hold a summit on the issue in September next year. The Trump administration withdrew from a global accord to reduce emissions last year. 

""If we do not change course in the next two years, we risk runaway climate change,"" Guterres said.

Researchers of three German universities examined 38,156 personnel files spanning a 70-year period ending 2014, and found indications of sexual abuse by 1,670 clerics, with more than 3,700 possible victims.
German magazine Der Spiegel reported the findings earlier this month after the report was leaked. The scandal comes at a time when the Catholic Church is grappling with a number of new sexual abuse cases in countries including Chile, the United States and Argentina. 
""For too long in the Church we have looked away, denied, covered up and didn't want it to be true,"" Cardinal Reinhard Marx, chairman of the German Bishops' Conference said at a news conference for the launch of the report in the central German city of Fulda on Tuesday. 
""For all the failure, pain and suffering, I must apologize as the chairman of the Bishops' Conference as well as personally,"" Marx said.
""The study opened our eyes to the fact that this issue has not been overcome,"" he said. 
Harald Dressing of the Central Institute of Mental Health said that number represented only the lower bound of estimates as many cases were likely never reported or not taken seriously enough to make note of them in the files.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The relatives of thousands of Indians who died cleaning sewers protested in the capital on Tuesday, aiming to stop the practice of workers entering underground conduits to unclog drains and remove waste with their bare hands.
Hundreds of protesters shouted slogans accusing the government of delaying compensation for sewer deaths, while others waved banners saying they came as Prime Minister Narendra Modi pushes his ""Swachh Bharat,"" or ""Clean India"", program.
""I lost my only son,"" said Saroj, a mother among the protesters, who hails from the northern city of Ludhiana in Punjab. ""He went into the sewers and never came out. How long will these deaths continue?""
One placard read, ""Eleven workers died in the sewers in seven days. 'Swachh Bharat' for whom?""
About 1,800 sewers cleaners have asphyxiated to death in the last decade, says the Safai Karamchari Andolan (SKA), a group that is campaigning to eliminate the practice.
Most of the roughly 160,000 workers involved in cleaning human waste are women, it added.
In 1993, India outlawed what it calls ""manual scavenging"", a practice that includes the barehanded cleaning of dry latrines, mostly by women and Dalits, who are at the bottom of Hinduism's social hierarchy.
For centuries, Dalits have battled discrimination ranging from segregation and ostracism to violence. Hindus are traditionally grouped into thousands of castes, their membership determined by birth.
Some members of India's lower castes still engage in unsafe cleaning practices, including the capital, where recent deaths sparked off the protests.

Workers picking up human waste with bare hands and broomsticks are a common sight on railway tracks and stations across the country.

The man, inebriated when he boarded the rush-hour bus, smacked the 21-year-old on the buttocks and made an insulting comment about her breasts, before a squabble with the bus driver, who jammed the doors shut while police were alerted.
A judge in Evry, south of Paris, sentenced the man, in his 30s, to three months behind bars for the slap, considered an act of outright sexual aggression, and added a fine of 300 euros ($353) for the offending comments.
Court and justice ministry officials said the fine was the first imposed under legislation that seeks to deter predatory remarks and harassing actions such as wolf-whistles, which are fairly commonplace in public life in France.
The minister behind the legislation, which also allows for on-the-spot fines of as much as 750 euros ($880), posted a message on Twitter hailing the court decision.
""Bravo for the bus driver's quick-wittedness and the penalty imposed,"" said Marlene Schiappa, the gender equality minister.
The sentence comes weeks after an episode of violent sexual harassment in the street was captured on CCTV footage.
In the video, a man who had wolf-whistled a 22-year-old woman outside a Paris cafe was seen punching her in the face after she rebuffed him with sharp words.
A suspect in that case was arrested in late August after the footage went viral, prompting a police hunt.
Globally, one in three women and girls experiences physical or sexual violence, the United Nations estimates. In France, a recent survey showed more than half -- 53 percent -- of women say they have experienced sexual harassment or assault.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Fifty thousand Syrians have returned home from Lebanon so far in 2018 and the number could reach 200,000 in a year's time if it continues at this rate, a top Lebanese official said on Tuesday.
Major General Abbas Ibrahim, head of Lebanon's General Security directorate, told Reuters his security agency had organized the return of 25,000 Syrians in coordination with Damascus. Another 25,000 had made their own way home.
Lebanon is hosting 976,000 registered Syrian refugees, according to the U.N. High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). The government says the total number of Syrians in the country is around 1.5 million.
Lebanese politicians have been calling for Syrian refugees to go home as President Bashar al-Assad wins back more of the country, saying Lebanon cannot cope with hosting a number of refugees equivalent to a quarter of its population.
Ibrahim is coordinating with Damascus over the return of thousands of Syrians who want to go home. 
Their names are first sent to Damascus for approval. Ibrahim said on average 10 percent of them are rejected by Damascus. Anyone wanted by the Syrian authorities is told so they can decide whether to stay or go home to ""settle their affairs"".
The Syrian conflict that erupted in 2011 has generated 5.6 million refugees in the Middle East.
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said during a visit to Beirut last month that refugees were concerned about issues including the lack of infrastructure and fear of retribution and military conscription.
Ibrahim expected the pace of returns to accelerate when the fate of rebel-held Idlib province is settled, noting that many young men did not want to return for fear of being conscripted for a battle in Idlib. ""When there are no longer big military battles in Syria, many young men will return,"" Ibrahim said. 
He said Syrians are given a six-month reprieve from military service ""to organize their affairs"". 
The UNHCR chief Grandi has said that for larger numbers to decide to go back, more confidence must be created by addressing issues of concern to refugees and UNHCR should have a presence in areas of return.

A Russian-Turkish agreement announced last week has staved off a threatened government offensive in Idlib, though the Syrian government is vowing that it will be recovered from rebels.

""We will continue to act to prevent Iranian military entrenchment in Syria and we will continue the military coordination between the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) and the Russian army,"" Netanyahu told reporters before boarding a flight to New York, where he will address the U.N. General Assembly.
Russia said on Monday it would supply an S-300 surface-to-air missile system to Syria in two weeks despite strong Israeli objections, a week after Moscow accused Israel of indirectly causing the downing of a Russian military jet in Syria.
Russia, which fights in Syria to support the government against rebels and militants, has said Syrian anti-aircraft batteries shot its IL-20 surveillance plane down by mistake shortly after Israeli jets hit a nearby target.
Moscow accused Israel of creating dangerous conditions that caused the incident.
Israel, which has carried out air strikes in Syria many times during the civil war, said after the incident it would work to improve ""deconfliction"" of its missions with Russian forces, but would not halt them.
Netanyahu spoke by telephone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday. In his remarks on Tuesday, Netanyahu said he had agreed with Putin ""that the working teams from the IDF and the Russian army will meet soon"".
The Israeli leader made the remarks after convening his security cabinet to discuss the tensions with Moscow.
""Over the past three years, Israel has been highly successful in preventing the Iranian military entrenchment in Syria and Iranian attempts to transfer lethal weaponry to Hezbollah in Lebanon,"" Netanyahu said.
But he said there had been occasions when things had not gone smoothly, calling Syria's downing of the Russian plane ""tragic"".

Israel has long lobbied Moscow not to provide the S-300 to Syria, fearing this would hinder its aerial capability to strike the forces of Iran and its Hezbollah allies in Syria.

About 15,000 refugees and migrants from Asia and North Africa have passed through Bosnia this year on their way to Europe's wealthier countries.
""The key challenge now is how to prepare for winter,"" said Stephanie Woldenberg, senior protection officer for the UNHCR refugee agency.

Several thousand migrants remain in Bosnia after Croatia tightened its borders and new people arrive daily, crossing illegally from Serbia.
Bosnia's state authorities say they are coping to refurbish inadequate facilities where migrants are currently accommodated but the process has been slow because of a lack of funding and cooperation from local counterparts.
Woldenberg said a priority for the authorities was to protect families with children, single women and unaccompanied minors. ""Safe appropriate accommodation must be provided for these groups as a priority,"" she said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Peru rejects a military solution to the crisis in Venezuela but further options are under discussion to increase pressure on the Maduro government to restore democracy, including a human rights complaint, Peru's president said in an interview.
Venezuela, which has suffered an economic collapse and mass emigration under Nicolas Maduro, is likely to be a focal point of the latest U.N. General Assembly in New York this week.
To that end, Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra said that fresh economic and diplomatic measures were under consideration against Venezuela, including a ""human rights"" complaint. But there could be no question of military action, he added.
""As a country, we must be clear to say we reject a warlike, military solution,"" Vizcarra told Reuters in New York.
""What we need to do is find a way to sanction the regime without affecting the population,"" he added.
Vizcarra did not elaborate on the rights initiative, though shortly after he spoke, Colombia's president Ivan Duque, also in New York, told an event that he and other heads of state would this week sign a declaration to denounce Maduro's government with the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague.
In May, the Organization of American States (OAS) accused the Maduro administration of committing ""crimes against humanity"", and vowed to present evidence to the ICC.
Peru and Colombia both belong to the so-called Lima Group of nations formed last year to address the crisis in Venezuela.
Venezuela has rejected criticism of the Maduro government as hostile propaganda and attempts to set the stage for an intervention by foreign powers in the country.
Pressure is steadily growing, however.
Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the United States was preparing a ""series of actions"" to raise pressure on Maduro, whom Washington and its allies accuse of stifling democracy by jailing opposition leaders.
DOMESTIC REFORM
Separately, Vizcarra, who last week won a confidence vote in Congress over his planned political and judicial reforms that seek to combat corruption in Peru, said he expected the remaining measures to pass before an Oct. 4 deadline.
Because of that, he saw no need to consider dissolving Congress - which could have occurred if he had lost the vote.
""Given the events of the past week, we can say that the problem is en route to being resolved,"" he said.
Vizcarra, who became president in March after his predecessor Pedro Pablo Kuczynski stood down when facing near-certain impeachment over a graft scandal, vowed to respect rulings made by the judiciary in pending probes of politicians.
To fail to do so would be to undermine the very confidence in the political system that he was trying to restore, he said.

Turning to trade, Vizcarra said that the Pacific Alliance - a bloc comprising Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Peru - could admit its four associate members Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Canada as soon as this November.

589,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",U.N. concerned over spike in civilian casualties in Afghan air strikes,"KABUL (Reuters) - The United Nations mission in Afghanistan on Tuesday said it was concerned by the increasing number of civilian casualties from air strikes this year, following reports that nine civilians were killed in the eastern province of Kapisa last week.
Air strikes have spiked steeply this year, in a strategy aimed at forcing Taliban militants to accept peace talks, with the number of bombs dropped by the U.S. air force almost doubling in the first six months, to nearly 3,000.
The UNAMA mission said it had received ""multiple, credible allegations"" that a strike hit the house of a teacher in Kapisa on Saturday, killing nine members of the same family, including three women and four children. Six others were wounded, it said.
""UNAMA reminds all parties to the conflict to uphold their obligations to protect civilians from harm,"" it said in a statement.
""The Mission repeats its earlier call for government forces to uphold their commitment to regular review of targeting protocols and ensure mitigation measures and compensation for victims.""
Mohammad Radmanish, a defense ministry spokesman confirmed civilian casualties during a joint operation by Afghan and U.S. forces that involved air support, but gave no details. He said an investigation was underway.
In a statement on Monday, the U.S. military in Kabul said U.S. helicopters supporting an Afghan army operation in Kapisa came under fire from a pro-government militia that had fired in error, and returned fire in self-defense, accidentally wounding six militia members.
""We have no indication of non-combatant casualties,"" it said.
The reports underlined one of the problems facing Gen. Scott Miller, the new U.S. commander in Afghanistan who took up his post this month and must balance the need to pressure the Taliban with the need to avoid civilian casualties.
United Nations data shows a jump of 52 percent in the number of civilians killed or wounded in air strikes in the first six months of the year. The U.N. said 149 civilians were killed and 204 wounded in air attacks in the year's first half, with women and children comprising more than half the 353 casualties.
Since the figures were reported in July, the U.N. said it had recorded increasing numbers of civilian casualties from air strikes.

LONDON (Reuters) - The top adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader on Tuesday rejected a U.S. offer for top-level meetings, as both countries' presidents were due to attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards also kept up the anti-U.S. rhetoric in the build up to the U.N. session, calling President Donald Trump ""evil and adventurous"" and accusing him of waging economic war on Tehran.
Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran in May, and has since started reinstating economic penalties and pressing other countries to stop buying Iranian oil.
Trump said in July he was ready to meet Iran's President Hassan Rouhani without preconditions to negotiate a new deal. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo repeated the offer on Sunday and expanded it to Supreme leader Ayatollah Khamenei, telling Fox News: ""That's who's running the show in Iran. I think that would be an important and interesting conversation."" 
President Rouhani, seen as a moderate, has stopped short of ruling out meetings between the two countries. But he has come under increasing pressure from hardliners, including the Guards, since Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear accord.
Asked about the offer of talks, Khamenei's top aide, Ali Akbar Velayati, said ""Trump's and Pompeo's dream would never come to reality,"" according to the IRNA news agency.
The Revolutionary Guards' statement read: ""The evil and adventurous American president has focused on an economic war and cruel sanctions to deviate the Iranian nation from the revolutionary values and its national interests.""
Iran curbed its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief in the 2015 nuclear accord. Trump pulled out, saying the agreement did not go far enough.
But the other countries that signed it - who think the pact offers the best chance of stopping Iran developing a nuclear bomb - agreed on Monday to keep working to maintain trade with Tehran.
Separately, the Guards also said the Saturday’s attack on a military parade that killed 25 people was a “miscalculation by the enemies as this crime has only made the Iranian nation more united.”

Iran accused the United States of supporting the assailants who carried out the attack, but Washington has denied any prior knowledge of the incident.

591,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",Austrian leader rejects far right's plan to shut out some media,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria's chancellor said on Tuesday a proposal by his far-right coalition partners to shut out several newspapers was unacceptable, suggesting fresh tensions between the ruling parties.
Two of Austria's three main national newspapers on Tuesday published details of an email sent to police spokespeople by the Interior Ministry, which is controlled by the far-right Freedom Party (FPO). The email suggested communications with the papers and one other be reduced to ""what is absolutely necessary"".
""Any restriction of press freedom is unacceptable,"" Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said in a statement responding to the reports, though he avoided referring to them specifically.
""The shutting out or boycotting of selected media cannot take place in Austria,"" he said. ""That goes for those in charge of communications at all ministries and all public institutions.""
The email accused the broadsheets Kurier and Der Standard and left-wing weekly newspaper Falter of ""very one-sided and negative reporting"" about the ministry or the police, without providing examples or details.
The Interior Ministry confirmed that the email was authentic and sent by its chief spokesman but said it was not binding and consisted of suggestions rather than instructions.
The FPO is critical of some media for what it says is biased coverage, but its accusations are less frequent and generally less vociferous than the ""fake news"" charges made by some right-wing figures, such as U.S. President Donald Trump.
In a posting on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in February, FPO leader and Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache accused national broadcaster ORF of lying. He defended the posting as a prank but later agreed to pay damages to the news anchor pictured in the posting and issued an apology.
Leaders of the FPO, which controls the foreign, interior and defense ministries, and Kurz's conservatives have largely managed to avoid public disputes while in government together. 
Anti-Semitism scandals involving FPO officials and accusations of a political purge by the FPO at an intelligence agency controlled by the Interior Ministry have caused some tensions but the two parties have kept their focus on an agenda heavy on law and order and restricting illegal immigration. 
The Interior Ministry memo also said the nationality and immigration status of foreigners suspected of committing crimes should be made public and called for greater communication of sexual offences. The government has made tougher minimum sentences for sexual offences a priority.

Kurz made no mention of those aspects in his statement.

Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann, 66, confirmed his decision to leave the seven-member government effective Dec. 31 in a letter to parliament in which he describes Switzerland as ""a little paradise"".
Although his exit from Switzerland's compromise-minded executive branch hardly sets off global shockwaves -- he had hinted for months it was coming -- it does spell the departure of a reliably pro-business, pro-Europe member just as Switzerland is embroiled in tense talks over renewing bilateral ties with the bloc.
Both the center-left and the far right oppose a new treaty that Brussels wants to cement ties, so there are no guarantees of a successful deal. Some in Switzerland fear failure could mean new barriers to trade for exporters.
The cabinet is due to spell out its strategy on Friday.
Schneider-Ammann this year failed to bring Swiss unions to the bargaining table, ending hopes of a possible compromise over measures that protect high-wage Switzerland from undercutting by European companies eager to work across the border.
Schneider-Ammann's exit will set off jockeying within his Liberal Democratic Party over who will replace him. Candidates being talked about include party leader Petra Goessi. 
Although Schneider-Ammann had a reputation for a no-frills approach suited to leading his family's business that makes asphalt and concrete plants as well as road pavers, he tried during his tenure to lighten things up, not always successfully.

While serving as Swiss president in 2016 he gave a stone-faced speech extolling the medical benefits of laughter where he purposely did not smile once. Recordings went viral, prompting one commentator to say Schneider-Ammann was ""about as funny as a funeral director"".

GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization said on Tuesday that an Ebola outbreak in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo could worsen rapidly because of attacks by armed groups, community resistance and the geographic spread of the disease. 
""We are now extremely concerned that several factors may be coming together over the next weeks and months to create a potential perfect storm,"" WHO's head of emergency response Peter Salama told a news conference in Geneva. 
At least 100 people have died in the outbreak, out of 150 cases in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.
The response was at a critical juncture, and although the weekly number of new cases has fallen from about 40 to about 10 in the past few weeks and more than 11,700 people have been vaccinated, there were major obstacles ahead, Salama said. 
Attacks by armed opposition groups had increased in severity and frequency, especially those attributed to the Alliance of Democratic Forces, most dramatically an attack that killed 21 in the city of Beni, where WHO's operation is based.
The city has declared a ""ville morte"", a period of mourning until at least Friday, obliging WHO to suspend its operations. 
On Monday 80 percent of Ebola contacts -- people at risk of developing the disease and so requiring monitoring -- and three suspected cases in and around Beni could not be reached for disease monitoring.
EXPLOITATION
Pockets of ""reluctance, refusal and resistance"" to accept Ebola vaccination were generating many of the new cases, Salama said.
""We also see a very concerning trend. That resistance, driven by quite natural fear of this terrifying disease, is starting to be exploited by local politicians, and we're very concerned in the run up to elections, projected for December, that that exploitation... will gather momentum and make it very difficult to root out the last cases of Ebola.""
Some people were fleeing into the forest to escape Ebola follow-up treatment and checks, sometimes moving hundreds of kilometers, he said. 
There was one such case to the south of Beni, and another to the north, close to the riverbanks of Lake Albert. Both were inaccessible for security reasons.
Neighboring Uganda was now facing an ""imminent threat"", and social media posts were conflating Ebola with criticism of the DRC government and the United Nations and ""a range of conspiracy theories"", which could put healthworkers at risk.
""We will not yet consider the need to evacuate but we are developing a range of contingency plans to see where our staff are best located,"" he said.

""If WHO and its partners had to leave North Kivu ... we would have grave concerns that this outbreak would not be able to be well controlled in the coming weeks or months.""

594,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>","Outrage over Church's handling of sexual abuse scandals justified, pope says","By Andrius Sytas and Philip Pullella
TALLINN (Reuters) - Pope Francis said on Tuesday that young people around the world were right to feel outrage at the Roman Catholic Church's handling of its sexual abuse scandals as it grapples with a wave of new cases in countries including Chile and Germany.
Francis, who was wrapping up a four-day trip to the Baltics, has come under fire from victims groups and other members of the Church who say he has not done enough to make bishops accountable for mishandling or covering up abuse cases. 
""They are outraged when they do not see clear condemnations of sexual and economic scandals,"" he told about 1,000 young people gathered in a Lutheran church in the Estonian capital Tallinn.
He spoke hours before the Catholic Church in Germany was due to present a report on its sexual abuse record. Its findings were leaked to German magazine Der Spiegel earlier this month and showed that nearly 1,700 of its clerics and priests had sexually abused 3,677 minors over a 70-year period ending in 2014.
A similar study in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania shook the American Catholic Church in August and last week the number of Chilean bishops who have resigned over a recent sex abuse scandal rose to seven.
Francis wrote an unprecedented letter to all Catholics last month, asking each one to help root out ""this culture of death"" and last year said the Catholic Church had ""arrived late"" in dealing with sexual abuse of children by priests. 
The Church has also suffered a series of fraud scandals. Francis has made cleaning up the Vatican's murky finances a priority since his election in 2013. A report in April by the Holy See's Financial Intelligence Authority showed that reforms designed to end decades of misconduct were now well-rooted.
Estonia, the last stop of the pope's three-nation tour, has only about 4,500 Catholics, or about 0.4 percent of the population of 1.3 million, according to a 2011 census. A majority said they have no religious identification.

Francis returns to Rome on Tuesday night.

Faisal Mekdad, deputy foreign minister, described the Idlib agreement as part of a wider diplomatic track that created ""de-escalation"" zones in several areas which he noted had later returned to state rule, Syria's al-Watan newspaper reported.
""As we were victorious in every part of Syria we will be victorious in Idlib and the message is very clear to everyone who is concerned by this matter: We are coming to Idlib through war or peaceful means,"" Mekdad said.
The Russian-Turkish agreement last week staved off a threatened government attack by agreeing on the creation of a demilitarized zone between insurgent and government forces in the northwest.
The United Nations says close to three million people live in the rebel-held area, and warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in the event of an offensive.
Under the agreement, announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan in Sochi, insurgents deemed ""radical"" are to withdraw from the demilitarized zone by the middle of October.
Turkey, which backs some of the rebels in Idlib, is to jointly patrol the demilitarized zone with Russia, President Bashar al-Assad's most powerful ally. Heavy weapons are to be removed from the demilitarized zone by Oct. 10.
The Idlib region and an adjoining area north of Aleppo represent the last major opposition stronghold in Syria, following the defeat of anti-Assad insurgents across most of the country in military campaigns backed by Russia and Iran.
Turkey-allied rebels in Idlib welcomed the agreement, saying it would keep the region out of Assad's hands. Mekdad said however that all Syrian territory would return to state control, echoing Assad's vow to recover ""every inch"" of the country.
The main jihadist group Idlib, Tahrir al-Sham, has yet to state its position on the agreement.
Smaller jihadist factions have rejected it.
Turkey, which is already hosting 3.5 million Syrian refugees, is determined to prevent another influx.

While declaring that ""radicals"" must withdraw, Turkey has said the Syrian opposition will stay in their existing areas under the agreement.

Portuguese Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva said he had ""a tough conversation"" over the issue with his Venezuelan counterpart Jorge Arreaza in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Monday.
The brewing diplomatic row could sour relations between Portugal's left-leaning government and the cash-strapped leftist government of Venezuela, where about 400,000 Portuguese citizens and people of Portuguese origin live. Venezuela is suffering from hyperinflation and shortages of basic goods.
""I told my counterpart that there is a red line for us, and if there is no progress in overcoming this problem there would be consequences for the bilateral relationship,"" Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva said in televised comments.
He called Venezuela's latest crackdown on businesses ""an administrative initiative directed against Portuguese interests in Venezuela"". The foreign ministry on Friday summoned the Venezuelan ambassador to Lisbon to tell him Portugal was ""very preoccupied"" with the detentions.
Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro said last week that 34 supermarket managers had been jailed on charges of hiding food and over-charging for it. Local media reported that many of the arrested managers worked at Central Madeirense, a chain founded some 70 years ago by Portuguese immigrants. 
Portugal's foreign ministry said there were ""various Portuguese nationals and people of Portuguese origin"" among the 34 jailed managers. 

After the summoning of the ambassador, Arreaza replied in a tweet over the weekend that Venezuela valued its Portuguese community, but the judiciary investigated crimes regardless of the origin of the suspects.

The arrest of Senator Antonio Trillanes is the latest round in his sparring with Duterte, whom he accuses of hiding wealth and being responsible for alleged executions of thousands of suspected criminals and drug dealers, which Duterte denies.
Trillanes has backed several complaints to the International Criminal Court (ICC) seeking the president's indictment for crimes against humanity and has protected people willing to testify against Duterte.
""This is a debacle and a defeat of democracy,"" Trillanes, a former navy officer, who accompanied arresting officers into a vehicle and was taken to a police station to be photographed and fingerprinted before posting bail, told reporters.
""We expect other forms of harassment in the days to come,"" he said, adding that he expected the worst.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said it was time for Trillanes to stop grandstanding.
""The court has spoken,"" he said in a statement. ""Let us stop the drama by press conference and allow the legal process to take its course.""
Trillanes, a household name in the Philippines for his efforts to bring down the president, has stolen the political limelight in the three weeks since Duterte voided an amnesty given him by predecessor Benigno Aquino, citing flaws in the procedure, including a missing application form.
He had been holed up in his office under the Senate's protection since Duterte's order for the police and army to arrest him, although they were reluctant to do so.
Duterte later agreed a court warrant was necessary, following an outcry from opponents and legal experts who called it authoritarian and unconstitutional.
Trillanes received clemency after involvement in a failed 2003 coup and a mutiny four years later, both aimed at overthrowing then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, an ally of Duterte who is now lower house speaker.
Two lower courts had dismissed rebellion charges against him based on the amnesty.
On Tuesday, a poll showed Duterte suffered the biggest ratings slump of his presidency in the third quarter, amid signs of public unease about rising inflation and the cost of staple foodgrain rice.
Duterte's critics have accused him of trying to distract the public and prioritizing a settling of scores rather than tackling problems like inflation, which his office rejects.

LIVERPOOL, England (Reuters) - Britain's opposition Labour Party will vote against any deal Prime Minister Theresa May clinches with the European Union and is open to a second referendum with the option of staying in the bloc, Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said on Tuesday.
With just over six months until Britain leaves the European Union, May has yet to reach a deal with Brussels on the terms of the divorce, and her plan for future trade ties has been rebuffed by both the EU and many lawmakers in her own party.
Labour has listed six tests it would apply to any Brexit deal, including whether it ensured a strong future relationship with the EU and delivered the same benefits Britain has as a current member of the bloc's single market and customs union.
Starmer said May was on course to fail these tests.
""Everybody recognizes the talks are going badly and it looks as though we're heading for a bad deal or even no deal,"" he told BBC TV. ""We, the Labour Party, are going to vote down a bad deal or we're going to vote down no deal because that is not good for our country nor is it what people voted for.""
In a speech to his party's annual conference later, Starmer will say the Conservative government does not have a credible plan for Brexit, and that there is no majority in parliament for May's so-called ""Chequers"" proposals, which envisage close ties with the EU in the trade of goods.
Labour could play a decisive role in whether any Brexit deal is approved by parliament. May has a working majority of just 13 in the 650-seat parliament and a former junior minister said this month as many as 80 of her own lawmakers were prepared to vote against a Brexit deal based on the Chequers proposals.
SECOND REFERENDUM?
But like the governing Conservatives and much of the country, Labour is split over how to leave the bloc, with its veteran eurosceptic leader, Jeremy Corbyn, under pressure from many members to move to a more pro-EU position. [L8N1WA260]
Labour's conference will vote later on Tuesday on keeping a second Brexit referendum as an option if May fails to get her Brexit plan through parliament, heaping pressure on the struggling prime minister.
In the published motion which the Labour conference will debate later on Tuesday, the party again set out is position on Brexit - it wants full participation in the EU's single market after Brexit and will reject a ""no deal Brexit"".
If talks with the EU fail or parliament rejects a deal May brings back, Labour would firstly seek a new general election. If there is no possibility for one, Labour ""must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote"", the motion says.
Starmer said a meeting of party officials on Sunday had agreed that any second vote could allow for Britons to vote to stay in the EU after all. That seemed to contradict the view expressed by the party's finance spokesman, who has said a vote should be on how to leave the EU, not whether to do so.
""The question that would be asked was left open because we don't yet know the circumstance we'll find ourselves in,"" Starmer said. ""The meeting on Sunday was very clear that the question would be wide enough to encompass the option of remain. Nothing is being ruled out, including the option of remain.""
The government's Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said on Monday that Labour's ""nonsense"" about a second referendum would encourage the EU to offer a ""lousy"" deal and most people in Britain just wanted politicians to get on with Brexit.
""Labour seem determined to take us all back to square one by rejecting a deal out of hand then trying to delay Brexit and re-run the referendum,"" junior Brexit minister Robin Walker said in a statement.

""Labour promised to respect the referendum result, but are just playing political games and trying to frustrate it.""

Part of President Xi Jinping's war on corruption has also taken aim at lazy bureaucrats who waste time on red tape and simply mouth slogans without putting into effect government policies.
In its latest missive to crack down on such behavior, the party's anti-graft watchdog the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection detailed the types of actions it would be going after.
That includes officials who hold meetings simply for the sake of holding meetings, ""mechanically"" spout slogans, and ""swallow dates whole"", or read hastily and without thinking what they are actually looking at, the watchdog said.
Officials have to take seriously the concerns of their citizens and try to tackle their problems with enthusiasm, and are not allowed to run ""zombie"" websites that are never updated and service telephone lines which are never answered, it added.
Economic issues are mentioned too, specifically those that involve officials sitting on their hands or acting ""chaotically"" when it comes to economic work and reform, such as faking statistics, covering up problems or lying about them, the watchdog said.
China has long tried to rein in fake statistics. Last year, the ""rustbelt"" northeastern province of Liaoning said it had falsified reporting of fiscal data from 2011 to 2014.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven lost a no-confidence vote in parliament on Tuesday and will step down after four years in power, but with neither major political bloc holding a majority it remained unclear who will form the next government. 
Voters delivered a hung parliament in the Sept. 9 election with Lofven's center-left bloc garnering 144 seats, one more than the center-right opposition Alliance.
The anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, with 62 seats and shunned by all parties since entering parliament in 2010, backed the Alliance in the vote - an obligatory test of the prime minister's parliamentary support after an election.
Analysts expect the speaker to pick Ulf Kristersson, leader of the biggest Alliance party, the Moderates, to try to form a new administration.
But lacking a majority, he needs support either from the Sweden Democrats, with roots in the white supremacist fringe, or the center left. 
""If the Alliance parties choose to try to govern as the smallest bloc, then they make themselves totally dependent on the Sweden Democrats,"" Lofven said.
Sweden Democrat leader Jimmie Akesson repeated on Tuesday his party wanted a say in policy as the price of supporting a new government.
""We will do everything in our power to stop any attempt to form a government, do everything to bring down every government, which does not give us a reasonable influence in proportion to our electoral support,"" Akesson said.
The Alliance of the Moderates, Centre, Liberal and Christian Democrats has said it will not negotiate with the Sweden Democrats, who want to freeze immigration and have called for a new vote on membership of the European Union. 
Lofven ruled out backing an Alliance government, leaving politics deadlocked.
""I want to continue to lead the country as prime minister,"" he said.
""I want to lead a government that has broader support in the country's parliament and that allows us to leave stalemate of bloc politics.""
The speaker has four goes at finding a new government and if the stalemate continues, Sweden will hold another election within three months. 
With a new vote unlikely to change the situation much, some kind of compromise is likely to be thrashed out.
A number of party combinations have been suggested, but all would have a heavy political cost and a deal is could take weeks.
Lofven will lead a transition government until a new administration is installed.

China and India are going head-to-head for influence in the Indian Ocean nation, a string of palm-fringed islands and atolls 325 miles (523 km) southwest of India's southern tip.
In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang congratulated Solih, saying China respected the Maldivian people's choice and wanted to consolidate their traditional friendship.
""China has always encouraged Chinese companies to invest in and operate in the Maldives in accordance with market principles, to play a positive role in the Maldives' socio-economic development,"" Geng told a daily news briefing.
He was responding to a query whether China was concerned the new president could seek to renegotiate the two countries' free trade deal. 
Before the election, the Maldives opposition said it would review China's investments in its Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, partly out of concern over terms, as experts have warned that the archipelago risked falling into a debt trap.
China has part-funded and built an extension to the Maldives' international airport, as well as a bridge linking it to the capital, Male. 
Both countries had benefited from cooperation within the Belt and Road framework, Geng added. 
""We hope that the Maldives side can preserve continuity and stability of the relevant policies, and create good operating conditions for Chinese companies working there.""
China is willing to work with the Maldives to fully put into practice the free trade agreement to continue expanding investment and trade cooperation, he added, without elaborating. 

Yameen, who had drawn the Maldives closer to China since 2013 in a Beijing-backed infrastructure boom, conceded defeat after election officials said Solih, who wants to normalize ties with traditional ally India, had won.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece moved another 400 people from its biggest migrant camp on Tuesday as the International Rescue Committee (IRC) charity warned of a mental health emergency there with 30 percent of people having attempted suicide.
The government, under pressure from aid groups and local authorities, has said it will transfer 2,000 people from Moria camp on Lesbos to the mainland by the end of the month.
In a report published on Tuesday, the IRC said asylum-seekers in Moria, most of whom are Syrian, Iraqi and Afghan, were under ""enormous mental strain"".
Citing testimonials of patients who have visited its own clinic on the island, IRC said that in addition to the 30 percent of people who had attempted suicide about 60 percent had contemplated it. 
""Several times I have attempted suicide,"" it quoted Ahmad, a 35-year-old Iraqi single father of four children as saying. ""The only reason I am glad I didn't succeed is because of the children."" 
Asylum seekers were living in conditions that did not meet humanitarian standards, IRC said. Eighty-four people shared one shower and 72 shared one toilet.
""The sewage system is so overwhelmed that raw sewage has been known to reach the mattresses where children sleep, and flows untreated into open drains and sewers,"" IRC said.
Moria, in a disused military base, now holds nearly three times as many people as it was designed to, according to government figures, forcing hundreds to spill over in tents in an olive grove. 
Close to 900 people were moved between Sept. 10-20 and a another 1,000 will be transferred this week, Migration Minister Dimitris Vitsas said on Monday. Most are taken to facilities in northern Greece.
Jana Frey, IRC's Greece director, said the government needed to sustain efforts to ease overcrowding.
""We need a long-term strategy that ensures we never again see conditions like this at Moria,"" Frey said.

Small numbers of boats carrying migrants and refugees continue to arrive on Greece's islands every week. A slow asylum process and huge backlog of applications mean it can take months for decisions to be delivered.

The amphibious assault ship Wasp had been due to make a port call in the former British colony of Hong Kong in October, diplomatic sources said.
""The Chinese Government did not approve a request for a U.S. port visit to Hong Kong by the USS Wasp,"" a consulate spokeswoman said. 
""We have a long track record of successful port visits to Hong Kong, and we expect that to continue,"" she added. 
In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang did not directly answer a question on whether China had denied the request.
""For requests for U.S. military ships to visit Hong Kong, China has always carried out approvals case by case, in accordance with the principle of sovereignty and the detailed situation,"" he told reporters, without elaborating.
In 2016, at a time of heightened tension over its territorial claims in the disputed South China Sea, China denied a request for a U.S. carrier strike group led by the John C. Stennis to visit Hong Kong. 
On Saturday, China summoned the U.S. ambassador in Beijing and postponed joint military talks in protest against a U.S. decision to sanction a Chinese military agency and its director for buying Russian fighter jets and a surface-to-air missile system.

China and the United States are also embroiled in an increasingly bitter trade war.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Efforts to rescue Tunisia's ailing economy face the prospect of fresh turmoil after the president declared his alliance with moderate Islamists at an end, deepening divisions in a fragile coalition managing the country's transition from autocracy.
Political analysts say Monday evening's announcement by President Beji Caid Essebsi could make it difficult for the government to enact tough economic reforms sought by international lenders.
""There will be no real risk of toppling the government in parliament, but the problem is that division will deepen, social tension will rise and reforms are threatened under a fragile government coalition,"" Nizar Makni, a journalist and analyst said.
""Reforms need broad consensus and the lack of compromise may lead to mass protests in the streets, especially that powerful unions rejected all proposed reforms"", he added. 
Although struggling with high unemployment and inflation, the coalition of moderate Islamists and secular forces has been running what has been hailed as the Arab Spring's only democratic success, avoiding the upheaval seen in Egypt, Libya or Syria. 
The Ennahda Islamist party and secular Nidaa Tounes agreed in 2014 on a constitution granting far-reaching political rights, limiting the role of religion and holding free elections, which stands out in a region often run by autocrats.
But Tunisia fell into a political crisis again this year after Essebsi's son, who is the leader of Nidaa Tounes, called for the dismissal of prime minister Youssef Chahed because of his government's failure to revive the economy. 
His demand was supported by the powerful UGTT union, which rejected economic reforms proposed by Chahed.
AUSTERITY
But Ennahda came to Chahed's defense, saying the departure of the prime minister would hit stability at a time when the country needed economic reforms.
In his more than two years in office, Chahed has pushed through austerity measures and structural reforms, such as cutting fuel subsidies that have helped to underpin a $2.8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other financial support.
The president raised the stakes on Monday evening.
""The consensus and relationship between me and Ennahha has ended, after they chose to form another relationship with Youssef Chahed,"" Essebsi, the founder of Nidaa Tounes, said in a televised interview.
Analysts said the president's announcement would probably not lead to the overthrow of the government, which still has the support of at least 110 of a total 217 lawmakers in parliament. 
But Chahed could find it difficult to enact tough reforms in the face of a strong opposition front including the unions, the president and Nidaa Tounes party.
Last week the UGTT labor union called a public sector strike for Oct. 24 to protest at Chahed's privatization plans.
""The president's comments will deepen the crisis,"" senior Ennahda official Lotfi Zitoun told Reuters. 
""Ennahda seeks stability and a dialogue that includes all partners to get out of the crisis.""
By surviving for more than two years, Chahed has become the longest-serving of Tunisia's nine prime ministers since its Arab Spring democratic revolution in 2011.
Chahed has gathered enough support in parliament to stave off a possible vote of no confidence by working with Ennahda and a number of other lawmakers including 10 Nidaa Tounes rebels. 

Since 2011 uprising, nine cabinets have failed to resolve Tunisia's economic problems, which include high inflation and unemployment, and impatience is rising among lenders such as the IMF, which have kept the country afloat.

Despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness to social change, Vietnam's ruling Communist Party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism. 
A district court found Doan Khanh Vinh Quang, 42, guilty of ""abusing democratic and freedom rights"" to infringe the interests of the state, individuals and organizations, police in Can Tho City said on Monday.
Quang's actions ""seriously affected the political security and social order and safety"", the police said in a statement, adding that he had admitted to having written and shared posts insulting the Party and the country since 2015.
He was arrested in early September as authorities found his Facebook posts ""distort the guidelines and policies of the party and the state"" and called for people to protest, they said on their website.
Reuters could not trace contact details for Quang's lawyer to seek comment.
Facebook has a direct channel for Vietnam's information ministry to request the blocking or removal of accounts, content or posts deemed to violate the law. Many activists have complained about growing blocking of content this year.
Not all the ministry's requests are met, however, and acting information minister Nguyen Manh Hung this month proposed to set up a working group to improve communications between the government and Facebook.
Police said Quang also received two flags of the U.S.-backed Republic of Vietnam, the former state in the country's southern half until the Vietnam War ended in 1975, from another Facebook user living overseas and agreed to hang them.
They added that Quang use Facebook to urge people to turn out for street demonstrations against a controversial draft law to develop economic zones against which thousands had protested in several cities in June.

U.S. military sales to self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its territory, is an irritant in the relations between the world's two largest economies. Taiwan would still need to finalize details of the sale with U.S. companies.
""This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security and defensive capability of the recipient, which has been and continues to be an important force for political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,"" the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement issued on Monday.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan were a serious breech of international law and harmed Chinese sovereignty and security interests.
China strongly opposes the planned arms sales and has already lodged ""stern representations"" with the United States, he told a daily news briefing in Beijing. 
China urges the United States to withdraw the planned sale and stop military contacts with Taiwan, to avoid serious harm to both Sino-U.S. cooperation in major areas, and peace and stability in the Taiwan strait, Geng added.
China is deeply suspicious of U.S. intentions toward Taiwan, which is equipped with mostly U.S.-made weaponry and wants Washington to sell it more advanced equipment, including new fighter jets.
In a statement on Tuesday, Taiwan's Presidential Office thanked the United States for its support and said the island would continue to ""stay in close communication and cooperation"" with Washington for issues including security. 
Military experts said the balance of power between Taiwan and China has shifted in favor of China, which could probably overwhelm the island unless U.S. forces came quickly to its aid.
The $330 million request covers spare parts for ""F-16, C-130, F-5, Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF), all other aircraft systems and subsystems, and other related elements of logistics and program support,"" the Pentagon said, adding that it notified Congress of the possible sale.  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) makes the F-16.
The Pentagon said the proposed sale is required to maintain Taiwan's ""defensive and aerial fleet,"" and would not alter the military balance in the region.
China has never renounced the use of force to bring what it sees as a wayward province under its control.

Chinese President Xi Jinping told U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis during a visit to Beijing in June that Beijing was committed to peace, but could not give up ""even one inch"" of territory that the country's ancestors had left behind.

""For the moment it's 'no',"" Bruno Le Maire said when asked on BFM TV if Paris was ready to respond positively to a request from charities for permission to dock with 58 people aboard in the southern French port.
Le Maire said ships were supposed to dock at the nearest port under European rules and Marseille was not the nearest.
""On matters of migration, the issue must be handled firmly and clearly, and European rules respected,"" the minister said.
Aquarius 2 is the one remaining charity rescue vessel still operating in the Central Mediterranean area, picking up migrants who are in many cases trying to get to Europe from Libya.
The charity groups suffered a major blow on Monday, when in addition to the recent barring of their boats at Italian ports, Panama authorities revoked the Aquarius vessel's registration.

Duterte's approval rating, a measure of his performance, dropped 13 points to 75 percent in a survey of 1,800 voting-age Filipinos conducted by Pulse Asia this month.
His trust rating, which gauges sentiment about his personality, fell 15 points to 72 percent. A similar poll in June had scored him at 88 percent and 87 percent respectively. 
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said Duterte, who has been in office since June 2016, was unperturbed by ratings and was focused on doing his job.
""We are not affected by it because the president will do his best to discharge his duties,"" Roque told a regular news briefing. ""I believe that's still a very good approval rating.""
Roque said rising inflation could have caused the drop in the ratings because higher prices for rice, have negated the administration's gains in other areas.
The survey was conducted in the first week of September, when official data showed annual inflation at 6.4 percent in August, the highest in nearly a decade.
It came amid calls to abolish the grains import agency and in a week when a graft complaint was made against its chief, who has since resigned.

Another pollster, Social Weather Stations, released results this month of a second-quarter poll that showed trust in Duterte had dropped to its lowest level during his presidency, although he maintained a rating of ""very good"".

Cambodians visit pagodas across the country during the 15-day festival that takes place annually to offer prayers and food to the spirits of their deceased relatives, who they believe only emerge to eat the food during this period.
At Tuol Tumpoung pagoda in the capital Phnom Penh, hundreds of people crowded the temple complex to offer food and money to Buddhist monks to the backdrop of chanting.
""During the first day of Pchum Ben, our dead relatives came to find us for food,"" Mang Noy, 74, told Reuters at Tuol Tumpoung pagoda.
For many, it is a time to remember the victims of the 1975-1979 Khmer Rouge regime. 
At least 1.8 million Cambodians - about a quarter of the population - were killed by the Khmer Rouge. Most of the victims died of starvation, torture, exhaustion or disease in labor camps or were bludgeoned to death during mass executions.
Mang Noy said her family's food offerings were for more than 20 relatives killed by the regime.

""We came here today to offer food to all our relatives who passed away so that they can have enough to eat and so that they can also wish us well,"" she said.

611,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2018 12:23AM ET</span>",U.S. accuses Myanmar military of 'planned and coordinated' Rohingya atrocities,"By Matt Spetalnick and Jason Szep
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. government investigation has found that Myanmar's military waged a ""well-planned and coordinated"" campaign of mass killings, gang rapes and other atrocities against the Southeast Asian nation’s Rohingya Muslim minority.
The U.S. State Department report, which was released on Monday, could be used to justify further U.S. sanctions or other punitive measures against Myanmar authorities, U.S. officials told Reuters.
But it stopped short of describing the crackdown as genocide or crimes against humanity, an issue that other U.S. officials said was the subject of fierce internal debate that delayed the report's rollout for nearly a month.
The report, which was first reported by Reuters, resulted from more than a thousand interviews of Rohingya men and women in refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh, where almost 700,000 Rohingya have fled after a military campaign last year in Myanmar's Rakhine State.
“The survey reveals that the recent violence in northern Rakhine State was extreme, large-scale, widespread, and seemingly geared toward both terrorizing the population and driving out the Rohingya residents,” according to the 20-page report. “The scope and scale of the military’s operations indicate they were well-planned and coordinated.”
Survivors described in harrowing detail what they had witnessed, including soldiers killing infants and small children, the shooting of unarmed men, and victims buried alive or thrown into pits of mass graves. They told of widespread sexual assault by Myanmar’s military of Rohingya women, often carried out in public.
Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay declined to comment when reached on Tuesday and said he was unable to answer questions by telephone.
Calls to military spokesman Major General Tun Tun Nyi were unanswered.
One witness described four Rohingya girls who were abducted, tied up with ropes and raped for three days. They were left ""half dead,"" he said, according to the report.
Human rights groups and Rohingya activists have put the death toll in the thousands from the crackdown, which followed attacks by Rohingya insurgents on security forces in Rakhine State in August 2017.
U.N. REPORT FOUND 'GENOCIDAL INTENT'
The results of the U.S. investigation were released in low-key fashion - posted on the State Department's website - nearly a month after U.N. investigators issued their own report accusing Myanmar’s military of acting with ""genocidal intent"" and calling for the country’s commander-in-chief and five generals to be prosecuted under international law.
The military in Myanmar, previously known as Burma, where Buddhism is the main religion, has denied accusations of ethnic cleansing and says its actions were part of a fight against terrorism.
U.S. Senior State Department officials said the objective of the investigation was not to determine genocide but to ""document the facts"" on the atrocities to guide U.S. policy aimed at holding the perpetrators accountable. The report, however, proposes no new steps.
One of the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it would be up to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo whether to make such a ""legal"" designation in the future and did not rule out the possibility.
A declaration of genocide by the U.S. government, which has only gone as far as labeling the crackdown ""ethnic cleansing,"" could have legal implications of committing Washington to stronger punitive measures against Myanmar. This has made some in the Trump administration wary of issuing such an assessment.
The International Criminal Court last week said it had begun an examination of whether the alleged forced deportations of Rohingya could constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity.
Asked whether the new U.S. findings could be used to bolster such international prosecution, the State Department official said no decision had been made on seeking ""judicial accountability"" over the Rohingya crisis.
The Trump administration, which has been criticized by human rights groups and some U.S. lawmakers for a cautious response to Myanmar, could now face added pressure to take a tougher stand.
Sarah Margon, director of the Washington office of Human Right Watch, said: ""What's missing now is a clear indication of whether the U.S. government intends to pursue meaningful accountability and help ensure justice for so many victims.""
The United States on Monday announced it was almost doubling its aid for displaced Rohingya Muslims in Bangladesh and Myanmar, with an extra $185 million.
""The stories from some refugees show a pattern of planning and pre-meditation,"" the report said, citing the military's confiscation in advance of knives and other tools that could be used as weapons.
About 80 percent of refugees surveyed said they witnessed a killing, most often by military or police, according to the report.
“Reports of mutilation included the cutting and spreading of entrails, severed limbs or hands/feet, pulling out nails or burning beards and genitals to force a confession, or being burned alive,"" the report said.
Later on Monday, the Public International Law and Policy Group, a Washington-based human rights law firm contracted by the State Department to conduct the refugee interviews, issued a companion report saying it provided 15,000 pages of documentation of ""atrocity crimes.""
The State Department’s investigation was modeled on a U.S. forensic examination of mass atrocities in Sudan's Darfur region in 2004, which led to a U.S. declaration of genocide that culminated in sanctions against the Sudanese government.
Any stiffer measures against Myanmar authorities could be tempered, though, by U.S. concerns about complicating relations between civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and the powerful military which might push Myanmar closer to China.
The U.S. government on Aug. 17 imposed sanctions on four military and police commanders and two army units but Myanmar’s military chief, Min Aung Hlaing, was spared. Further targeted sanctions have been under consideration, officials said earlier.
Min Aung Hlaing made his first public comments since the U.N. report in a military-run newspaper on Monday, saying that Myanmar abided by U.N. pacts but ""countries set different standards and norms"" and outsiders have ""no right to interfere"".

The Rohingya, who regard themselves as native to Rakhine state, are widely considered as interlopers by Myanmar's Buddhist majority and are denied citizenship.

612,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 11:48PM ET</span>",Trump's Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh rejects 'false accusations',"By Richard Cowan and Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh said on Monday he would not step aside after a second woman accused him of sexual misconduct decades ago, with President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans showing no signs of relenting in their push for his Senate confirmation. 
""The truth is I've never sexually assaulted anyone, in high school or otherwise,"" Kavanaugh said in an interview on Fox News Channel's ""The Story with Martha MacCallum,"" to air on Monday evening.
The allegations, dating back to the 1980s, have put in jeopardy Kavanaugh's chances of winning confirmation to the top U.S. court in a Senate narrowly controlled by Trump's party, with high-stakes congressional elections just weeks away.
Confirmation of the federal appeals court judge to the lifetime job would cement conservative control of the Supreme Court and advance Trump's goal of moving the high court and the broader federal judiciary to the right.
The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for Thursday for Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who last week accused him of sexual assault in 1982.
Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University in California, said Kavanaugh attacked her and tried to remove her clothing while he was drunk at a party when he was 17 years old and she was 15 when they were high school students in Maryland.
""I am not questioning and have not questioned that perhaps Dr. Ford at some point in her life was sexually assaulted by someone at some place, but what I know is I've never sexually assaulted anyone,"" Kavanaugh said in the Fox News interview.
He said he was not present at a party like the one described by Ford and noted that others Ford said were at the gathering had no recollection of it.
""I want a fair process where I can defend my integrity and I know I'm telling the truth. I know my lifelong record and I'm not going to let false accusations drive me out of this process. I have faith in God and I have faith in the fairness of the American people,"" Kavanaugh said. 
He said he ""did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter.""
'SMEAR CAMPAIGN'
A second woman, Deborah Ramirez, accused Kavanaugh in an article published in the New Yorker magazine on Sunday of sexual misconduct during the 1983-84 academic year when both attended Yale University.
Ramirez is cited by the New Yorker as saying Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken dormitory party.
Kavanaugh and his Republican allies portrayed the allegations as part of a ""smear campaign"" by Democrats who have fought his nomination from the outset.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made clear that, no matter what happened at the hearing, the full Senate would vote on Kavanaugh's confirmation.
""This fine nominee to the Supreme Court will receive a vote in this Senate in the near future,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor.
""Senate Democrats and their allies are trying to destroy a man's personal and professional life on the basis of decades-old allegations that are unsubstantiated and uncorroborated,"" he said.
Trump, himself accused during the 2016 presidential race of sexual misconduct with numerous women, twice offered words of support for Kavanaugh while in New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly.
""Judge Kavanaugh is an outstanding person. I am with him all the way,"" Trump said, calling the allegations politically motivated.
Ford's attorney Michael Bromwich sent a letter to the committee's Republican chairman, Senator Chuck Grassley, on Monday in which he objected to a plan by the panel's Republicans to hire an ""experienced sex crimes prosecutor"" to conduct the questioning at Thursday's hearing. Ford's attorneys have said their client wants senators to ask the questions.
""This is not a criminal trial for which the involvement of an experienced sex crimes prosecutor would be appropriate,"" Bromwich said.
Protesters opposing Kavanaugh's confirmation held rallies in Washington, New York, Philadelphia and elsewhere. Dozens were arrested in Senate office buildings. About 200 people gathered in front of the Supreme Court building in Washington, chanting: ""I believe Christine Ford.""
U.S. Capitol Police reported that 128 people were arrested on charges of unlawfully demonstrating in Senate office buildings.
The committee's top Democrat, Senator Dianne Feinstein, has called on Grassley to postpone Thursday's hearing in order to investigate Ramirez's accusations. 
The Kavanaugh controversy is unfolding just weeks before Nov. 6 congressional elections in which Democrats are trying to take control of Congress from Republicans, against a backdrop of the #MeToo movement fighting sexual harassment and assault.

Republicans, with a 51-49 Senate majority, can confirm Kavanaugh if they stay united. So far, no Republican senators have said they would vote against him.

613,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 11:20PM ET</span>","After chaotic day, Rosenstein stays in job but will meet with Trump","By Karen Freifeld and Sarah N. Lynch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 presidential election, will meet on Thursday to discuss whether Rosenstein will stay in his job.
Rosenstein had spent the weekend contemplating whether he should resign after a New York Times report last week said he had suggested secretly recording Trump in 2017, a source told Reuters.
The White House announced the meeting on Monday after a flurry of conflicting media reports about whether Rosenstein, a frequent target of Trump's anger, would be leaving the post. 
""At the request of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he and President Trump had an extended conversation to discuss the recent news stories,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Twitter.
Trump, who is in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, told reporters he would meet with Rosenstein on Thursday when he returns to Washington.
""We'll be meeting at the White House and we'll be determining what's going on,"" Trump said. ""We want to have transparency, we want to have openness, and I look forward to meeting with Rod at that time.""
The Rosenstein furor, kicked off by unconfirmed reports that he had verbally resigned, underscored the mounting tension in the White House over the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russia's role in the 2016 presidential election.
There had been widespread speculation that Trump would fire Rosenstein since Friday when a New York Times report said that in 2017 Rosenstein had suggested secretly recording the president and recruiting Cabinet members to invoke a constitutional amendment to remove him from office.
The Times said none of those proposals came to fruition. Rosenstein denied the report as ""inaccurate and factually incorrect.""
Shortly after the Times story, Trump told supporters at a rally in Missouri that there is ""a lingering stench"" at the Justice Department and that ""we’re going to get rid of that, too."" 
FATE OF INVESTIGATION
Rosenstein's departure would prompt questions about the future of Mueller's investigation and whether Trump, who has called the probe a ""witch hunt,"" would seek to remove Mueller. The investigation has resulted in indictments or guilty pleas from 32 people.
The Rosenstein furor came just six weeks ahead of the Nov. 6 congressional elections, and his removal could become an explosive political issue as Trump's fellow Republicans try to keep control of Congress.
Thursday's meeting between Trump and Rosenstein is set for the same day that Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who has accused him of sexual misconduct are scheduled to testify at a Senate hearing.
If Rosenstein resigns, Trump has more leeway on replacing him while firing him would make it harder for Trump to designate a successor.
Rosenstein's future ignited a series of conflicting reports on Monday, with the Axios news website cited an unidentified source with knowledge of the matter as saying he had verbally resigned to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. Other reports said Rosenstein expected to be fired while NBC News reported Rosenstein said he would not resign and the White House would have to fire him.
U.S. Treasury yields fell as much as 2 basis points after the Axios report, signaling investor concern but later pared losses. The S&P 500 also ticked down briefly but recovered most of its losses. 
Rosenstein has defended Mueller and been a target of Trump since he assumed supervision of the Russia investigation after his boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, recused himself because of his own contacts with Russia's ambassador to Washington while serving as a Trump campaign adviser became public.
Trump also has blasted Sessions frequently and said last week ""I don't have an attorney general.""
Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe said he was ""deeply concerned"" about the reports of Rosenstein stepping down, saying his departure would put the federal probe into Russian election activities at risk.
""There is nothing more important to the integrity of law enforcement and the rule of law than protecting the investigation of Special Counsel (Robert) Mueller,"" McCabe said in a statement.
McCabe was fired by Sessions in March after the Justice Department's internal watchdog accused him of misconduct. McCabe charged that he was targeted for being a witness into whether Trump tried to obstruct the probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
Rosenstein served for 12 years as the chief federal prosecutor in Maryland under both Democratic and Republican presidents before becoming deputy attorney general in April 2017.

Trump appointed him after firing Sally Yates, who served as deputy attorney general under Democratic former President Barack Obama and as acting attorney general under Trump. He dismissed her 10 days after taking office, after she refused to defend his executive order banning people from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.

The three countries refuted Venezuela's accusations that they were linked to the attack, which used drones carrying explosives during a military parade, in the latest spat between diplomatically isolated Caracas and Latin America.
Maduro showed a video of a young Venezuelan man, identified as Henryberth Rivas, who said in a televised broadcast on Monday night he participated in the drone attack against the president.
Rivas said in the video he was instructed by a fellow plotter after the attack to seek refuge at the Chilean embassy in Caracas, from where he was told he would be smuggled to the Mexican embassy, then to the Colombian embassy, and finally over the border to Colombia.
However, the Chilean embassy was closed and the plan fell through, Rivas said.
Maduro said: ""Today I can say we have convincing elements of the participation of Chilean, Colombian and Mexican diplomats in the protection of these people who undertook a terrorist act,"" said Maduro, who also showed a video of Rivas allegedly being arrested.

Maduro did not provide evidence of the embassies' alleged role. The Information Ministry did not respond immediately to a request for further information.
Government critics say Maduro frequently makes baseless accusations against ideologically opposed foreign nations in a bid to shift blame over Venezuela's salary-destroying hyperinflation, major food shortages, and rampant crime.
Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez said at the weekend Caracas had concluded that Chile, Colombia, and Mexico were involved in the attack.
All three countries refuted the accusations.
""Chile rejects the Venezuelan government's slanderous accusations that have no credibility to successfully distract from the very serious humanitarian situation in the country,"" Chile's Foreign Minister Roberto Ampuero told reporters on Monday.
Mexico's foreign ministry said it requested the presence of Venezuela's ambassador to Mexico, Maria Lourdes Urbaneja, to hand her a letter rejecting what it called the ""unfounded accusations.""

""Mexico's diplomats have at all times acted in accordance with international law and the Vienna Convention,"" the ministry said.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The remaining parties to the Iran nuclear deal on Monday agreed to keep working to maintain trade with Tehran despite skepticism this is possible as U.S. sanctions to choke off Iranian oil sales resume in November.
U.S. President Donald Trump decided in May to abandon the pact and to restore economic sanctions on Iran, including those that seek to force the OPEC member's major oil customers to stop buying Iranian crude.
In a statement after a meeting of Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and Iran, the group said they were determined to develop payment mechanisms to continue trade with Iran despite skepticism by many diplomats that this will be possible.
""Mindful of the urgency and the need for tangible results, the participants welcomed practical proposals to maintain and develop payment channels notably the initiative to establish a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to facilitate payments related to Iran's exports, including oil,"" the group said in a joint statement issued after the statement.
Several European diplomats said the SPV idea was to create a barter system, similar to one used by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, to exchange Iranian oil for European goods without money changing hands.
The idea is to circumvent U.S. sanctions due to be restored in November under which Washington can cut off from the U.S. financial system any bank that facilitates an oil transaction with Iran.
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the decision to set up such a vehicle had already been taken and that technical experts would meet again to flesh out the details.
""In practical terms this will mean that EU member states will set up a legal entity to facilitate legitimate financial transactions with Iran and this will allow European companies to continue to trade with Iran in accordance with European Union law and could be open to other partners in the world,"" she said.
Many diplomats and analysts, however, are skeptical such a vehicle could ultimately thwart U.S. sanctions given that the United States could amend its sanctions laws to prohibit such barter transactions.
""The key is to keep all possibilities open so that we can signal to the Iranians that the door isn't closing,"" said a senior French diplomat. 
The European Union, has so far failed to devise a workable legal framework to shield its companies from U.S. sanctions that go into effect in November and that, among other things, seek to choke off Iran's oil sales, diplomats said.
Highlighting how difficult it will be for the Europeans to come up with concrete solutions, French state-owned bank Bpifrance on Monday abandoned a plan to set up a financial mechanism to aid French firms trading with Iran.
The crux of the 2015 nuclear deal, negotiated over almost two years by the administration of former U.S. President Barack Obama, was that Iran would restrain its nuclear program in return for the relaxation of sanctions that had crippled its economy. 
Trump considered it flawed because it did not include curbs on Iran's ballistic missiles program or its support for proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq.

The impending return of U.S. sanctions has contributed to a slide in Iran's currency. The rial has lost about two-thirds of its value this year, hitting a record low against the U.S. dollar this month.

The government of President Daniel Ortega has alleged that Maradiaga financed the protests and trained protesters through a think tank he heads, the Institute of Strategic Studies and Public Policies.
""My conscience is clean. I've always been guided by justice, non-violence and integrity. Today I have more moral conviction than ever before,"" Maradiaga wrote on Twitter.
""Those of us who love Nicaragua and believe in liberty have the ethical obligation to continue firmly in this civic struggle,"" he added.
Maradiaga is currently not in Nicaragua.
About 300 people have been jailed since protests erupted in April, according to local human rights activists. More than 300 people were killed during those protests in crackdowns by Nicaraguan police and armed groups backing the government, human rights groups have said.
The protests began after Ortega's leftist government moved to reduce welfare benefits, but soon escalated into broader opposition against Ortega, who has been in office since 2007. He also held power in the 1980s during Nicaragua's civil war.

The current violence is the worst since his Sandinista government battled U.S.-backed ""Contra"" rebels in the 1980s.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The president of Honduras said on Monday cuts in U.S. support for Central America would hinder efforts to stem illegal immigration as he welcomed China's growing diplomatic presence in the region as an ""opportunity.""
In an interview, President Juan Orlando Hernandez expressed regret that prior U.S. commitments to step up investment in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador had been scaled back since his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump took office.
The U.S. president has pledged to build a wall along the Mexico-U.S. border to curb illegal immigration. The bulk of migrants stopped trying to cross the border are now from those three violent and impoverished Central American nations.
Since Trump became president, Hernandez said the United States had shown great willingness to work on combating street gangs known as maras that have menaced Central America. But it was less ready to support the region financially, he noted.
Under a scheme to strengthen Central America launched in 2014 known as the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle, the United States pledged to put forward a dollar for every four invested by Honduras, Hernandez said.
But that commitment has not materialized, he added.
""That will obviously have repercussions,"" he told Reuters. ""Because the whole idea of the Alliance for Prosperity ... was to attack the migration problem at the root.""
Between 2016 and 2018, combined U.S. foreign aid for Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador declined by more than one third to $195 million, according to official U.S. data.
Adding to the challenges facing the region, the Trump administration announced earlier this year it would end temporary immigration protection for tens of thousands of Hondurans and Salvadorans living in the United States.
Meanwhile, China is strengthening ties with Central America.
Last month, El Salvador broke off diplomatic relations with Taiwan in favor of China, citing economic reasons and following on the heels of Panama in 2017.
Honduras is one of a dwindling number of countries that still has formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
Hernandez said China's growing diplomatic presence posed a ""quandary"" for the region, but also ""an opportunity for all,"" provided there are ""clear rules."" Other countries would likely follow the lead of El Salvador and Panama soon, he added.
""We see that things are changing in Central America. I think the United States has been a bit late to see it,"" he said.
When asked whether Honduras would switch to China, the president gave a careful answer on what the future held.
""We're still with Taiwan. Each country follows the principle of self-determination, that it can make its own decisions,"" he said. ""For the time being, we're betting on a commercial relationship with Taiwan, a window to enter the Asian market.""

A crucial test of whether Washington was prepared to reaffirm its commitment to the region would be a meeting planned for mid-October with officials from the United States, the Central American nations and Mexico, Hernandez said.

PYONGYANG (Reuters) - One of the first things any traveler to North Korea notices is a huge portrait of Kim Il Sung, pictured in front of an airplane and workers alongside the road as you drive out of Pyongyang International Airport. It's an image that soon becomes very familiar.
Millions of portraits, mosaics and paintings of Kim Il Sung, founder of North Korea, and his son Kim Jong Il, the father of current leader Kim Jong Un, offer daily reminders to the public of the central role of the Kim dynasty in their nation's story.
Smiling images of the Kims are everywhere you go. Portraits are mandatory not just in public places like train stations, hospitals, schools and factories, but even in private spaces such as the living rooms of apartments.
Portraits must be hung high, so that no one can stand above the leaders, according to government minders who accompany visiting media and tourists.
As the night falls over Pyongyang, giant portraits on various buildings get lit up.
North Korea remains one of the most tightly controlled societies on earth, with most of the country closed to outsiders, but groups of tourists are allowed to visit Pyongyang and a few other sites, providing the impoverished country with one of its few remaining sources of foreign currency.
For those visitors, another reminder of the all-encompassing influence of the Kim family is the lapel badge, bearing the image of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, worn by all North Korean citizens.
The badge is presented to every North Korean when he or she turns 12, and from then on they are required to wear it whenever they leave their home. The badges are considered sacred and are not for sale, say government minders.
""We, all North Koreans, always wear the portrait badge like this. The most important part of a human body is the heart, right?"" said An Sol Yong, a music teacher at a teacher training college in Pyongyang, during a government organized visit for foreign reporters. All her students wore the badges pinned to their white shirts. 

""Being together with our dear leaders through a badge hung on the closest place from our heart means that our belief that we won't be alive if the great leaders had not existed is kept in all our hearts.""

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Fernando Haddad, the presidential candidate for Brazil's leftist Workers Party (PT), is closing the gap with poll-leading far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro for an Oct. 7 first-round vote and would beat him in a runoff, a survey released Monday showed.
Bolsonaro held steady at 28 percent of voter approval in the first round as compared to the same Ibope poll released last week. Haddad gained three percentage points to hit 22 percent, according to the survey, released by the Estado de S.Paulo newspaper and the Globo TV network.
In the likely scenario of a runoff vote, required by law if no candidate wins a majority in the first ballot, Haddad has 43 percent compared to Bolsonaro's 37 percent. Last week, Ibope showed the pair were tied with 40 percent each.
Brazil's election is one of the most turbulent seen since the country's return to democracy three decades ago, coming after over four years of unprecedented graft investigations revealed stunning levels of political corruption. That has fanned voter disdain toward the political class, adding to the frustrations of an economy that continues to sputter.
Bolsonaro, 63, has campaigned as the man who will sweep away political corruption and stop the return of the PT, which many blame for Brazil's recent recession, its worst in decades.
Haddad, 55, a former Sao Paulo mayor, has presented himself as a moderate and is hoping to draw the votes of supporters of Lula, who is still Brazil's most popular politician despite being in jail for corruption and barred from running for office.
Bolsonaro has been hospitalized since he survived a Sept. 6 assassination attempt, when an assailant stabbed him during a street campaign rally. Bolsonaro has said he will not return to campaigning before the first-round vote. 
The poll showed Bolsonaro had the highest rejection rate, at 46 percent, which could work against him in a runoff. Haddad had a 30 percent rejection rate, indicating his support had room to grow.
Center-left candidate Ciro Gomes was flat at 11 percent in the Ibope poll, and the favorite of investors, Geraldo Alckmin, was at 8 percent. Environmentalist Marina Silva has 5 percent.

The poll, which interviewed 2,506 people on Saturday and Sunday, had a margin of error of two percentage points.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.N. agency that supports Palestinian refugees said schools and health centers are at risk if it is unable to plug a $185 million funding gap needed to keep operating until the end of the year, the agency's head said on Monday.
""Currently we have money in the bank ... will last I presume somewhere into ... mid October,"" said Pierre Krahenbuhl, Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in New York, where world leaders are attending the annual U.N. General Assembly.
""But it's clear that we still need approximately $185 million to be able to ensure that all of our services, education system, health care, relief and social services and our emergency work in Syria and Gaza in particular can continue until the end of the year,"" Krahenbuhl said.
The United States last month announced a halt in its aid to UNRWA, calling it an ""irredeemably flawed operation"", a decision that further heightened tensions between the Palestinian leadership and the Trump administration.
UNRWA provides services to about 5 million Palestinian refugees across Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank and Gaza. Most are descendants of some 700,000 Palestinians who were driven out of their homes or fled fighting in the 1948 war that led to Israel's creation.
The growing refugee count was cited by Washington, UNRWA's biggest donor, in its decision to withhold funding.
Nikki Haley, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, has been critical of the U.N.'s count of Palestinian refugees. She has also questioned the ""right of return"" to Israel, claimed by the Palestinians as part of any eventual peace settlement. 
""When you don't tackle the underlying causes of conflict, that's when you get 70 years of UNRWA, it's not UNRWA that perpetuates itself, it's because the refugee community is still there waiting for a political solution to address its situation,"" Krahenbuhl said on Monday.
Under Trump, Washington has taken a number of actions that have alienated the Palestinians, such as recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a reversal of longtime U.S. policy. It led to the Palestinian leadership boycotting Washington's peace efforts being led by Jared Kushner, Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law.
Krahenbuhl compared the Palestinian refugee ""right of return"" issue with those of Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar who have fled into Bangladesh and the return of Bosnian Muslim refugees to areas under Serb control in the 1990s.

""So the only question one should ask is why should Palestine refugees be the one community where this question is not a justified question,"" Krahenbuhl said.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he expected a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to be announced ""pretty soon"" but that the location had yet to be determined.
Trump, during a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the United Nations, said: ""Chairman Kim has been really very open and terrific, frankly. I think he wants to see something happen.""
Moon met with Kim for a third time last week. He said brought Trump a personal message from the North Korean leader saying he was hoping to meet with the U.S. president again soon. 
Trump and Kim met for an unprecedented summit on June 12, and Trump has been keen on a second meeting, even though some U.S. officials and most analysts say Pyongyang has yet to show it is prepared to give up a nuclear arsenal that threatens the United States.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a news briefing earlier on Monday he hoped to travel back to North Korea before the end of the year to make final preparations for a second summit, which he said he was ""confident"" would happen.
""I expect I’ll be traveling to Pyongyang before too long,"" he said.
Asked if that would be before the end of the year, he replied: ""Yes. Lord willing, I’ll be traveling before the end of the year.""
Pompeo said he was optimistic that Kim would deliver on his pledge to denuclearize, but this would take time.
""We’re bringing the two senior leaders, the individuals who can actually make the decisions that will move this process forward, bring them together so we can continue to make progress towards what the U.N. Security Council has demanded and what Chairman Kim has promised he would do.
""That’s the effort. There remains work to be done. There will be some time before we get to complete denuclearization for sure."" 
At last week's meeting with Moon, Kim promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex - if the United States took ""corresponding action.""
However, while appearing to set a positive tone, the commitments fell far short of Washington's demands for a complete inventory of North Korea's weapons programs and irreversible steps toward denuclearization.
The mood though is sharply changed from that at last year's U.N. General Assembly, when Trump threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea and mocked the North Korean leader as ""Rocket Man"" on a ""suicide mission."" 
North Korea's representative to the meeting, Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, responded to Trump's U.N. remarks last year by calling them ""the sound of a dog barking"" and warning that North Korea could detonate a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific.

Pompeo has proposed a meeting with Ri at the General Assembly this week. U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said last week the two had agreed to meet but said the meeting could take place later.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Monday he was seeking a way ahead for military ties with China after Beijing postponed military talks in protest at last week's U.S. decision to impose sanctions over China's purchase of Russian weaponry.
Mattis traveled to China in June in an attempt to deepen military-to-military dialogue with Beijing, even as Sino-U.S. trade tensions climb and anxiety in Washington grows over China's modernization of its armed forces and its increasingly muscular military posture in the South China Sea. 
""We believe that we do have to have a relationship with China and Secretary (of State Mike) Pompeo and I are of one mind on this,"" Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon.
""And so we're sorting out the way ahead right now.""
China's Defence Ministry has said it would recall navy chief Shen Jinlong from a visit to the United States and postpone planned talks in Beijing between Chinese and U.S. military officials that had been set for next week.
It added that China's military reserved the right to take further countermeasures.
At the Pentagon, Lieutenant Colonel Dave Eastburn confirmed that the U.S. military had been informed that China's Navy chief would no longer meet America's top naval officer, Admiral John Richardson.
""We have no additional information at this time,"" he said. On Thursday, the U.S. State Department imposed sanctions on China's Equipment Development Department, the branch of the military responsible for weapons procurement, after it engaged in ""significant transactions"" with Rosoboronexport, Russia’s main arms exporter.
The sanctions are related to China's purchase of 10 SU-35 combat aircraft in 2017 and S-400 surface-to-air missile system-related equipment in 2018, the State Department said.
The sanctions are aimed at Russia. They fall under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA, which was signed into law in 2017 to punish Russia for meddling in U.S. elections, aggression in Ukraine and involvement in Syria's civil war.

The mobile S-400 batteries, which include radars, a control system, and missiles with a range of up to 250 miles (400 km), were first deployed in Russia in 2007 and are considered Moscow's most effective defense against aircraft, missiles and drones.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The European union must negotiate a fair deal for Britain to leave the bloc and avoid at all costs it leaving with no deal, which would have a profound impact on countries like Hungary, its foreign minister said on Monday.
EU leaders were unanimous at a summit in Salzburg last week in saying British Prime Minister Theresa May's plan for partial membership of the EU's customs union for goods amounted to ""cherry picking,"" which the bloc had ruled out.
But some comments by European leaders were widely seen by British newspapers as insulting, especially a social media post by European Council President Donald Tusk of him and May captioned with him offering her cake with ""no cherries"".
Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto was more conciliatory, saying the European Commission was in part to blame for Britain's decision to leave the bloc given it had acted as a ""governor"" rather than respecting the people's views.
""We are certain that we need a deal. We have to avoid a situation without a deal by all efforts,"" said Szijjarto. ""I don't like this hard or soft categorisation of Brexit. Our approach is we need a fair deal that is mutually beneficial for both sides. We must avoid a situation where there is no free trade agreement between Britain and the EU.""
Szijjarto said the implications of a no-deal and reverting to World Trade Organisation rules would be devastating for commerce and extremely harmful to a country like Hungary that relies heavily on British investment.
He said it also made no sense to discard Britain from key security arrangements or projects like the European Union's Galileo space program.
""Excluding them from these operations causes more harm on the European side than we would imagine ... A (Brexit) deal is a must,” he said.
Hungary's relationship with the EU has been tense recently.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who won a third consecutive four-year term in April on an anti-immigration platform, has repeatedly clashed with the bloc's institutions over issues ranging from tough migration policy to curbs on media freedom.
The European Parliament voted on Sept. 12 to sanction Hungary for flouting EU rules on democracy, civil rights and corruption in an unprecedented move.
""It's obvious that these debates are because the European institutions would like to carry out revenge on Hungary because of the migration issue,"" Szijjarto said.
Despite those differences, he said it made no sense for Hungary to leave the EU given its economic reliance on the bloc, but that Budapest wanted to see changes as the EU was moving away from its heritage.

""We understand clearly that there is an attempt to change the composition of the European population and a clear attempt to move the European Union to a post-national and post-Christian period and this is something that we don't want,"" he said.

LIVERPOOL, England (Reuters) - Britain's main opposition Labour Party is preparing to vote against any deal Prime Minister Theresa May clinches with the EU as it is increasingly unlikely to meet the tests Labour has set out, its Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer will say on Tuesday.
With just over six months until Britain leaves the European Union, May has yet to reach a deal with Brussels on the terms of the divorce, and her plan for future trade ties has been rebuffed by both the EU and many lawmakers in her own party.
Labour has listed six tests it would apply to any Brexit deal, including whether it ensured a strong future relationship with the EU and delivered the same benefits Britain has as a current member of the bloc's single market and customs union.
""If Theresa May brings back a deal that fails our tests – and that looks increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No 'ifs', no 'buts',"" Starmer will say in a speech to the party's annual conference, according to advance extracts.
""And if the prime minister thinks we'll wave through a vague deal asking us to jump blindfolded into the unknown she can think again... We will vote down a blind Brexit.""
Starmer will say the Conservative government does not have a credible plan for Brexit, and that there is no majority in parliament for May's so-called 'Chequers' proposals, which envisage close ties with the EU in the trade of goods.
Labour could play a deciding role in whether any Brexit deal is approved by parliament. May has a working majority of just 13 in the 650-seat parliament and a former junior minister said this month as many as 80 of her own lawmakers are prepared to vote against a Brexit deal based on her Chequers proposals.
Labour published a document measuring the government's progress against each of the tests which showed it was on course to fail all six. It said May needed to adopt a Brexit strategy that put the economy and jobs first.
Labour's conference will vote later on Tuesday on keeping a second Brexit referendum as an option if May fails to get her Brexit plan through parliament, heaping pressure on a struggling prime minister.
""Labour seem determined to take us all back to square one by rejecting a deal out of hand then trying to delay Brexit and re-run the referendum,"" junior Brexit minister Robin Walker said in a statement.

""Labour promised to respect the referendum result, but are just playing political games and trying to frustrate it.""

U.N.-mandated investigators have said the military carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Rohingya with ""genocidal intent."" Myanmar rejected the findings as ""one-sided"" and said it was a legitimate counterinsurgency operation.
""The military are at fault, the fact finding mission came out and gave clear examples of what's happened,"" Haley told reporters on Monday as she left a ministerial meeting in New York on the sidelines of the annual U.N. gathering of world leaders. ""These weren't terrorists. This was the military that did this to them. These people just want a place to live.""
The Myanmar mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment after the meeting. 
A U.S. government investigation report, reviewed by Reuters, has found that the military waged a planned, coordinated campaign of mass killings, gang rapes and other atrocities against the Rohingya, but it stopped short of describing the crackdown as genocide or crimes against humanity.
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian hosted the closed-door ministerial meeting on the crisis, which diplomats said focused on accountability.
""It's time for the international community to move. I did also request the French and the British that I think we need to bring the fact finding mission and have that reported in the Security Council,"" Haley said.
She said the United States would give an extra $185 million in humanitarian aid, of which $156 million would go to refugees and host communities in Bangladesh, taking its total for the crisis to nearly $389 million in the past year. 
Haley had said last week that U.S. President Donald Trump would ""lay down a marker"" on U.S. foreign aid during his speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday and that Washington would not be generous to countries ""that try and stop the U.S. or say they hate America.""
About 16 countries plus the EU and top U.N. officials attended the meeting in New York on Monday, diplomats said. 
""It was a constructive meeting, but let's see,"" Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Pororashtrya Montri told Reuters, adding that the U.N. report should be the basis for accountability. 
Hunt visited Myanmar last week and said the government must ensure there is ""no hiding place"" for those responsible for crimes. Myanmar's army chief on Monday warned against foreign interference.

The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has begun examining allegations of forced deportation of Rohingya to Bangladesh. Myanmar has said it wants to repatriate Rohingya who fled.

The workers - one Burkinabe, one South African and one Indian - set off for the capital Ouagadougou from the remote Inata mine, about 200 km (125 miles) away, on Sunday morning before losing contact with colleagues, said a security officer at the mine who asked not to be named. 
An official at Balaji Group told Reuters: ""It is true that three people were kidnapped.
""The authorities are working on it but we don't have the details of that yet,"" he added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The security officer said attempts to contact the workers had been in vain. He was unable to provide further details. 
It was not clear who was responsible for the disappearance. Jihadist groups have become increasingly active in northern Burkina Faso in recent years, mirroring a wider proliferation in the arid Sahel region of jihadist groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State. 
South Africa's International Relations and Cooperation Ministry said it was working with law enforcement on an ""incident"" but did not provide more detail. 
The Indian Consulate in Burkina Faso did not respond to a request for comment.

Last week, official experts recommended prioritizing high-skilled migrant workers after Brexit and that there should be no preferential treatment for workers from the European Union, proposals that worried some business leaders.
The FT said that while ministers backed the experts' proposals at a meeting on Monday, the idea of giving no preferential treatment to EU workers could change if or when Britain agrees a trade deal with the EU, the FT said.
""That would mean a better deal on migration, but the same offer would be available if we struck trade deals with other countries around the world,"" the newspaper quoted a source as saying.

The support of the PDCI party of former President Henri Konan Bedie was critical to Ouattara's run-off victory in the 2010 presidential election and his re-election in 2015.
""The political bureau has decided to withdraw,"" from the coalition, said PDCI spokesman Narcisse N'Dri.
A recent rift, exacerbated in part by a Ouattara cabinet reshuffle in July, strained relations and put the coalition at risk ahead of local elections next month and a presidential election in 2020. 
It also threatens to aggravate instability in Ivory Coast, where a tenuous stability has held since a brief civil war in 2010-11 that killed 3,000 people. Since then the economy has grown rapidly.
Now, Bedie is looking for other allies, which could weaken Ouattara's RDR party further. 

""The Political Bureau mandates President Bedie, to start negotiations for the establishment of a platform for collaboration with Ivorians who share his vision of a reconciled and peaceful Ivory Coast,"" N'Dri said.

Officer Amber Guyger had been dismissed after nearly five years on the job for her actions on the night of the shooting earlier in September, Dallas Police Chief U. Renee Hall said in a statement. Hall also said Guyger had engaged in ""adverse conduct"" when she was arrested for manslaughter, without elaborating.
Guyger, 30, had been on administrative leave since she fatally shot Botham Jean, 26. The killing of an unarmed black man by a white officer sparked protests in the Texas city, with many calling for the officer to be fired and charged with murder.
The decision to fire Guyger came after an internal review. Guyger can appeal the decision, police said. An attorney for the officer was not immediately available for comment.
Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said he heard the calls to take action and supported the decision.
""The swift termination of any officer who engages in misconduct that leads to the loss of innocent life is essential if the Dallas Police Department is to gain and maintain the public trust,"" he said in a statement.
A funeral for Jean was planned for Monday in his native Saint Lucia, Dallas media reported.
S. Lee Merritt, an attorney for the Jean family, said the police chief informed the family of the department's decision on Sunday night and they supported the move. 
""The Jean family said that this was an initial victory but are still focused on the proper indictment by the grand jury of murder, a successful prosecution and an appropriate sentence,"" he said in an interview. The family is also considering suing the department and the city, he said.
The case is before a grand jury. District Attorney Faith Johnson said the panel may decide to uphold the manslaughter charge on which Guyger was arrested, or it could consider a more serious charge of murder.
Police said Guyger has told investigators she mistook Jean's residence for her own and shot him, believing he was an intruder.

Guyger said she had mistakenly gone to Jean's apartment one floor above her own and managed to enter because the door was slightly ajar, according to an arrest warrant affidavit.

The Israeli military said thousands had taken part in the demonstration, throwing burning tires, rocks and explosive devices toward the troops on the other side of the border fence. Soldiers responded with riot dispersal means according to rules of engagement, a military spokesman said.
Gaza health officials said 90 people were hurt, 10 of them by live fire. Since Gazans began holding border protests on March 30, the Israeli army has killed 184 Palestinians. A Gaza sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Israel accuses Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement that controls Gaza, of having deliberately provoked violence in the protests, a charge Hamas denies.
Protest organizers say the demonstrations aim to press demands for a right to lands lost to Israel in the 1948 war of its foundation and for an end to an Israeli-Egyptian blockade of the coastal Gaza Strip.
Israel says the blockade is intended to prevent weapons from reaching militant groups, including Hamas, which it designates as a terrorist organization and with whom it has fought three wars in the past decade. 
More than 2 million Palestinians are packed into tiny Gaza, which is experiencing deep economic hardship.

Around 10 Palestinian boats sailed off the coast to challenge the blockade on Monday, drawing warning shots from the Israeli navy. There were no reports of Palestinian casualties.

It was unclear if there were any casualties.
President Salva Kiir signed a peace agreement with rebel factions to end a civil war that has killed at least 50,000 people, displaced 2 million and limited the country's development since it gained independence seven years ago.
Lam Tungwar, state Minister of Information in Liech state, formerly part of Unity State, said fighters belonging to the main rebel SPLM-IO force loyal to former vice president Riek Machar had attacked government positions in a small village in Koch County.
He said the attack occurred while the government was carrying out exercises aimed at integrating various fighters with the army in the areas under their control.
""They were attacked by the forces loyal to Riek Machar,"" Tungwar told Reuters. ""We are still receiving details of casualties if there were any.""
Machar's SPLM-IO in turn said government troops had attacked their positions in the same region on Monday afternoon.
""They made a coordinated attack on our defensive positions of Mirmir, Ngony and Koch. The architect of this attack is Gen. Peter Dor Manjur and the pro-government militias that they mobilized recently,"" SPLM-IO deputy military spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel said, adding that the fighting was still going on.
South Sudan plunged into warfare two years after independence from Sudan in 2011 when a political dispute between Kiir and Machar erupted into armed confrontation.
A previous peace deal signed in 2015 fell apart a year later after clashes broke out between government forces and rebels.
Machar and other insurgent factions signed the latest agreement with the Juba government after assurances that a power-sharing accord would be honored. The deal, mediated by Sudan, reinstates Machar to his former role as vice-president.

637,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 02:11PM ET</span>",Russia to give Syria S-300 air defense after accusations against Israel,"By Polina Nikolskaya and Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Monday it would supply an S-300 surface-to-air missile system to Syria in two weeks despite strong Israeli objections, a week after Moscow accused Israel of indirectly causing the downing of a Russian military jet in Syria.
The White House said it hoped Russia would reconsider the move, which U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton called a ""significant escalation"" of Syria's seven-year war.
Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said Moscow had in the past obliged Israel by refraining from providing Syria with the S-300. But last week's crash, which killed 15 Russian service members, had forced Russia to take ""adequate retaliatory measures"" to keep its troops safe.
""A modern S-300 air defense missile system will be transferred to the Syrian armed forces within two weeks,"" he said. The system will ""significantly increase the Syrian army's combat capabilities,"" he said.
President Vladimir Putin discussed the decision by phone on Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Kremlin said.
Russia, which fights in Syria to support the government against rebels and militants, has said Syrian anti-aircraft batteries shot the IL-20 surveillance plane down by mistake shortly after Israeli jets hit a nearby target. Moscow accused Israel of creating dangerous conditions that caused the crash.
Israel, which has carried out air strikes in Syria many times during the war, said after the incident that it would work to improve ""deconfliction"" of its missions with Russian forces, but would not halt them. 
Israel has long lobbied Moscow not to provide the S-300 to Syria, fearing this would hinder its aerial capability to strike build-ups of Iranian and Hezbollah forces in Syria.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Putin on Monday that supplying advanced weapon systems to ""irresponsible players"" would heighten dangers in the region, according to Netanyahu's office.
""Responsibility for the unfortunate incident lies with the Syrian army, which downed the plane, and Iran, whose aggression destabilises (the region),"" Netanyahu's statement said. Iranian forces are in Syria to support the government in the war. 
In the phone call, Netanyahu also said he told Putin that Israel would continue to protect its security and interests. The Israeli leader also agreed with Putin on continued coordination between the two countries' armed forces. 
Amos Yadlin, a former head of Israeli military intelligence, tweeted that the Russian accusation Israel was to blame for the Russian plane being shot down was ""fake news...meant to assuage diplomatic pressures and cloud the responsibility of Syrian and Russian officers for downing the plane.”
""Supplying S-300 increases risk by unprofessional Syrian operators first and foremost to the Russian air force, to Israel, the United States and the coalition as well as to civil aviation,"" Yadlin said. ""Israel has been preparing for this threat for 20 years and will know how to handle it.""
ISRAEL HAMPERED
Originally developed by the Soviet military, the S-300 has since been modernized and made available in several versions with different capabilities. It fires missiles from trucks and is designed to shoot down military aircraft and short- and medium-range ballistic missiles.
Alexander Khramchikhin of the Moscow-based Institute of Military and Political Analysis said the S-300 could ""seriously affect Israel's ability to carry out its strikes in Syria"". Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center and a former colonel in the Russian army, said the S-300 would make Israel ""more careful in the vicinity of Russian assets"".
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters the decision to supply the weapons was not directed at any third country. 
""Russia needs to increase safety of its military and it should be clear for everyone,"" he said. But he also repeated Moscow's accusations that Israel was to blame for the plane's downing: ""No doubt that according to our military experts, deliberate action by Israeli pilots was the reason for the tragedy and this cannot but harm our (Russia-Israeli) ties.""
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's office said: ""President Putin held Israel responsible for bringing down the plane and informed President Assad that Russia will develop Syria's air defense systems.""
Bolton told reporters in New York: ""There shouldn’t be any misunderstanding here ... The party responsible for the attacks in Syria and Lebanon and really the party responsible for the shooting down of the Russian plane is Iran,"" he said.
Bolton said a political process was needed to end Syria's war but that Russia's plans with the S-300 made that difficult.

He said U.S. troops would stay active in Syria as long as Iran was involved. ""We’re not going to leave as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

The investment joins a list of past efforts to resolve the Mapuche conflict that mainly stems from a dispute over ancestral lands. Pinera's center-right government has promised to prioritize improving relations with the Mapuche.
The program aims to increase indigenous representation in the government and accelerate the creation of a ministry of indigenous people. Housing subsidies, infrastructure improvements and a dozen new hospitals for the Araucania region are also part of the plan, according to government materials. 
""It is not the final answer, it is a proposal that we hope can be analyzed and enriched by all of civil society,"" Pinera said in broadcast comments as he unveiled the plan. 
Around 600,000 Mapuche live in Chile, many in the forested, hilly provinces of Araucania and Bio Bio, roughly 400 miles (640 km) south of Santiago. The Mapuche accuse the state and private companies of taking their ancestral land, draining its natural resources, and using undue violence against them. Their communities are among the poorest in Chile.
In recent years, acts of arson against forestry companies and other industries, often attributed to some disgruntled Mapuche groups, have increased in the region.

LONDON (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday the attackers who killed 25 people at a military parade had been paid by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and that Iran would ""severely punish"" those behind the bloodshed.
The deputy head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards also accused the United States and Israel of involvement in the attack and said they should expect a devastating response.
In the southwestern city of Ahvaz, thousands packed the streets to mourn the victims of Saturday's assault, many chanting ""Death to Israel and America"". Twelve members of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were among the dead.
The coffins, wrapped in flags, were carried by mourners. Many held pictures of a four-year-old boy killed in the incident, one of the worst such attacks against Iran's most powerful military force.
Gunmen fired on a viewing stand in Ahvaz where officials had gathered to watch an annual parade marking the start of Iran's 1980-88 war with Iraq.
Fars and IRNA news agencies said on Monday five attackers were killed, not four as previously reported by state media. The body of the fifth assailant had not been identified as it was mixed up with other casualties, Fars said.
""Based on reports, this cowardly act was done by people who the Americans come to help when they are trapped in Syria and Iraq, and are paid by Saudi Arabia and the UAE,"" Khamenei said on his website.
Guards Brigadier General Hossein Salami, in a speech broadcast on state TV, said: ""You have seen our revenge before. You will see that our response will be crushing and devastating and you will regret what you have done.""
Tasnim news agency quoted Salami as saying the ""horrific crime"" exposed the dark side of an alliance that the United States, Saudi Arabia and Israel had created to counter Iranian influence in the region.
The secretary of Iran's National Security Council said Tehran needed to talk to its neighbors to avoid tensions.
""It's essential to be fully aware and increase our constructive dialogues to neutralize the plots of enemies who want to create suspicion and disagreement among regional countries,"" Ali Shamkhani said. 
He also said U.S. sanctions against Iran were illegal and President Donald Trump was using them as a tool for ""personal revenge"".
ANTAGONIZE
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, asked by a Fox News interviewer if the United States played any role in the attack, said: ""When you have a security incident at home, blaming others is an enormous mistake.""
The loss of innocent lives was tragic, Pompeo added. There has been no reaction from Saudi Arabia or Israel.
Accusations against Gulf countries will almost certainly antagonize Iran's regional foe Saudi Arabia. The oil super-powers are waging a war for influence across the Middle East, backing opposite sides in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon.
It is, however, highly unlikely the Guards will strike any of its foes directly and risk setting off a regional conflict.
Analysts said the violence has led to a boost in domestic support for the Guards which they could use to silence their critics, who include pragmatic President Hassan Rouhani.
Rouhani engineered Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that ushered in a cautious detente with Washington before tensions flared anew with Trump's decision in May to pull out of the accord and reimpose sanctions on Tehran.
Iran's Intelligence Minister, Mahmoud Alavi, said a network of suspects had been arrested in connection with the attack, the judiciary's news agency Mizan reported. He did not elaborate.. 
Karim Dahimi, a human rights activist in London, told Reuters local sources had said more than 300 people had been arrested in the cities of Ahvaz, Khorramshahr and Abadan in recent days, mostly from the Sunni Muslim community.
Ahvaz National Resistance, an Iranian ethnic Arab opposition movement which seeks a separate state in oil-rich Khuzestan province, and Islamic State have both claimed responsibility.
The Guard Corps was set up after the 1979 Islamic revolution to protect the Shi'ite clerical ruling system and revolutionary values. It answers to Ayatollah Khamenei and has an estimated 125,000-strong military with army, navy and air units.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Monday warned the United States against pursuing hostile policies toward Tehran, saying preventing Iran from exporting oil would be ""very dangerous"", though he did not rule out talks between the two countries.
In May, U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran and announced sanctions against the OPEC member. Washington is pushing allies to cut imports of Iranian oil to zero and will restore sanctions on Iran's oil sales in November.
Under the accord, most international sanctions against Tehran were lifted in 2016 in exchange for Iran curbing its nuclear program.
""Imposing sanctions on Iran to prevent us from selling our oil will be very dangerous ... and it cannot succeed,"" Iran's students News Agency ISNA quoted Rouhani as saying in a meeting with senior editors of foreign media in New York.
Rouhani, who is in New York for the annual United Nations General Assembly gathering of world leaders, said Iran would only talk to Trump if his administration proved its trustworthiness. Economic pressure would not force Tehran to the negotiating table, Rouhani said. 
""If Trump wants to talk to Iran, then he first should return to the nuclear deal,"" Rouhani said.
Foes for decades, Washington and Tehran have been increasingly at odds since May, with some U.S. officials privately calling for regime change in Iran. In July, Trump said he would be willing to meet Iran’s leader without preconditions to discuss how to improve ties. Iran dismissed the offer.
Iran's rial currency has lost half its value in the past few months and fear of economic hardship has led to sporadic protests in several cities, with ordinary Iranians chanting slogans against Iranian leaders.
Rouhani has sought to reassure Iranians, many deeply frustrated by high unemployment and low living standards, that Iran’s oil-reliant economy could withstand the U.S. pressure.
""The U.S. sanctions harms ordinary Iranians but also it puts pressure on foreign companies who have to withdrew from Iran's market, fearing America's sanctions,"" Rouhani said. 
Despite Iran’s fragile economy, weakened by decades of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement, it will be difficult for Rouhani to consider diplomacy with the United States, which is rejected by Iran's powerful hardliners.
""Rouhani cannot take such a risk because, after Trump's withdrawal from the deal, his hardline rivals are in a stronger position in Iran,"" said an Iranian official. 
European powers have scrambled to protect Iranian oil revenues and shield companies from the U.S. measures to keep them operating in Iran, but many firms have pulled out regardless.
Iran has threatened to withdraw from the nuclear accord unless European nations move to neutralize the consequences of Washington's exit.
""Iran will remain committed to the deal ... as long as other members remain committed to the pact and fulfill their promises,"" Rouhani said.
Some insiders said Rouhani holding talks with Trump would effectively kill the existing deal, which was championed by the Iranian president with the guarded backing of Iran's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

""Rouhani's political career is in danger if he talks to Trump because then the multinational nuclear deal will be out of the picture and Rouhani will lose the support of his European allies for ignoring them,"" said a senior Iranian official from Tehran.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union sued Poland on Monday in the EU's highest court over the ruling party's changes to the judiciary, which the bloc believes violate the independence of the courts.
""The European Commission maintains that the Polish law on the Supreme Court is incompatible with EU law as it undermines the principle of judicial independence, including the irremovability of judges,"" the EU's executive Commission said.
The new Polish law lowers the retirement age of Supreme Court judges from 70 to 65 years, putting 27 out of 72 sitting judges at risk of being forced to retire. The mandate of the head of the Supreme Court would be prematurely terminated. 
The Commission asked the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice to suspend the application of the law until it reaches a verdict to prevent the forced retirement of the judges and the appointment of new ones.
The Commission requested the injunction because the new Supreme Court judges are appointed by the National Council for the Judiciary, which, after the changes introduced by the ruling, eurosceptic PiS party, is composed of PiS-appointed nominees.
The loss of independence by the National Council for the Judiciary was the reason why Poland was suspended last week from the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary (ENCJ).
Poland's situation echoes that of Hungary, which the European Parliament sanctioned earlier this month for flouting EU rules on democracy, civil rights and corruption.
""Poland is ready to defend its legal and constitutional position before the ECJ,"" government spokeswoman Joanna Kopcinska told the Polish press agency PAP.
The Polish government said it would comment on the lawsuit once it gets the relevant documents from the Commission, but noted that only a binding ruling of the European Court of Justice could make it change legislation.
Diplomats in Brussels said Europe ministers of other EU countries would hold a hearing on Oct. 16 at which Warsaw would be asked to explain its actions on the judiciary. 

EU ministers held similar hearings in June and September, each time concluding that they were not satisfied with Poland's explanations.

NEW York (Reuters) - France said on Monday it wanted the U.N. Security Council to implement sanctions on militias involved in month-long clashes between rival factions in Libya's capital Tripoli, which has undermined U.N. efforts to hold elections by year-end.
At least 115 people have been killed and 383 injured in fighting that has pitted the Seventh Brigade, or Kaniyat, from Tarhouna, a town 65 km (45 miles) southeast of Tripoli, against the Tripoli Revolutionaries’ Brigades (TRB) and the Nawasi, two of the capital’s largest armed groups.
Tripoli and western Libya are run by a U.N.-backed government mainly supported by armed groups, while Eastern Libya is controlled by a rival administration. The country has been riven since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011.
""In the face of the worsening security situation in Tripoli, there is a responsibility to support the Libyans and that means we must be tougher on those that want to keep the status quo for their benefits,"" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian told reporters ahead of a meeting hosted by France on Libya on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.
He said recent sanctions taken at the U.N. against people traffickers in Libya should be extended in particular to the Tripoli militias.
The U.N. Security Council Libya sanctions committee blacklisted militia leader Ibrahim Jathran earlier in September, subjecting him to a global asset freeze and travel ban, after he oversaw an attack on oil facilities.
Some diplomats and analysts have said sanctions on individuals would have limited impact given those people rarely leave Libya.
Former colonial power Italy and France have been competing for influence in war-torn Libya, rich in oil and gas and a staging post for people smugglers who have launched tens of thousands of migrants across the Mediterranean sea toward Europe.
Paris has been pushing for an election to be held in Libya by the end of the year. The increasing violence has made the French initiative increasingly untenable. The idea was backed by four Libyan leaders in May and endorsed by the United Nations.
French diplomats acknowledged that the timeframe was becoming more difficult to keep, but hoped to give the process new momentum this week.
Two European diplomats said they believed Paris was slowly coming into line with Italy.
""France is pretty isolated on the elections and it's not just Franco-Italian but international community in general,"" said one of the diplomats.

""You can't,"" the official said, and with just six weeks until the next wave of U.S. sanctions hits Iran on Nov. 4, European diplomats acknowledge he was right.
The European Union has failed to design a workable legal shield for its companies in Iran to beat the global reach of the U.S. financial system and defy President Trump, the diplomats say. 
Instead, Europe is engaging with Russia and China to show that it is at least searching for ways to ensure Tehran gets some benefits from its oil sales so Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has a reason to keep to the accord, according to seven European officials and diplomats.
Facing a collapsing economy at home, Rouhani is in a bind as he addresses the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, pressed by hardliners to abandon the 2015 deal as its economic benefits evaporate.
EU-Iranian trade this year is running at 2 billion euros ($2.35 billion) a month, but this is expected to fall as big European companies pull out and Iranian oil exports are choked off by U.S. sanctions.
European heavyweights Peugeot,  Renault  (PA:RENA), Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) and Airbus are among companies that have pulled out of Iran since May, while Air France and British Airways have also now ended operations after falling traffic.
Denmark's A.P. Moller-Maersk will stop shipping Iranian oil.
The accord, signed in Vienna by the United States, France, Britain, Germany, China, Russia and Iran, lifted sanctions in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, designed to prevent the country from obtaining a nuclear bomb.
Trump says the deal, the biggest foreign policy achievement of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, failed to stop Iran's ballistic missile program, its nuclear activities beyond 2025 or its role in wars in Yemen and Syria.
Britain, France and Germany say abandoning the pact does not address U.S. security concerns and instead threatens stability in the Middle East. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons.
The U.S. Treasury is reimposing sanctions on Iran's energy, auto and financial sectors in two phases, starting this August.
The EU has tried to neutralize the U.S. penalties with measures such as euro-denominated finance lines and a law that could make it an offense for EU citizens to comply with U.S. sanctions. But these have not reassured companies that they would be protected against U.S. fines or risks to their U.S.-based activities if they did business in Iran, diplomats said.
""If you decide to do business with an enemy of the United States of America, you will not being doing it with the United States,"" said a U.S State Department official. ""You will not have access to the U.S. financial system.""
Americans diplomats say the anger that EU diplomats showed in their May meetings with State Department officials in Washington has faded. The Europeans are beginning to grudgingly accept their failure to shield European investment in Iran from U.S. sanctions, the American envoys in Europe say.
""When the sanctions really start to hurt at the end of the year, it will make it much harder because what we will have on the table won't be enough,"" said one senior European diplomat. 
COLD WAR REDUX
The European Commission's boldest idea is for European central banks to pay Iran directly for oil in euros and bypass the U.S. financial system. But it has so far proved too politically sensitive at both the European Central Bank and Germany's Bundesbank, two diplomats said. 
In Luxembourg, the European Investment Bank, the bloc's lending arm, rejected lending to EU companies in Iran for fear of jeopardizing its ability to raise money on U.S. markets.
Now Berlin, Paris, London and Brussels are working on a barter system once used by Moscow during the Cold War to exchange Iranian oil for European goods without money changing hands, using a so-called special purpose vehicle - a company set up to handle the business.
Such a system could appeal to Asian countries that purchase Iranian oil, such as India, which had contacted Brussels about avoiding U.S. sanctions. But diplomats say its complexity is evidence that the European powers are cornered. 
""It's very complicated and I think it would only work in a limited way,"" a senior European diplomat said on condition of anonymity because the discussions are confidential.
Another European diplomat echoed that, saying: ""By the end of the year, we hope to have some of these (proposals) in place and by then we'll have seen November 4 pass and only then we will see whether what we can do will have any impact."" 
In a sign of the obstacles, the European Union's focus has also shifted to the longer term to try to overcome a perception that European policy is held hostage by the U.S. treasury.
Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has proposed promoting the euro as a global currency to challenge the dollar, potentially allowing oil to be priced on world markets in euros. But economists said that China has sought a global role for its renminbi currency for years without success.
""There should be no illusion that we are talking about slow, tectonic changes,"" said Nicolas Veron, an economist at Brussels-based think-tank Bruegel. 
EUROPEAN 'SWIFT'?
The European Commission had also been in talks with Japan to avoid U.S. measures, but Tokyo looks set to stop importing Iranian crude by mid-October after the United States ruled out granting waivers from sanctions to any country.
Meanwhile, the United States is pressing to cut Iran out of the Belgian-based SWIFT global payment network that facilitates the bulk of the world's cross-border money transactions, as it was in 2012 before the nuclear deal.
Although the United States does not hold a majority on SWIFT's board of directors, the Trump administration could threaten to sanction bankers working at there, diplomats said.
""If you threaten maximum pressure, then it implies no waivers, no softening of the position, no loopholes so it’s only a matter of time,"" said a senior French official.
Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas in August called for a SWIFT-style system independent of Washington, but officials say that is another longer-term, complex project to consider.
Through what one Western official called ""strategic messaging"", Europe hopes that by showing Tehran that capitals are working intensively on measures to keep European investment flowing into Iran, the Islamic Republic will stick to the terms of the nuclear accord and avoid doing anything rash.
""I think that the symbolism is the most important thing at this point,"" said Sanam Vakil, a senior associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based international think tank.
Berlin, Paris and London ""don't have the political strength and time to be able to offer Iran anything serious or significant,"" she said.

The My Step Alliance, which includes Prime minister Nikol Pashinyan's Civil Contract Party, won 81.05 percent of the vote, Tigran Mukuchyan, the central election commission head, told a news conference on Monday.
That means its candidate Hayk Marutyan, a comedian who plays a harried father and shop owner on a sitcom on Armenian television, will become the mayor.
The election was held to replace Taron Margaryan, an influential member of the former ruling Republican Party, who resigned as mayor in July, two months after his party was ousted from national power.
Former opposition leader Pashinyan became prime minister in May after the Republicans were toppled following weeks of mass protests against corruption and cronyism.
Several street protests were later held to demand the resignation of Margaryan, the mayor. The Republican Party did not participate in Sunday's election to replace him.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's populist government on Monday escalated its clampdown on irregular immigration with a decree aimed at slashing the number of people awarded asylum and doubling the time irregular migrants can be detained.
The legislation promoted by Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who leads the far-right League party, comes as boat arrivals plummet and the minister refuses to allow charity ships carrying rescued migrants to dock in Italy's ports.
""This is a step toward making Italy safer,"" Salvini tweeted.
The League, which took power in June in coalition with the 5-Star Movement, has promised to deport hundreds of thousands of irregular migrants. Already, the move to refuse to let rescue boats dock has proven popular, doubling opinion poll support for the League since the election in March to more than 30 percent.
The Salvini Decree aims to limit the use of a form of international protection that has been widely used in recent years but is not strictly tied to political persecution or war.
""Humanitarian"" asylum was given to more than 20,000 people last year, or 25 percent of those who sought asylum, against the 16 percent of asylum seekers awarded one of the other two forms of international protection.
It is given to migrants who are deemed to have ""serious reasons"" to flee their home country - a category that has often included homosexuals fleeing harsh anti-gay laws in Africa.
The decree limits humanitarian protection to victims of domestic violence, trafficking, work exploitation and natural disasters, to those needing urgent medical care, and to people who carry out ""particularly valuable civic acts"", Salvini said.
""Humanitarian protection was supposed to be used sparingly,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told reporters. ""In Italy, there has been an indiscriminate reception (of migrants) and the rules helped support this.""
MIGRATION PACKAGED WITH SECURITY
Other immigration measures include extending to 180 days from 90 the time an irregular migrant can be detained before being freed, to give the state more time to complete the deportation procedure.
The decree would also widen the range of criminal offences that trigger the stripping of asylum privileges applied for or already granted.
Such a move could fall foul of the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention, which is intended to protect all refugees, whether formally recognized or not, from being forcibly returned, except where they are a danger to public safety or national security.
Before the government approved the draft decree, a source in President Sergio Mattarella's office had said parts of it might be unconstitutional - which could open the way for Mattarella to block it 
The new immigration guidelines were packaged together with new security rules in an emergency decree, which has 60 days to secure parliamentary approval. Salvini said parliament was likely to make changes. 
The security measures include heightened controls on those who rent trucks, in response to a series of attacks in Europe aimed at causing mass casualties. It also foresees stripping naturalized foreigners who are convicted on terrorism charges of their Italian citizenship.
The head of the Italian Catholic bishops' conference, Nunzio Galantino, on Sunday criticized the decision to link immigration and security in the same piece of legislation, saying:

""We cannot consider the immigrant's condition to be automatically that of a criminal.""

Western Libya is the main departure point for Europe-bound migrants fleeing poverty and conflict, although many drown in the attempt. 
The coast guard rescued 190 migrants on board two inflatable boats off the port of Khoms, Naval forces spokesman Ayoub Qassem told Reuters. A group of 45 others were picked up on board a wooden boat about 50 miles (80 kms) off Zuwarah.
They included 20 women and two children, the source said.
The number of crossings has sharply dropped since July 2017 when an armed group expelled human traffickers from a smuggling hub after an Italy-backed deal.
Aquarius 2, the one charity rescue vessel still operating in the central Mediterranean, has had its registration revoked by the Panama Maritime Authority in a move that means there will be no charity rescue ships off the Libyan coast in the near future unless the vessel can find a new flag to sail under.
Tripoli and western Libya are run by a U.N.-backed government mainly supported by armed groups, while eastern Libya is controlled by a rival administration. The country has been riven by conflict since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011.

649,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>",Some 129 countries sign up to Trump's pledge at U.N. to fight drugs,"By Michelle Nichols and Jeff Mason
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Some 129 countries at the United Nations signed on to a U.S.-drafted pledge to fight the global drug problem on Monday that U.S. President Donald Trump warned presented a public health and national security threat. 
In order to attend the brief U.N. event with Trump, countries had to sign the one-page ""call to action on the world drug problem."" Trump held a similar event at the annual gathering of world leaders in New York last year, focused on U.N. reform. 
Trump, who has long been wary of the value of the United Nations, noted on Monday that the world body's ""potential is being met, slowly but surely, it's being met.""
Countries signing the nonbinding U.S. statement pledged to develop national action plans to reduce demand for illicit drugs through education, expand treatment efforts, strengthen international cooperation on justice, law enforcement and health, and cut off the supply by stopping production.
""If we take these steps together, we can save the lives of countless people in all corners of the world,"" Trump said in brief remarks. 
""Illicit drugs are linked to organized crime, illegal financial flows, corruption and terrorism. It's vital for public health and national security that we fight drug addiction and stop all forms of trafficking and smuggling that provide the financial lifeblood for vicious transnational cartels,"" he said. 
Among countries that did not sign the U.S. drugs pledge was New Zealand. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern noted that the United States itself was particularly focused on tackling opioids.
""We have a number of challenges that are quite specific to New Zealand and the particular drugs that are present, but also on taking a health approach. We want to do what works and so we're using a strong evidence base to do that,"" Ardern told reporters on Sunday. 
Addiction to opioids - mainly prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl - is a growing U.S. problem, especially in rural areas. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were involved in more than 49,000 deaths in the country last year.
In March, Trump unveiled a plan to get tough on opioids, including cutting opioid prescriptions by changing federal programs, funding for other initiatives and stiffer sentencing laws for drug dealers.

He also suggested the death penalty for dealers, a proposal that has gained little support from drug abuse and judicial experts.

In his first public comments on the subject since a report by a U.N. fact-finding mission this month, Min Aung Hlaing said Myanmar abided by U.N. pacts, but warned that ""talks to meddle in internal affairs"" cause ""misunderstanding"".
""As countries set different standards and norms, any country, organization and group has no right to interfere in and make decision(s) over sovereignty of a country,"" Min Aung Hlaing said in comments reported in English on his website. 
The remarks, made during a trip to Myanmar's northeast on Sunday, were also published in a military-run newspaper on Monday.
A military spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.
The U.N. mission called for Min Aung Hlaing and five other generals to be prosecuted for crimes against humanity and genocide over allegations of mass killings and gang rapes.
A military crackdown unleashed in the western state of Rakhine last year after attacks by Rohingya militants on police and army posts drove more than 700,000 of the largely stateless minority across the border with Bangladesh.
Myanmar denied entry to the U.N. mission's investigators and rejected their findings, insisting that security forces conducted a legitimate operation to root out ""terrorists"".
In his remarks, Min Aung Hlaing referred to the Rohingya as Bengalis, suggesting they belong in Bangladesh, and said they must ""accept scrutiny"" under the country's 1982 Citizenship Law. 
The law limits citizenship for those, like the Rohingya, who are not members of officially decreed ethnic groups.
Elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi shares power with the military under a 2008 constitution written by the generals who ruled Myanmar for decades.

The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has begun examining the alleged forced deportation of Rohingya to Bangladesh. Myanmar has said it wants to repatriate Rohingya who fled.

But Budapest, which accuses Soros and the liberal groups and causes he backs of trying to destroy Europe's Christian culture by promoting mass migration, said it would not repeal the laws, whatever the outcome of the court appeal.
Under legislation named ""Stop Soros"", anybody who helps migrants not entitled to protection to apply for asylum, or helps illegal migrants gain status to stay in Hungary, can be jailed. Orban has also introduced a 25 percent special tax on aid groups it says support migration.
OSF said the ""Stop Soros"" legislation, approved by the Hungarian parliament in June, ""breaches the guarantees of freedom of expression and association enshrined in the European Convention of Human Rights and must be repealed"".
""The Hungarian government has fabricated a narrative of lies to blind people to the truth: that these laws were designed to intimidate independent civil society groups, in another step toward silencing all dissent,"" OSF president Patrick Gaspard said in a statement.
The provisions of the legislation are so broadly written that ""they will have a far-reaching and chilling effect on the work of civil society far beyond the field of migration,"" said the OSF statement.
""WILL OF THE HUNGARIAN PEOPLE""
Budapest responded with defiance to the OSF move.
""The government stands by the Stop Soros package of laws.... as the legislation serves the will of the Hungarian people, and the security of Hungary and Europe,"" a government spokesman told Reuters.
""The Soros organization attacks the Stop Soros package with all possible means as the legislation stands in the way of illegal immigration. The aim of George Soros and organizations supported by him is to flood Europe with migrants."" 
Hungarian-born Soros denies trying to promote mass migration into Europe from the Middle East and elsewhere. In May the OSF announced it would shut its office in Budapest after more than 30 years and move to Berlin.
Orban, who has been in power since 2010 and won a third consecutive term in April with a big majority, has increased his control over Hungary's media and courts and put allies in control of once independent institutions.

The legislation on asylum seekers has drawn condemnation from the U.N. refugee agency and the European Union. This month the European Parliament voted to sanction Hungary for flouting EU rules on democracy and civil rights.

OSLO (Reuters) - A Russian citizen detained in Oslo on suspicion of illegal intelligence activities is a Russian state employee but has denied wrongdoing, seeing the matter as a ""misunderstanding"", his Norwegian lawyer said on Monday.
The unidentified man was detained at Oslo airport before a flight out of the country on Friday, a day after attending a seminar on digitalization in Norway's parliament.
Police told Reuters he would be held for an initial two weeks due to the risk of destruction of evidence. 
The man's lawyer, Hege Aakre, told Reuters that her client regarded the incident as ""a misunderstanding"" and was cooperating with investigators to provide an explanation.
She said the detention was based on an observation of ""suspicious behavior"", declining to elaborate, and her client was considering taking his case to an appeals court.
The Russian Embassy in Oslo said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post that the man's detention was based on false claims under an ""absurd pretext."" It declined further comment.
The seminar was organized by the European Center for Parliamentary Research and Documentation (ECPRD) and attended by 79 people from 34 countries, Norwegian news agency NTB said.
Last December, retired Norwegian border guard Frode Berg was arrested in Moscow on suspicion of espionage and is awaiting trial. Berg admitted being a courier for Norway's military intelligence but had scant knowledge of the operation he took part in and denied wrongdoing, his lawyer said.
The lawyer, Brynjulf Risnes, said the detention of the Russian man in Oslo offered the hope of a prisoner swap. ""It sparks a hope for Berg and his family,"" he told Reuters.
Berg faces up to 20 years of imprisonment if found guilty.

Labour, which under socialist leader Jeremy Corbyn has shifted from a centrist pro-business platform to a more interventionist left-wing pitch, is using its annual conference to detail its plans to help a greater number of people to share in economic prosperity that it says is ""hoarded by the few"". 
Over the weekend the party announced plans to nationalize key industries and give workers a third of seats on company boards.
Labour finance spokesman John McDonnell will say that every company with more than 250 employees would have to create an ""Inclusive Ownership Fund"", transferring at least 1 percent of their shares into the fund every year, up to a maximum of 10 percent.
""The evidence shows that employee ownership increases a company's productivity and encourages long-term thinking,"" McDonnell will say on Monday in a speech to the Labour Party's conference in Liverpool, according to extracts released in advance.
""The shares will be held and managed collectively by the workers. The shareholding will give workers the same rights as other shareholders to have a say over the direction of their company, and dividend payments will be made directly to the workers from the fund.""
McDonnell cited the example of Germany, where workers sit on company boards, but the British Chambers of Commerce, a business lobby group, criticized Labour's plan, saying it would deter people from investing in Britain. 
""Let no one be fooled. Labour’s proposals are both a tax grab and an unprecedented overreach into the way many of our businesses are run,"" Adam Marshall said. 
""At a time of peak Brexit uncertainty, when Labour should be setting out how it will support business confidence and investment, it is announcing policies that would deliver the exact opposite.""
Under the plans, individuals' dividend payments would be capped at 500 pounds a year. 

The rest would be transferred back into public services in the form of a ""social dividend"" into a national fund that the plans envisage being worth 2.1 billion pounds by the end of the first term of a Labour government.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel admitted on Monday she had misjudged her response to allegations of far-right sympathies against Germany's spymaster, after resolving a row over his redeployment that threatened to pull her government apart.
BfV intelligence agency head Hans-Georg Maassen's political views came under the microscope this month after he questioned the authenticity of video footage showing radicals hounding migrants in the eastern city of Chemnitz.
Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), their Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) sister party and the third coalition partner - the center-left Social Democracts (SPD) - agreed last week to transfer Maassen to a senior role in the Interior Ministry.
But that prompted a public blacklash when it emerged that Maassen would also get a pay rise. The coalition rescinded the hike on Sunday, after some members of the SPD called for their party to quit the alliance if it stayed in place.
""I focused too much on functionality and processes in the interior ministry and not enough on what moves people, rightly, when they hear of someone's promotion,"" Merkel told reporters, a year to the day after an inconclusive national election consigned the country to six months of political limbo.
""I regret very much that that was allowed to happen... It is important that we now solve the problems of the people."" 
LIMPING ON
The dispute had irritated Germans worried about more immediate issues such as rising real estate prices, prospects for pensions and a diesel emissions scandal, and frustrated authorities in Brussels used to Berlin playing a lead role in major euro zone issues. 
It also added to doubts over whether the ruling parties, weakened after all losing ground in last autumn's election, can hold together for a full four-year term.
The clumsy compromise over Maassen, who has not commented in public about the allegations against him, unraveled on Friday when SPD leader Andrea Nahles said it was a mistake. 
A poll last week showed that 72 percent of voters had less confidence in the government as a result.
Support for all three parties has fallen since the election and there is little appetite among them for another ballot that polls suggest would strengthen the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
The coalition came close to collapsing in June over a dispute over immigration and border controls.
The CSU has toughened its line on the issue before a regional election in Bavaria next month in which it faces a tough challenge from the anti-immigration AfD.

EU Budget Commissioner Guenther Oettinger, a member of Merkel's CDU, complained in an interview on Sunday that a year in Europe had been wasted since Germany's last federal election. He said other EU countries expected the government of its largest economy to finally start tackling European issues.

Zakariah Okoth Obado, the governor of Migori county in western Kenya, denied killing Sharon Otieno and her unborn child in a short hearing broadcast live on state TV.
A witness said Otieno was abducted by four men in a car on the county's Homa Bay Road - which lies near Lake Victoria - on Sept. 3, prosecutors said in a statement.
Her body was found a day later in a thicket near Oyugis, a small town about 40 km (25 miles) away, the National Prosecution Authority added in the statement released on Twitter.
""It was established that an intimate relationship existed between Zakariah Okoth Obado, the Governor of the County of Migori, which subsequently led to a pregnancy with the deceased that the Governor was unhappy about,"" chief prosecutor Noordin Haji said in a statement.
""Sharon and her unborn baby lost their lives in a gruesome and horrifying manner in the hands of her killers,"" he added.
Local media said Obado was 59 while Otieno was in her 20s.
Obado denied a charge of murder. ""It's not true,"" he told the court after the charge was read out. 
Michael Juma Oyamo, described as Obado's personal assistant, was also charged with murder, while another assistant, Caspal Ojwang Obiero, was charged with aiding and abetting murder, the prosecutors said.
Neither of the assistants appeared in court to plead to the charges on Monday. Reuters was not able to speak to any of the defendants or their lawyers.
The chief prosecutor did not spell out what role the prosecution believed each person played, but said ""the hitmen and other persons"" had not yet been arrested.
Obado was remanded in custody by the High Court judge until Tuesday when his application for bail will be heard.

Tahrir al-Sham's stance will be critical to last week's deal which has, for now, averted a full-scale Syrian government offensive in Idlib, which along with adjacent areas of the northwest is the rebels' last major foothold.
The agreement requires ""radical"" insurgents including Tahrir al-Sham to withdraw from a demilitarized zone along the frontlines by October 15. 
""An official statement will be issued soon,"" after the group held internal consultation on the deal, said Emad al-Din, media officer for Tahrir al-Sham. He clarified that ""soon"" meant within a few days. 
Tahrir al-Sham was formed in early 2017 as an alliance of jihadist factions including the former al Qaeda affiliate the Nusra Front and it has a large armed presence throughout Idlib, including along the Turkish border. 
A smaller, harder line jihadist faction in Idlib, Huras al-Din, has rejected the agreement and urged rebels to launch new military operations.
An alliance of Turkey-allied rebel groups, the National Front for Liberation, has declared its ""complete cooperation"" with the Turkish effort, but has also ruled out disarming or yielding territory.
The demilitarized zone agreed by Turkey and Russia will be 15 to 20 km (10 to 12 miles) deep and run along the contact line between rebel and government fighters. It will be patrolled by Turkish and Russian forces.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that all opposition heavy weapons, mortars, tanks and rocket systems are to be removed from the zone by Oct. 10.
Close to three million people live in Idlib, around half of them Syrians displaced by the war from other parts of Syria, and the United Nations has warned that an offensive would cause a humanitarian catastrophe.

Al Shabaab, whose aim is to topple Somalia's U.N.-backed government and impose its own strict interpretation of Islam, intensified attacks in Kenya since Nairobi sent troops into Somalia in 2011. It wants the soldiers, who are part of an African Union peace-keeping mission, to leave Somalia.
But the frequency and severity of their attacks in Kenya has reduced in the past six months.
Kenyan security officials say the militants have used the Boni forest straddling the Kenya-Somalia border as a hideout.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union envoys are set to agree a new mechanism to punish chemical weapons' attacks by targeting people blamed for using banned munitions regardless of their nationality, diplomats said.
The legal regime, based on a French proposal to combat what Paris and London say is the repeated use of chemical weapons by Russia and Syria, would allow the EU to impose sanctions more quickly on specific individuals anywhere in the world, freezing their assets in the bloc and banning them from entry.
Ambassadors from the EU's 28 governments are expected to approve the regime at their weekly meeting on Wednesday, without debate. 
The EU already has sanctions lists for Syria and Russia, but under the current system individuals must be added to special country lists. These are complex to negotiate and difficult to expand because some EU governments are reluctant to criticize close partners, particularly Moscow.
""This is significant because we will be able to add names without a big, sensitive debate,"" said one senior EU diplomat involved in the negotiations. ""We can try to uphold certain rights rather than just issuing statements.""
Banned two decades ago under an international treaty, the rising use of nerve agents has alarmed Western governments.
Recent cases include the assassination of the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in 2017 and the attempted murder of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in March.
EU diplomats say the new chemical weapons regime could be followed up by a similar mechanism for human rights violations, similar to the United States' Global Magnitsky Act, which allows Washington to sanction individuals for abuses or corruption.
The regime, due to be given a final stamp of approval by EU foreign ministers on Oct. 15, will still need the support of all EU governments for names to be added, according to a preparatory paper seen by Reuters.
It was not immediately clear if Britain would propose to add two Russians accused of poisoning Skripal and his daughter.
But diplomats say it is a possibility as Britain has been unable to convince other EU countries to back new sanctions on Russia over the case.
Britain has charged two Russian men, identified as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, with attempting to murder Skripal and his daughter Yulia by spraying a chemical weapon on Skripal's front door in the English city of Salisbury.
France pushed the EU sanctions regime in part because the United Nations Security Council has been deadlocked over how to set up an independent inquiry for chemical attacks in Syria.

Russia rejected a joint draft resolution by Britain, France and the United States earlier this year.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has vowed to stand firm on a multi-billion dollar deal to buy warplanes from France's Dassault Aviation, as the opposition Congress party called on Monday for an inquiry into allegations of wrongdoing. 
Former French President Francois Hollande, who approved the deal when he was in office, triggered a political storm in India after he said the Indian government influenced the choice of a local partner in the deal.
New Delhi has denied the allegations, but opposition parties are gunning for Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the 2016 purchase of 36 Rafale planes estimated to be worth $8.7 billion, saying he overpaid for the planes and had not been transparent.
Congress' national spokesman Sanjay Jha said they would call for a joint parliamentary committee to investigate the deal, and organize public protests.
""We will take it to the people's court through protests and demonstrations as what is involved in this massive fraud is the taxpayers money,"" he told Reuters.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Sunday that the deal would proceed as planned.
""These jets will come to India. They will enhance the combat ability of the Indian Air Force,"" Jaitley told television news agency ANI, a Reuters affiliate.
In recent months, the opposition has questioned the government on the choice of billionaire Indian businessman Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence as Dassault's local partner instead of a state-run manufacturer with decades of experience.
On Friday, Hollande told French news service Mediapart that New Delhi had put pressure on Dassault to choose Reliance.
""We had no choice. We took the interlocutor that was given to us,"" Hollande was quoted as saying. 
Dassault has said it had picked Reliance as a partner for industrial reasons. Reliance has so far not commented on the matter.
Under Indian defense procurement rules, a foreign firm must invest at least 30 percent of the contract in India to help it build up its manufacturing base and wean off imports.
The French foreign ministry has said French authorities were not involved in the choice of Indian industrial partners involved in the Rafale deal. 
India's air force says it needs new combat jets to face a perceived twin threat from China and Pakistan.

The Rafale planes were picked from a field that included Lockheed Martin's F-16, Saab's Gripen, the Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the Russian MiG-35.

May next year is the most recent deadline Prayuth's junta has set for a vote its critics hope will return Thailand to civilian rule after more than four years of military rule, although it has repeatedly pushed back the timeline.
Critics say the military aims to maintain its grip on power beyond the election and they point to a military-backed constitution that limits the authority of civilian politicians.
""I can say right now that I am interested in politics,"" Prayuth, who has previously sidestepped questions about his political future, told reporters on Monday. 
""Because I love my country, like all Thai people,"" he said. He did not elaborate on his comments.
As army chief, Prayuth, 64, led a 2014 coup that ousted a civilian government to end a prolonged period of sometimes deadly unrest.
Technically Prayuth cannot stand for election under the constitution, because he would have had to resign from his post since 2017 to do so. Prayuth said on Monday he did not intend to quit as junta chief.
However, Prayuth could return as prime minister if a political party nominated him as its frontrunner.
The constitution offers Prayuth another route.
He could be chosen as an ""outside prime minister"" if 500 members, or two-thirds of the House of Representatives and the Upper House Senate, voted to kickstart the process, if the winning party's candidate failed to get enough votes. 
Watana Muangsook, a member of the opposition Puea Thai Party, welcomed Prayuth's participation in the next election but said he must first give up his post as junta chief.
""You may join whichever party, but you should resign as junta chief to lay down your weapons and play fair like everybody else,"" Watana told Reuters.

The junta, formally known as the National Council for Peace and Order, has promised to relax its curbs on political activities before the vote, to allow political parties to complete administrative tasks between September and December.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was detained on Monday over allegations of staging illegal protests, his associates aid, adding that the move was meant to sideline him at a time of growing discontent over unpopular government reforms. 
Navalny's arrest came moments after he walked free from jail at the end of an previous incarceration, his supporters said.
The Russian Interior Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
The Kremlin's plan to raise the retirement age has seen thousands of Russians take to the streets in recent weeks and shaved around 15 percentage points off President Vladimir Putin's popularity rating. 
Navalny's new detention came after he finished a 30-day stint in jail for planning an unauthorized demonstration in the Russian capital in January that called for a boycott of what he said would be a rigged presidential election. 
He said at the time that his jail sentence was designed by the authorities to prevent him from leading nationwide protests against the pension reform on Sept. 9, where more than 800 people were detained.
Leonid Volkov, a Navalny ally, wrote on Twitter on Monday morning that Navalny had been taken to a police station as he walked out of jail and was again being accused of violating protest laws.
Navalny's case will be heard in court later on Monday and he could face a fine and up to 20 days in jail, his spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh wrote on Twitter.
Lyubov Sobol, a lawyer at Navalny's anti-corruption foundation, said he was being targeted by the authorities because of the pension reform protests. 
""They are isolating a politician and leader of the opposition,"" she wrote on Twitter. 
The proposed pension reforms are the most unpopular government measure since a 2005 move to scrap Soviet-era benefits, though Putin softened the plan after initial protests. 

Navalny, who has been repeatedly jailed for planning unauthorized demonstrations, has pledged he would never give up trying to organize street protests.

Eighteen of those ordered detained were on active duty, Anadolu news agency said, adding the suspects included 13 majors and 12 captains from the land forces and 24 first lieutenants from the navy.
Authorities have carried out regular sweeps against alleged members of cleric Fethullah Gulen's network since the coup attempt of July 2016, in which 250 people were killed. Gulen denies involvement.
In a separate operation, Istanbul police said they detained 21 people who were using an encrypted messaging application used by the network. Most of those detained were teachers who formerly taught at the network's schools or public institutions, police said.
Turkey's Western allies have criticized the post-coup crackdown, which mostly took place under a state of emergency which was declared shortly after the attempted coup and remained in effect until July 2018.

President Tayyip Erdogan's critics accuse him of using the failed putsch as a pretext to quash dissent. Turkey says the measures are necessary to combat threats to national security.

RIGA, Latvia (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Monday urged Latvians, who broke with the Soviet Union nearly 30 years ago, to cherish their hard-won freedom and to not forget the sacrifices of those who died for it. 
Francis is visiting Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, three countries who are looking warily towards what they fear is a newly hostile Russia.
""You know all too well the price of that freedom, which you have had to win over and over again,"" Francis said in a speech to President Raimonds Vejonis and the diplomatic corps shortly after his arrival in the Latvian capital.
All three countries initially won independence from imperial Russia 100 years ago, were annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, occupied by the Nazis during World War Two and were then satellite republics of the Soviet Union until 1991.
Francis said their tragic history should remind Latvians of the importance of treasuring freedom and independence.
""If today we can celebrate, it is due to all those who blazed trails and opened a door to the future, bequeathed to you that same responsibility,"" he said aid before laying flowers at the Monument to Freedom in Riga.
The Nazis, who occupied Latvia during World War Two, killed some 70,000 of the country's Jews and later the Soviets deported some 60,000 people to Siberia.
Recent events in Russia, with which all three states share a land border, have brought on new nervousness. All three are members of the European Union and NATO.
""The fates of the Baltic States in the 20th century is a living testimony to the fact that a divided Europe leads only to suffering,"" Vejonis told the pope.
As Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and fears grew that the Baltics might be next on Moscow's list, defense spending was increased sharply and several thousand NATO soldiers were deployed.

666,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 04:15AM ET</span>",Gloom in the newsroom as Hungary's independent media recedes,"By Marton Dunai
BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The new owners of the largest independent news outlet in Hungary say they will not meddle in its editorial policies. Reporters at Index.hu are far from sure, and recent history shows why.
Dozens of newspapers, radio and television stations critical of Prime Minister Viktor Orban have changed hands in the past four years. Some subsequently closed down, while others quickly and dramatically changed their tune.
On the day news channel Hir TV was taken over last month, one of its new owners, Zsolt Nyerges, told the newsroom he would not interfere with its work.
That evening's programs, including a hard-hitting political talk show, were canceled. In its place, a recent Orban speech played on a loop.
Last week, the European Union's parliament voted to punish Hungary for flouting EU rules on democracy, corruption and civil rights, including media freedom, although the actual punishment, suspending its voting rights, is unlikely.
An EU parliamentary report said media had been concentrated in the hands of pro-Orban oligarchs, state-funded advertising went largely to outlets loyal to the government and other journalists were often banned from parliament.
Hungary's government has denied undermining press freedom and says it has no desire to control the media. It is taking the EU Parliament to court, accusing it of breaching voting rules.
Asked about Index's independence, one of its new ultimate owners, Gabor Ziegler, said on Wednesday it was guaranteed.
""We have no right to interfere with daily editing or the paper's contents,"" he said in an interview with napi.hu, one of a number of smaller sites clustered around Index that Ziegler and his partner also acquired. 
""We need an independent, widely read and decidedly high-quality Index.hu to achieve our business goals.""
Index.hu's editorial line has not changed since the takeover on Monday, but staff are on the alert. A new dial on its home page has a needle pointing towards ""independent"": next to it is ""in danger"" and further along, ""not independent"".
""When it changes we'll talk. As loudly as possible"", the strapline says. A statement signed by dozens of staff likened the situation to a war.
Chief editor Attila Toth-Szenesi told Reuters his fellow journalists were tense. ""We would like to work peacefully,"" he said. ""It is not good for anyone for us to be the news.""
""DOOMSDAY SCENARIO""
Ziegler and media investor Jozsef Oltyan gained ultimate control over Index by buying media group cemp-X Online Zrt, which sells its advertising space, as well as the company owning the foundation set up to guarantee Index's editorial freedom.
Oltyan is a member of a party in coalition with Orban's ruling Fidesz, while Ziegler has been a staff member on Index's business side for nearly two decades.
Editor Toth-Szenesi said he was concerned that the ownership change could bring Index.hu under the influence of Fidesz and its ideological agenda called the ""National System of Cooperation"" (NER).
NER was launched in 2010 to counter liberal values and champion nationalist policies, and under its auspices some of Orban's friends and family have won an increasing share of publicly funded business.
""What seems to be the doomsday scenario may be reality,"" Toth-Szenesi said. ""It may in fact be the NER approaching Index right now."" 
Ziegler denied that.
""I would like to reject that in the strongest possible terms,"" he wrote in an emailed response to Reuters. ""We decided freely to buy (the companies that own Index and sister publications); there is nobody behind us.""
He added that nobody had the option to buy the companies in the future, and they wanted to hold on to them for the long term.
Oltyan did not respond to requests for comment.
Since Orban was reelected for a third straight term in a landslide election in April, the pace of news outlets changing hands has accelerated. 
Political loyalty has paid off for dozens of titles that have toed the government line. Those that back Orban get more state advertising spending, media researchers say.
About 10 percent of state online ad spending goes to Index, for example, while its closest rival, pro-government Origo, gets about 80 percent, a proportion that shot up after its takeover by a pro-government group in 2015, media analysis group Mertek said.
Asked about state ad revenue, Ziegler told Napi.hu: ""If the change of ownership means we have an easier time, we will take advantage of opportunities more easily.""
Revenue from state ads at TV2, Hungary's second largest commercial channel, more than tripled in 2016 after Orban ally Andy Vajna took it over, research company Kantar media said, while state income stayed flat at levels far below TV2's at market leader RTL.
""Many commercial advertisers publish ads in pro-government media that is watched or read by hardly anyone,"" media analyst Attila Batorfy said. ""We can call that lobbying money.""
""Things like reach or visitor numbers make no difference, replaced by an adjustment to government. This is harmful on every level.""
As the media landscape narrows, more Hungarians have turned to Index. Average daily visitor numbers so far this month are up 20 percent from the same period in 2017, to 630,000, according to figures from web-monitoring service DKT.
Orban is scathing about the website, which carries investigations into alleged government corruption and editorials criticizing his anti-immigration, anti-European Union rhetoric alongside straightforward news.
At a public event in May, Orban met a question from one of its reporters with: ""I won't answer to fake news factories"".
DEJA VU
Hir TV continues to follow the government's cue.
""The EU wants to strip Hungary of the right to defend our borders,"" said the main story on its website after the European Parliament's censure vote.
For Gabor Varga, an investigative journalist at the station who quit on the spot last month, it was déjà vu. He had previously worked at Nepszabadsag, the country's top daily, until another Orban ally bought the newspaper then shut it in 2016.
Varga is looking for another job in journalism but with more than a dozen newsrooms recently disbanded, his options are limited.
""Lots of my fellow journalists have become political activists of sorts, and I will not follow them,"" he said. ""I believe in objective, balanced journalism. That doesn't work in Hungary.""
Four prominent media outlets were caught up in a public feud between Orban and his former ally Lajos Simicska, a media mogul whose portfolio included Hir TV and the conservative magazine Heti Valasz, which had given an outlet to conservative voices sometimes at odds with Orban's anti-immigration views.
After Simicska broke with Orban in a public spat in 2015, private advertisers followed a state ad moratorium and withdrew from Heti Valasz. A one-billion forint ($3.6 million) profit in 2014 became a 900-million forint loss in 2017.
In July, Simicska sold the ailing magazine to Nyerges at the same time as Hir TV. Despite interest from investors in buying Heti Valasz, Nyerges shut it down within weeks.
Last October, David Kostelancik, then the top U.S. diplomat in Hungary, said the country's independent journalists ""face pressure and intimidation"" from the government, noting that the government directed substantial advertising contracts to friendly media outlets.
The Hungarian Foreign Ministry summoned Kostelancik to the ministry and said the comments were ""uninvited interference in Hungarian internal politics.""
The next month, Washington announced a program ""to increase citizens' access to objective information"" by awarding a grant of up to $700,000 to a provincial news organization.
Ferenc Nimmerfroh, fired from editing a local daily in Pecs, southern Hungary, soon after premier Orban's close friend bought it in early 2017, was hopeful his application to launch a website with a string of regional newsrooms would win.
As Hungary's relations with the United States warmed after the election of President Donald Trump, Nimmerfroh said he began to fear the program was doomed. In July the U.S. State Department dropped it before the grant was awarded.

The State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Budapest did not reply to emailed questions about the reversal. Ambassador David Cornstein told the New York Times in August that the U.S. had reconsidered its overall view of the subject.

""We keep on negotiating in good faith, we try and get the best deal we can, but we are ready for all eventualities,"" Raab told TalkRadio. ""We'll keep negotiating in good faith, I'm confident we'll get there."" 
Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday that Brexit talks with the EU had hit an impasse, defiantly challenging the bloc to come up with its own plans after EU leaders savaged her proposals.
However, Raab said it was important not to overreact to the ""stubborn"" tone struck by Brussels and that some setbacks were to be expected. 
""These blips in the world, they're blown a little bit out of proportion, but we double down, we don't throw our toys out the pram, hold our nerve, keep our cool,"" Raab said.
""But at the same we need to be ready for the possibility ... that the ambitions that we are bringing to these negotiations to try and get a win-win deal isn't matched by the other side and it does take two to tango.""

Britain's opposition Labour Party will vote this week on whether there should be a second referendum on the outcome of the Brexit talks, although its finance spokesman said on Monday these would be on any final deal struck rather than on reversing the process altogether.
Raab said such a stance made it more likely they would fail to get any deal.
""What they (the EU) need to see is some unity of purpose from the UK which is why all this Labour nonsense about a second referendum is not only undemocratic but it's the last thing we should be doing right now with our EU partners because it encourages them to offer us a lousy deal which makes a no deal more likely,"" he said.

The sailor, Abhilash Tomy, called for emergency aid on Saturday after the yacht was badly damaged in a storm about 3,500 km (2,175 miles) west of the Australian coast, leaving him with severe back injuries.
The Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which is coordinating the rescue, said it expected a French fisheries patrol vessel to reach Tomy's precariously-placed yacht as soon as 0700 GMT.
""All indications are the vessel is upright and floating high in the water but at any moment, a wave could push one of the damaged masts into the vessel and compromise its integrity,"" Phil Gaden, a search and rescue official, told reporters in Canberra, the Australian capital.
The mast hangs over the yacht precariously, stoking fears that it could become dislodged and damage the watertight body of the boat, Gaden added.
Despite the nearness of the French ship, Gaden cautioned that rescuers might not be able to evacuate Tomy because of the yacht damage, in which case an Australian naval boat, positioned further away, might have to undertake the rescue.
Tomy, whose website says he became the first Indian to circumnavigate the globe in 2013, was contesting in the 30,000-mile (48000-km) Golden Globe Race. 

Participant crafts, similar to those used 50 years ago in the first such race, which features a solo circumnavigation of the globe, are barred from using modern technology, except for their communications gear.

LIVERPOOL, England (Reuters) - Britain's opposition Labour Party will vote this week to keep a second Brexit referendum on the table if Theresa May fails to pass her plan to quit the European Union through parliament, heaping pressure on a struggling prime minister.
After May's plans for Brexit - the biggest shift in British policy for more than four decades - were rebuffed by the EU on Thursday, the outcome of talks to leave are more uncertain than ever and have boosted those who want to stop the divorce.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been reluctant to support behind growing demands for a second referendum, or People's Vote, but the motion agreed by members after more than five hours of debate may satisfy both sides of the party's divide.
Labour agreed late on Sunday night the party will vote on Tuesday on a motion committing the party to support ""all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote"" if no election is triggered by May's Brexit plans.
Earlier, Corbyn had spurred hopes among those campaigning for a second referendum when he said he would back such a vote if his party voted to pursue the move. 
But for his backers, the motion does little to change his position that Labour prefers a general election to a second vote, which will ask a different question from the one posed at the 2016 referendum which showed a narrow margin for leave.
Corbyn's second in command, finance spokesman John McDonnell repeated that Labour was getting ready for an election.
""We believe general election is the best solution because people can then have a wide-ranging debate and also then choose the team that would then do the negotiations,"" McDonnell told Sky News. 
He said a second referendum would be on the deal itself rather than a repeat of the question posed in 2016, whether to remain in the EU or to leave.
ALL OPTIONS OPEN
Britain is to exit the EU in March next year after months of talks that have again exposed the deep divides in both the country's main parties - the Conservatives are all but at war with each other and Labour is also at odds over how to leave. 
The country's path out of the bloc is even more unclear after weeks of positive noises about the prospects of clinching a divorce deal and one on a future trading relationship, the mood between Britain and the EU turned sour on Thursday.
That has increased the possibility of Britain leaving without a deal, which could hurt the economy and sever trade flows, and spurred those who want another referendum to try to overturn the 2016 vote.
On Sunday, the campaign for a People's Vote said its supporters were pleased with ""signs that the Labour leadership was listening to its membership"".
But May has ruled out a second referendum and has said she will hold her nerve in talks with the EU over her Chequers plan, named after her country residence where an agreement with her top ministers was hashed out in July.
Many in both parties question out loud whether there is time to stage another referendum.
May's Conservative Party criticized Corbyn for his move.

""Jeremy Corbyn this morning proved he is not fit to govern our country. He confirmed Labour would take us back to square one on Brexit,"" Brandon Lewis, the party's chairman, said on Sunday.

671,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 02:42AM ET</span>",Hong Kong pro-independence party formally outlawed in first such move since handover,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong authorities formally banned on Monday a group promoting independence from China - the first outlawing of a political organization since Britain handed its former colony back to Chinese rule in 1997.
The city's Secretary for Security John Lee announced the ban on the Hong Kong National Party in a brief statement published in the government's gazette, 10 days after the party submitted arguments against the move.
Lee ordered the ban under Hong Kong's Societies Ordinance, a previously little noticed colonial-era law that requires all social groups and organizations to register with the police.
The law allows the government to ban groups ""in the interests of national security, public order or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others"".
Lee later told reporters that the two-year-old group was prepared to use ""all methods"" to forge independence, which posed a threat to national security and broke the Basic Law, the mini-constitution that governs Hong Kong's relations with China.
""It has a clear agenda in making Hong Kong a republic,"" Lee said.
Lee also said the group had spread ""hatred and discrimination against mainland Chinese"". 
The authorities could not rule out action against other groups, including those promoting ""self determination"" as well as full independence, he said.
Hong Kong's nascent independence movement shows little sign of generating widespread public support but the government's move in July to announce it was considering a ban on the Hong Kong National Party propelled its leader, Andy Chan, to prominence.
Hong Kong is governed under a ""one country, two systems"" principle which allows the global financial hub a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed in China, including an independent legal system and freedoms of speech and assembly. 
The 28-year-old Chan has been widely quoted in local and international media in recent weeks. In August, he spoke at Hong Kong's Foreign Correspondent's Club, a move condemned by the Chinese Foreign Ministry and locally-based Chinese officials.
""I will never stop in my pursuit of freedom, human rights, equality and dignity,"" Chan told Reuters earlier. 
He could not be reached for comment on Monday, while some media reports said he was considering a legal appeal.
Local government efforts to find ways of cracking down on the independence movement follows a warning last year from President Xi Xinping during a visit to the city that any attempt to endanger China's sovereignty crossed a ""red line"".
China's central government backed Monday's ban, with a spokesperson for the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office expressing ""resolute support"", the Xinhua news agency reported.
The central government supported the Hong Kong authorities in punishing any acts that jeopardized national security and had zero tolerance for any organizations preaching Hong Kong independence or engaging in activities of splitting the country, Xinhua quoted the spokesperson as saying.

China's perceived tightening grip over the city has stoked tensions in recent years, including the ""Occupy Central"" movement in 2014 that blocked major roads for nearly three months in a failed bid to pressure Beijing to allow full democracy.

A scare has gripped neighboring Australia, where police are investigating more than 100 reports of needles found in fruit during recent weeks.
Needles, first found in strawberries produced by one supplier in the northern state of Queensland, are now turning up around the country in the berries and other fruits.
New Zealand grocery chain Countdown, which is owned by Australia's Woolworths Limited said in a statement on its website on Sunday that 'Choice' strawberries, which are sourced from the state of Western Australia, would be withdrawn ""as a precautionary measure"" after needles were found.
It was unclear when the contaminated berries entered New Zealand but last week Australia had said it was using metal detectors to screen all strawberry exports.
New Zealand's Primary Industries Minister Damien O'Connor on Monday said it was unclear whether the strawberries had been tampered with in Australia or New Zealand.
""I'm hoping no New Zealander would be such an idiot,"" he said, according to the New Zealand Herald newspaper, adding that food safety regulators were conducting a ""thorough inquiry"".
Countdown said it was in contact with both New Zealand and Australian authorities, who were investigating the issue.

Earlier this year, Turkey carried out a military operation to seize control of Syria's Afrin region from the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which Ankara considers a terrorist organization. The YPG also controls the Syrian region east of the Euphrates.
""God willing, in the period ahead we will increase the number of secure zones in Syria, encompassing the east of the Euphrates,"" Erdogan said in a speech during a visit to New York.
Before the Afrin operation, Turkey also carried out a cross-border operation dubbed ""Euphrates Shield"", which targeted both the YPG and Islamic State fighters east of Afrin.
After the completion of Euphrates Shield in early 2017, Turkey set up local systems of governance in the swathe of land under its control and protected by Turkish forces. It has done the same in Afrin.
Erdogan has in the past warned of new military operations against the YPG along the Syrian border and if necessary into northern Iraq. 
Expanding Turkey's military campaign into the much larger Kurdish-held territory east of the Euphrates would risk confronting troops of NATO ally the United States, that are deployed alongside a YPG-dominated force there.
The YPG has been Washington's main ally against Islamic State in Syria, infuriating Ankara which sees the Kurdish force as an extension of a militant group waging a decades-long insurgency in southeast Turkey.

Erdogan's comments come a week after he and Russia's Vladimir Putin announced a deal under which Russian and Turkish troops will enforce a demilitarized zone in northwest Syria's Idlib region.

Since the group that includes 12 former heads of state began advocating for an end to drug prohibition in 2011, a growing number of countries and U.S. states have created medical or recreational markets for marijuana.
Now the group is looking at ways to smooth the way out of prohibition, recommending countries start regulating lower-potency drugs as well as reforms to international treaties that require prohibition and punishment.
""The international drug control system is clearly failing,"" said Helen Clark, a former prime minister of New Zealand. ""The health … of nations is not advanced by the current approach to drug control.""
By taking control of illegal drug markets, the report argues governments can weaken the powerful criminal gangs that have grown despite decades of efforts to stamp them out.
The report, ""Regulation: The Responsible Control of Drugs"" by the Global Commission on Drug Policy, will be released at an event on Monday in Mexico City.
The commission chose to launch its report in Mexico, whose criminal gangs are top suppliers of heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana to the United States and where gang-related violence has driven murders to a record high.
""Mexico is the most important country in the fight against drugs,"" said former Colombian president Cesar Gaviria.
Mexico's recent history exemplifies the report's claim that evidence shows arresting drug traffickers has little impact on drug supply and may increase violence. 
Just over 10 years ago, Mexico intensified its battle with drug gangs by sending out the military to battle traffickers.
While dozens of kingpins have been captured or killed, the number of gangs operating in Mexico has multiplied as new criminal leaders step into the breach and battle over turf. 
The commission recommends governments open participatory processes to shape reforms toward regulation. 
Incoming Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has already started to hold town-hall reviews on violence and discuss potential ""amnesty"" for non-violent drug traffickers and farmers. Members of his team have said Mexico will evaluate creating legal markets for marijuana as well as opium.
The report calls for a renegotiation of the international treaties that created a ""repressive"" strategy where drug users and low-level dealers face stiff prison sentences, but it cautions nations are far from a global consensus yet.
Canada will legalize recreational marijuana use on Oct. 17, and it recognizes it is violating treaties. 

""Current drug policies are reducing neither the demand nor the supply of illegal drugs, quite the contrary, while the increasing power of organized crime is a sad reality,"" writes Ruth Driefuss, the former president of Switzerland and chair of the commission.

678,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2018 12:57AM ET</span>",Testimony by Kavanaugh accuser set; new allegation surfaces,"By Doina Chiacu and Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The university professor who accused Brett Kavanaugh, U.S. President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, of sexual assault will testify before a Senate panel on Thursday about her allegation, her lawyers and the committee said on Sunday.
The agreement for Christine Blasey Ford to testify came just hours before the New Yorker magazine published an article in which a second woman, identified as Deborah Ramirez, described another instance of alleged sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh, also in the 1980s, when both attended Yale University.
Ford's agreement to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee came a week after she went public in an interview in the Washington Post with her allegation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in 1982 when both were high school students in Maryland.
Her allegation against the conservative federal appeals court judge has endangered his confirmation by the Republican-led Senate to a lifetime job on the top U.S. court.
Kavanaugh has also agreed to testify at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing planned for 10 a.m. on Thursday.
The potentially explosive hearing, set against a backdrop of the #MeToo movement fighting sexual harassment and assault, comes just weeks before Nov. 6 congressional elections in which Democrats are trying to take control of Congress from Trump's fellow Republicans.
The New Yorker magazine reported that Senate Democrats are investigating the new allegation against Kavanaugh that dates to the 1983-84 academic year, when Kavanaugh was a Yale freshman. Ramirez is cited by the New Yorker as saying Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken dormitory party.
Kavanaugh has called Ford's allegation ""completely false"" and said in a statement provided by the White House on Sunday night the incident described by Ramirez ""did not happen.""
""This is a smear, plain and simple,"" Kavanaugh said.
""I look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth, and defending my good name - and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building - against these last-minute allegations,"" Kavanaugh said in the statement.
White House spokeswoman Kerri Kupec called the new allegation part of a ""coordinated smear campaign by the Democrats designed to tear down a good man.""
""The White House stands firmly behind Judge Kavanaugh,"" Kupec said.
The magazine said it has not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party at issue in Ramirez's account.
After the New Yorker article was published, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, wrote to the panel's Republican chairman, Senator Chuck Grassley, asking for an ""immediate postponement of any further proceedings"" on Kavanaugh's nomination.
""I also ask that the newest allegations of sexual misconduct be referred to the FBI for investigation,"" Feinstein wrote.
Grassley's spokesman, Taylor Foy, accused Senate Democrats of withholding information on the latest allegation and of seeking a ""political takedown"" of Kavanaugh. He did not offer any evidence, except to cite the New Yorker report that the committee's Democratic staff were made aware of the allegations.
""Of course, we will attempt to evaluate these new claims,"" Foy said in a statement, adding that the committee's Republican staff only learned of Ramirez's allegation from the New Yorker article on Sunday evening. The New Yorker story, however, said senior Republican staffers were informed last week.
UNRESOLVED ISSUES
Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University in California, has said Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in 1982 when both were high school students in Maryland. She accused him of attacking her and trying to remove her clothing while he was drunk at a party when he was 17 years old and she was 15.
There are still unresolved procedural and logistical issues regarding Ford's testimony, her lawyers said, including whether the Judiciary Committee's Republican senators, who are all male, or staff attorneys would question her. Ford's lawyers said ""various senators have been dismissive of her account and should have to shoulder their responsibility to ask her questions.""
Ford's lawyers said that, in a Sunday morning call with committee staff members, they agreed to the hearing even though the committee refused to subpoena Mark Judge, a Kavanaugh friend who Ford said witnessed the attack, as well as others she said were present.
""Despite actual threats to her safety and her life, Dr. Ford believes it is important for senators to hear directly from her about the sexual assault committed against her,"" Ford's attorneys Debra Katz, Lisa Banks and Michael Bromwich said in a statement.
""She has agreed to move forward with a hearing even though the Committee has refused to subpoena Mark Judge,"" it said. ""They have also refused to invite other witnesses who are essential for a fair hearing that arrives at the truth about the sexual assault.""
Grassley had set several deadlines since Friday for Ford to decide whether and how she would testify before the panel.
""Following Dr. Ford's testimony, Judge Kavanaugh will appear again before the committee,"" according to a statement from the committee.
Kavanaugh was questioned by committee staff last week.
Grassley's counsel said in a note to Ford's lawyers that ""the Chairman asked me to relay again that he will do everything in his power to provide a safe, comfortable and dignified forum for Dr. Ford to testify."" The counsel said it was the committee's ""non-negotiable"" right to determine who would be allowed to testify.

Kavanaugh's confirmation would solidify conservative control of the Supreme Court and advance Trump's goal of moving the high court and the broader federal judiciary to the right.

Cody Wilson, 30, flew to Taiwan after learning he was under investigation, police said, and was picked up by Taiwanese authorities on Friday after his U.S. passport was annulled. He was deported to the United States on Saturday.
He was booked into Harris County jail in Houston on Sunday, according to the jail's website.
Wilson's attorney, Samy Khalil, said in a statement late on Sunday: ""We are glad that Cody is back in Texas again where we can work with him on his case. That's our focus right now, representing our client and preparing his defense.""
As the founder of Defense Distributed, Wilson became a notable figure in the U.S. debate over guns after the company posted on the internet the blueprints for plastic guns that can be made with a 3-D printer.
The files could previously be downloaded for free but a federal judge issued a nationwide injunction last month that blocked the posting of the blueprints online.
Wilson was placed under investigation after a counsellor told authorities on Aug. 22 a 16-year-old girl said she was paid $500 to have sex with Wilson at an Austin hotel, police said.

Investigators later interviewed the girl and obtained a warrant for Wilson's arrest on Wednesday, but by then he had caught a flight to Taiwan. Police said at the time they were aware Wilson traveled often for business but that it was not clear why he had flown to Taiwan.

The Newspoll published in The Australian newspaper showed the Liberal-National coalition government trails the main opposition Labor party by a margin of 54 percent to 46 percent on a two-party preferred basis under Australia's preferential voting system, where votes from minor parties are redistributed.
Despite the prospect of a landslide election defeat, Australia's pre-eminent political poll showed at least some voters had forgiven the Liberal party, the senior coalition partner, for the ousting of former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull in a party-room vote in August.
Newly installed Prime Minister Scott Morrison became Australia's sixth leader in less than 10 years after that vote.
His government trailed Labor by 12 percentage points earlier this month as voters, angry over the revolving door of political leadership, abandoned the coalition in the immediate aftermath of the latest change.
Morrison must return to the polls by May 2019, an election that is poised to be fought over inequality.
Labor has pledged to cut capital gains tax discounts and scrap a favorable tax scheme for owners of multiple properties, known as negative gearing, amid soaring house prices.
Morrison opposes both moves. Despite the modest uptick in support, his first major test will come in the Sydney seat recently vacated by Turnbull, whose decision to quit politics left Morrison presiding over a minority government.
Turnbull's affluent harbourside electorate is normally a safe seat for the government but a looming by-election triggered by his departure is now likely to be a tight race.

A loss would force Morrison to strike an agreement with independent lawmakers to continue in minority government.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - He has chaired board meetings, cabinet meetings and starred in a reality television show, but on Wednesday U.S. President Donald Trump will wield the gavel in the United Nations Security Council to denounce Iran for what his administration sees as its malign regional behavior.
Trump is able to preside over the 15-member council as the United States holds the monthly rotating presidency, which coincides with the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations in New York this week. 
""I am sure that's going to be the most watched Security Council meeting ever,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told reporters.
But despite the unpredictable nature of Trump, some diplomats aren't expecting a reality television performance in the Security Council, where nearly every member is likely to be represented by their prime minister or president except Russia and China, which are expected to send ministers.
""I don't think it will be that entertaining at all,"" said one senior U.N. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
""Even those who don't like him, the attitude of all other heads of state and government in a public meeting when faced with any president of the United States of America is to be on their best behavior,"" the diplomat said. 
It is rare for the council - formed in 1945 to maintain international peace and security - to meet at the head-of-state and government level. This will be the third time the body is chaired by a U.S. president. It has the ability to impose sanctions or authorize the use of military force. 
Trump's predecessor Barack Obama presided over meetings in 2009 and 2014 on nuclear nonproliferation and foreign terrorist fighters. In both cases the council adopted resolutions on the topics under discussion. U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said there are no plans to adopt a resolution at Wednesday's meeting.
""We want to make sure (Iran) understands the world is watching. That's the biggest reason for this meeting,"" she said earlier this month.
'THRILLED'
The topic of the meeting will be nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, a broad issue that allows leaders around the horse-shoe table to raise a variety of subjects from North Korea to chemical weapons attacks in Syria and Britain.
However, Trump signaled on Twitter he will zero in on Iran, when he posted: ""I will chair a United Nations Security Council meeting on Iran."" Tehran has accused the United States of abusing the power of the Security Council president. 
The U.S. concept note on the meeting circulated to Security Council members does not specifically mention any countries. 
""The purpose of this meeting is to discuss ways the Security Council can better enforce the resolutions it has adopted ... to counter the spread and use of the world's most dangerous weapons,"" it reads. 
The role of the Security Council president is typically administrative and neutral. The president is in charge of scheduling and presiding over council meetings and briefing other members states and the press on the council's work.
Trump will have a binder in front of him to read from in order to run Wednesday's meeting. He will make a statement first in his national capacity and then it is likely to take about two hours for all council members to speak. Haley has twice taken council envoys to Washington, where they have met with Trump. 
Russia has shielded Iran from U.S. attempts to get the Security Council to call out Tehran over accusations it supplied weapons to Yemen's Houthi group, a charge that Iran denies.
When asked what he thought about Trump chairing a Security Council meeting, Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said with a smile: ""I felt thrilled."" He added: ""I don't think we will see any major intrigue in what he will say.""

682,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2018 09:44PM ET</span>",Woods ends five-year drought with Tour Championship triumph,"(Reuters) - Tiger Woods was moved to the brink of tears after capturing his first title since 2013 with a two-stroke triumph at the Tour Championship in Atlanta on Sunday that proved he was far from washed up at the age of 42. 
Tossing aside five years of career-threatening injury woes, Woods reasserted his status as the best frontrunner in the history of the sport, leading throughout the final round and finishing at 11-under-par 269 at East Lake.
With the massive gallery chanting his name as they stampeded the final fairway in scenes reminiscent of British Opens of yesteryear, Woods moved within two victories of Sam Snead's all-time record of 82 PGA Tour titles.
""I was having a hard time not crying coming up the last hole,"" he said.
""All of a sudden it started hitting me I was going to win the tournament.
""I've been sitting on 79 (wins) for five years now. To get 80 is a pretty damn good feeling.""
After carding 71, Woods walked off to a big kiss from girlfriend Erica Herman and a hug from agent Mark Steinberg as security tried to keep the frenzied fans at bay.
The victory capped off a season that started with questions over whether Woods, now 10 years removed from his 14th major title, would even be able to play a full schedule after undergoing spinal fusion surgery in April 2017.
""My body was a wreck,"" recalled Woods, who hoped the operation would alleviate debilitating back and leg pain.
""The low point was not knowing whether I would be able to live pain-free again.
""I was beyond playing. I couldn't sit, I couldn't walk, I couldn't lay down without feeling the pain in my back and leg.""
That the procedure worked was evident on Sunday as Woods was never seriously challenged after starting the day with a three-shot cushion over Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose.
McIlroy, playing with Woods, quickly dropped out of contention with an error-strewn driving performance that ultimately ended with a 74, leaving world number one Rose as the only realistic threat.
The Englishman also struggled, however, and Woods did what he used to do so brilliantly in his prime, keeping his card clean, on the front nine at least, and forcing his pursuers to come and get him.
He drained a 10-foot birdie for a confidence-boosting start at the first, and then parred the next eight holes, using a deft short game and a hot putter to extricate himself from trouble on a couple of occasions.
Woods built a five-shot lead at the turn, and despite bogeys at the 10th, 15th and 16th holes held off his fast-finishing compatriot Billy Horschel, who carded a 66 for second place on nine-under.
PERFECT RECORD 
The win preserved Woods's perfect record of never having lost after leading by three shots or more going into the final round, a record he extended to 24-for-24.
Rose, meanwhile, received a $10 million consolation prize in the form of the FedExCup, which is awarded to the winner of the tour's season-long points race, after a birdie at the 18th gave him a 73 for a share of fourth.
Had Rose not picked up a shot at the last, Woods would have taken the FedExCup as well, although that was hardly an issue for the American, who now seems odds-on to surpass Snead's record for tour victories. 
With his 43rd birthday approaching in December, Woods remains a long shot to win five more majors to overhaul the career tally of Jack Nicklaus even if the Golden Bear himself was not ruling it out. 
""Maybe Tiger's got another 40 majors to play,"" 18-times major winner Nicklaus said. ""Out of 40 majors can he win five of them, I don't know?""
Woods will have little time to celebrate his victory before joining the U.S. team for the Ryder Cup against Europe starting on Friday.
He did have time, however, to remember his father and earliest mentor Earl, who died in 2006. 
""Pops would be very proud of the way I went out today,"" he said.
""I knew if I shot under par I would win. Just to be able to compete and play again this year, that's a hell of a comeback.

""It's been an unbelievable season from beginning to end. I appreciate it much more now than 20 years ago.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - At the United Nations this week, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has to contend with some daunting challenges - her debut before world leaders and the sleep schedule of her 3-month-old baby. 
The 38-year-old Ardern has made global headlines since coming to power last October when she became only the second elected leader to give birth while in office, after Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto in 1990. 
She is not only her country's youngest premier, but the first to take maternity leave while in office, and is widely seen as a symbol of progress for women. 
As she prepared for her first U.N. address on Thursday, she also had the daunting task of traveling halfway round the world with a baby. Nearly 130 leaders and dozens of ministers will be at U.N. headquarters this week. 
Ardern, who is breastfeeding and cannot be away from her baby for extended periods, will be accompanied by her partner, Clarke Gayford, who acts as daughter Neve Te Aroha's full-time caregiver. 
""I'm lucky. I have an incredible support network around me. I have the ability to take my child to work. There’s not many places you can do that,"" Ardern told a Social Good Summit in New York on Sunday. 
""Unless there is a culture that accepts that mothers and children are part of our workplaces, then we won't change anything. So if I can do one thing and that is just change the way we think about these things, then I will feel pleased that we have achieved something,"" she said. 

When the event moderator remarked that the baby was backstage and very peaceful, Ardern quipped: ""Wasn't at 3:30 this morning.""

MANAGUA (Reuters) - Police and supporters of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega clashed in Managua on Sunday with demonstrators calling for the release of people imprisoned during recent protests, leaving at least one person dead, authorities said. 
Hundreds of protesters carrying Nicaragua's blue and white flag massed in the eastern part of the capital in the morning after squads of police prevented the demonstrators from reaching the city center. 
""We are marching for the freedom of our children who are not criminals. They are fighting to have a better country,"" said Mercedes Davila, the mother of a student leader, Edwin Carcache, who she said had been jailed on charges of terrorism.
Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the crowd, and armed supporters of Ortega opened fire on demonstrators, local media said. At least one woman passing by was hit by a bullet, according to a Reuters witness. 
Nicaragua's National Police said in a statement that one person was killed in the ""crossfire"" between demonstrators, whom police characterized as ""terrorists,"" and families who were defending their homes from attacks by ""violent groups."" 
Local media reported at least six people were wounded.
About 300 people have been jailed since protests erupted in April, according to local human rights activists. More than 300 people were killed during those protests in crackdowns by Nicaraguan police and armed groups backing the government, human rights groups have said.
The protests began after Ortega's leftist government moved to reduce welfare benefits, but soon escalated into broader opposition against Ortega, who has been in office since 2007. He also held power in the 1980s during Nicaragua's civil war. 
The current violence is the worst since his Sandinista government battled U.S.-backed ""Contra"" rebels in the 1980s.
In a speech on Saturday, Ortega said he would not call early elections ahead of a scheduled 2021 vote. Nicaragua's main business lobby and other groups have urged Ortega to bring forward elections to help the country emerge from the crisis. 
Ortega said previous national strikes had ""seriously hurt"" the economy and he warned business leaders not to support another strike. He accused business owners of lying when they said demonstrators had threatened to burn their establishments. 

""The next time, then, we are going to send the police so that they keep their doors open,"" Ortega said. ""This idea that their businesses will be burned is a lie, an invention that they themselves make to justify the closures.""

General Assembly, state-run media reported.
Tensions have heightened between the Cold War foes after U.S. President Donald Trump tightened the embargo last year following the resumption of diplomatic relations under his predecessor, Barack Obama. Washington also alleged a series of health attacks had taken place on U.S. diplomats in Havana. 
The Cuban government has said no attacks occurred and that the Trump administration was using whatever did occur - if indeed anything did - as a pretext to escalate its hostile stance on the Communist-run island. 
Diaz-Canel, who took over the presidency from his mentor, Raul Castro, in April, will address the UNGA Nelson Mandela Peace Summit on Monday and the General Assembly on Wednesday, according to state-run outlet Cubadebate.
At that session, Cuba will present for the 27th year running a resolution calling for the end of the U.S. trade embargo on the island nation.
""We bring the voice of Cuba that above all comes to denounce the abnormal policy of the blockade, a policy that has already failed, that will continue to fail, and that is the longest blockade in the history of humanity,"" Diaz-Canel said on arrival, according to the Cuban Foreign Ministry.
Diaz-Canel's statements on the United States, as on other political matters, have so far largely echoed those of his predecessor, who remains head of the Communist Party until 2021. 
The non-binding U.N. resolution urges the United States to repeal the embargo on Cuba as soon as possible. Only the U.S. Congress can lift the full embargo, put in place more than 50 years ago.
Through the week, Diaz-Canel will meet with other foreign leaders, as well as New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, U.S. supporters of engagement with Cuba and members of the Cuban-American community, Cubadebate said. He will also speak on Wednesday night at New York's historic Riverside Church. 

Diaz-Canel made his first trip abroad as president to Cuba's main ally, Venezuela, in May.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition resolved a dispute over Germany's scandal-tainted spymaster on Sunday, ending a crisis that had prompted concerns the six-month-old government could fall apart.
The three coalition parties had agreed on Tuesday to transfer spy chief Hans-Georg Maassen to the Interior Ministry following accusations that he harbored far-right views. Maassen had questioned the authenticity of video footage showing radicals hounding migrants in the eastern city of Chemnitz.
But their decision sparked public outrage because the senior post they picked for Maassen came with a pay rise. Some members of the Social Democrats (SPD) -- the junior partner in Merkel's coalition -- had called for their party to quit the alliance if the decision was not revoked.
The deal unraveled on Friday when Andrea Nahles, leader of the center-left SPD, said it was a mistake. A poll published on Thursday had shown 72 percent of voters had less confidence in the government after the clumsy compromise.
After a meeting between the party leaders on Sunday to hammer out a new compromise, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said they had agreed Maassen would work in the Interior Ministry in future but would not receive a pay rise.
Seehofer said Maassen would be a special advisor focusing on European and international tasks. Before the meeting some SPD members had insisted that Maassen should not be responsible for security or migration issues in his new role. 
Seehofer said the decision about pay was a response to the heavy public criticism of the initial plan, but insisted the coalition had not been at risk of falling apart over the affair.
After the coalition's third crisis meeting in 10 days, SPD leader Nahles said in a statement: ""The coalition will now dedicate itself to daily business again. We have a lot to do.""
COALITION TROUBLES
The dispute over Maassen comes just two months after Merkel ended a painful row with Seehofer's Bavarian CSU over immigration, related to her decision in 2015 to open Germany's borders to hundreds of thousands of migrants.
And the coalition is still divided over how to tackle the problem of diesel cars with high nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. A government source said the coalition committee would meet on Oct. 1 to discuss issues including diesel.
Carmakers and German government representatives failed to reach a compromise on Sunday over potential hardware retrofits for older diesel vehicles, with the transport minister saying further talks would take place in the coming week.
EU Budget Commissioner Guenther Oettinger, a member of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), had earlier complained that a year in Europe had been wasted since Germans voted. He said other EU countries expected the government of Europe's largest economy to finally start dealing with European issues.
""It is getting ever harder to explain to European partners ... why the grand coalition keeps getting entangled in new conflicts which are actually of little significance,"" Oettinger told the Funke newspaper group in an interview published on Sunday.
Wolfgang Kubicki, deputy leader of the opposition Free Democrats, said earlier on Sunday the saga showed the alliance had deeper problems, and new elections should be called.
CDU general secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer had written to party members to say the CDU thought Sunday's talks should be used to clarify whether the coalition partners ""can continue to unite together behind the common mission"".

An Emnid poll had on Saturday shown combined support for Merkel's CDU and Seehofer's Christian Social Union (CSU) slumping to a record low of 28 percent, while the far-right Alternative for Germany -- which has backed Maassen -- was at 16 percent, just behind the SPD on 17 percent.

689,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2018 03:55PM ET</span>",Panama revokes registration of last migrant rescue ship in central Mediterranean,"MILAN (Reuters) - The Panama Maritime Authority has revoked the registration of search and rescue ship Aquarius 2 in a move that means there will be no charity rescue ships off the Libyan coast in the near future unless the vessel can find a new flag to sail under.
Aquarius 2, the one remaining charity rescue vessel still operating in the Central Mediterranean area, is currently at sea with 58 survivors on board.
The decision by the Panama Authority (PMA) means that once the ship comes into port it will be deflagged and will not be allowed to operate again unless it can find a new flag.
SOS Mediterranee, one of the charities that operates the Aquarius, said in a statement it was reeling from news of the revocation, which it said followed pressure from the Italian government.
""On Saturday ... the Aquarius team was shocked to learn of an official communication from the Panamanian authorities stating that the Italian authorities had urged the PMA to take 'immediate action' against the Aquarius,"" it said.
Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said the Italian government had applied no pressure on Panama.
A public backlash against the arrival of hundreds of thousands of seaborne newcomers in the past five years helped put Italy's anti-establishment ruling coalition into office. 
Salvini has led a popular crackdown against immigration since his League party and the anti-establishment 5 Star Movement took office in June.
Salvini has previously accused SOS Mediterranee and other charities of acting like a Mediterranean ""taxi service"" for the migrants.
Salvini said on Sunday that Aquarius 2 had hindered the work of the Libyan coast guard, ignoring instructions.
He said that, according to newspapers, Aquarius 2 was about to have its registration revoked by Panama because it was ""illegal and does not respect procedures"".
""They can change their name and flag another thousand times but Italy's ports will remain shut to these gentlemen,"" he said.
Italy has previously attacked the European Union for its lack of support on immigration and has threatened to refuse to back the bloc’s multi-year budget.

The ferry, MV Nyerere, sank on Thursday evening just a few meters from the dock on Ukerewe, the lake's biggest island.
Works, Transport and Communication Minister Isack Kamwelwe told state broadcaster TBC the death toll had risen to 224 as of Sunday afternoon. 
The definitive cause of the capsizing is not yet known but officials have said preliminary investigation shows the ferry was carrying more people than legally permitted.
Boat accidents on Lake Victoria, which is shared by the East African countries of Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya, are common often caused by lax safety laws, weak enforcement and old and poorly maintained vessels. 
Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa told TBC officials involved in managing the ferry had been detained.
""The government will form a special investigation commission of experts which will investigate the source of the accident and legal measures will be taken against all who were involved in causing the tragedy,"" he said. 
A search and rescue team has been attempting to flip the ship, which is belly up in the waters, back to its normal position so it can be towed to the dock. General Venance Mabeyo, the head of the military, said this could take two to three days.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards vowed on Sunday to exact ""deadly and unforgettable"" vengeance for an attack on a military parade that killed 25 people, including 12 of their comrades, and Tehran accused Gulf Arab states of backing the gunmen.
Saturday's assault, one of the worst ever against the most powerful force of the Islamic Republic, struck a blow at its security establishment at a time when the United States and its Gulf allies are working to isolate Tehran. 
""Considering (the Guards') full knowledge about the centers of deployment of the criminal terrorists' leaders ..., they will face a deadly and unforgettable vengeance in the near future,"" the Guards said in a statement carried by state media. 
Four assailants fired on a viewing stand in the southwestern city of Ahvaz where Iranian officials had gathered to watch an annual event marking the start of the Islamic Republic's 1980-88 war with Iraq. Soldiers crawled about as gunfire crackled. Women and children fled for their lives.
Islamic State's Amaq agency posted a video of three men in a vehicle who it said were on their way to carry out the attack.
A man wearing a baseball cap emblazoned with what appears to be a Revolutionary Guard logo discussed the impending attack in Farsi in the video. ""We are Muslims, they are kafirs (non-believers),"" the man says. He adds: ""We will destroy them with a strong and guerrilla-style attack, inshallah (God willing).""
Ahvaz National Resistance, an Iranian ethnic Arab opposition movement which seeks a separate state in oil-rich Khuzestan province, also claimed responsibility for the attack.
Neither of them provided evidence.
There has been a blizzard of furious statements from top Iranian officials, including President Hassan Rouhani, accusing Iran's adversaries the United States and Gulf states of provoking the bloodshed and threatening a tough response.
Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, rejected Rouhani's accusations.
""He's got the Iranian people ... protesting, every ounce of money that goes into Iran goes into his military, he has oppressed his people for a long time and he needs to look at his own base to figure out where that's coming from,"" she told CNN.
DETAINING ACTIVISTS
Senior commanders of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) have said the Ahvaz attack was carried out by militants trained by Gulf states and Israel, and backed by America. But it is unlikely the IRGC will strike any of these foes directly.
The Guards could put on a show of strength by firing missiles at opposition groups operating in Iraq or Syria that may be linked to the militants who staged the attack.
They are also likely to enforce a tight security policy in Khuzestan province, arresting any perceived domestic opponents including civil rights activists. 
Three Arab activists told Reuters that security forces, especially the intelligence branch of the Revolutionary Guards, had detained more activists in Ahvaz. 
Rouhani engineered Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that ushered in a cautious detente with Washington before tensions flared anew with President Donald Trump's decision in May to pull out of the accord and reimpose sanctions on Tehran.
The attack on the military parade is likely to give security hardliners like the Guards more political ammunition because they did not endorse the pragmatist Rouhani's pursuit of the nuclear deal with the West, analysts say.
In New York, Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said on Saturday that U.S. sanctions were inflicting economic pain on Iran that could lead to a ""successful revolution"".
The Trump administration has said that changing Iran's system of government is not U.S. policy.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News on Sunday that Trump was willing to meet top Iranian officials for talks.
Asked if Trump would like to meet with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, Pompeo replied: ""The president has said he'll talk with anyone if we can have a constructive conversation.""
Mostly Shi'ite Muslim Iran is at odds with Western-allied Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia for predominance in the Middle East. The regional superpowers support opposing sides in the civil wars in Yemen and Syria, as well as rival political groups in Iraq and Lebanon.
A senior United Arab Emirates official denied Iranian allegations alluding to the involvement of the UAE in training gunmen that claimed the attack. 

The ""formal incitement against the UAE from within Iran is unfortunate, and has escalated after the Ahvaz attack,"" Minister of State for Foreign Affairs for the United Arab Emirates Anwar Gargash said in a tweet.

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - At least 115 people have been killed and 383 injured in month-long clashes between rival factions in Tripoli, Libya’s health ministry said on Sunday.
The fighting pitted the Seventh Brigade, or Kaniyat, from Tarhouna, a town 65 km (45 miles) southeast of Tripoli, against the Tripoli Revolutionaries’ Brigades (TRB) and the Nawasi, two of the capital’s largest armed groups.
Tripoli and western Libya are run by a U.N.-backed government mainly supported by armed groups, while Eastern Libya is controlled by a rival administration. The country has been riven since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011.
The Kaniyat and other groups from outside Tripoli launched an assault on the capital in late August amid unease over reports of the wealth, power and extravagant lifestyles of some Tripoli militia commanders.
At the Frontline in Tripoli’s southern residential areas of Wadi Rabea and Fatma Zahra, shelled houses, torched vehicles, destroyed shops and deserted streets attest to the intensity of the clashes.
“The death toll could surge because of the critical condition of the injured and the continuing fighting,” Wedad Abo Al-Niran, media officer at the health ministry told Reuters.
The armed groups which claim official status through the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli patrol the area in armored vehicles and pickup trucks mounted with anti-aircraft guns.
The fighting has knocked out most power stations in the city and crippled Tripoli’s main airport.
Although civilian targets continue to be shelled, Hakeem Al-Sheikh, commander of 42 Brigade loyal to GNA, said “the situation is under control.”
Meanwhile residents in southern Tripoli continue to bear the brunt of the infighting, with many forced to flee their homes.
“We are staying with our relatives as we are afraid of looting acts,” said Abdulqader al-Ryani, a father of three who left everything behind when he left his house.
So far, calls by the GNA for all sides to uphold a ceasefire agreed on Sept. 4 have fallen on deaf ears.
Adding to the existing tensions, a coalition of armed groups including Misrata military council promised on Saturday to fight alongside Tarhouna's Seventh Brigade saying that they ""reject the rule of militias inside Tripoli.""

694,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2018 11:37AM ET</span>",UK opposition leader will back second Brexit vote if party wants it,"By Elizabeth Piper and Kylie MacLellan
LIVERPOOL, England (Reuters) - British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said on Sunday he would back a second Brexit referendum if his Labour Party votes to pursue the move, heaping pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May, whose plans for a divorce deal with the EU have hit an impasse.
Corbyn, a veteran eurosceptic, has resisted growing demands to back a new ""People's Vote"" on the decision to quit the European Union, keen to keep those party members on board who voted in favor of Brexit at a 2016 referendum. 
But the political landscape has changed since May's plans for Brexit -- the biggest shift in British policy for more than four decades -- were resoundingly rebuffed by the EU on Thursday, with any outcome of the negotiations more uncertain than ever.
With talk of a new election swirling after May's ""Chequers"" plan was all but shredded at an EU summit last week and chances of a disorderly departure that could damage the economy rising, the opposition party is under pressure to set the Brexit agenda.
At Labour's annual conference in the northern city of Liverpool, Corbyn, who in 1975 voted ""No"" to Britain's membership of the then-European Community, said he would act on the result of a debate in Labour on a second Brexit vote. But he was clear that he preferred a new election.
""Our preference would be for a general election and we can then negotiate our future relationship with Europe but let's see what comes out of conference,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, saying Labour was ready to vote against any deal.
""Obviously I’m bound by the democracy of our party.""
Labour is expected to discuss several motions on Brexit at its conference, and it remains unclear what the proposal on a second referendum might be -- it could be a clear backing of a vote or something less black-and-white.
Corbyn has long said that a ""People's Vote"" is not off the table for his party, and a source close to the leadership urged caution over an as-yet unknown motion, repeating the Labour leader's stance that he does not support a second referendum.
Len McCluskey, a Corbyn ally and leader of Britain's biggest trade union Unite, further muddied the water when he said any such second referendum ""shouldn't be on: 'Do we want to go back into the European Union?'"", adding people had voted in 2016 when Britain backed leaving the EU by a narrow 52-48 percent.
NEW ELECTION?
Corbyn wanted his conference to be an opportunity to sell his alternative vision for Britain's economy, pressing his argument for the renationalization of rail, mail and utilities, and to rally the party for a possible early election. 
But with Britain due to leave the EU in March, Brexit was likely to dominate the conference. 
Thousands of supporters of a second vote marched through Liverpool's streets on Sunday to make their feelings known.
After weeks of both EU and British officials making positive noises about the prospects of clinching a divorce deal and one on a future trading relationship, the mood turned sour on Thursday in Salzburg, Austria when EU leaders came out, one by one, to criticize ""Chequers"" as unrealistic.
A tacit deal to try to offer her some support before she heads to what is going to be a difficult annual conference of her Conservative Party later this month was broken by some British diplomatic missteps.
May says she will hold her nerve in the talks, pressing the EU to come up with an alternative proposal to her Chequers plan, named after the prime minister's country residence where a deal was hashed out with her top ministers in July.
But the impasse with the EU has prompted some to predict an early election -- a notion Brexit minister Dominic Raab said was ""for the birds"".
While saying she will stick to her guns, May might have little chance but to change tack after a party conference where the deep divisions over Europe that have riven her Conservatives for decades will be in plain sight.
A senior pro-EU Conservative lawmaker, Nicky Morgan, said May would have to give ground on trade and customs arrangements with the EU to overcome the biggest hurdle to a withdrawal accord -- the prevention of a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and Ireland, a member of the EU.
And if Labour's Corbyn does come out with clear support for a second referendum, the pressure on the Conservatives to get any deal through parliament will only grow.

""We would vote it down if it didn't meet our tests in order to send the government, if it is still in office, straight back to the negotiating table,"" Corbyn said. ""And if there is a general election and we are in office we would go straight to the negotiating table.""

Full-face coverings such as niqabs and burqas are a polarizing issue across Europe, with some arguing that they symbolize discrimination against women and should be outlawed. The clothing has already been banned in France and Denmark. 
Under the Swiss system of direct democracy, voters in the northeastern canton demanded tightening the law to punish those who cover their faces in public and thus ""threaten or endanger public security or religious or social peace"".
The regional government, which had opposed the measure, now has to implement the result of the vote, which drew turnout of around 36 percent.
Switzerland's largest Islamic organization, the Islamic Central Council, recommended women continue to cover their faces. It said it would closely monitor the implementation of the ban and consider legal action if necessary.
The Swiss federal government in June opposed a grassroots campaign for a nationwide ban on facial coverings.
The Swiss cabinet said individual cantons should decide on the matter, but it will nevertheless go to a nationwide vote after activists last year collected more than the required 100,000 signatures to trigger a referendum.
Two-thirds of Switzerland's 8.5 million residents identify as Christians. But its Muslim population has risen to 5 percent, largely because of immigrants from former Yugoslavia.

One Swiss canton, Italian-speaking Ticino, already has a similar ban, while two others have rejected it.

KAUNAS, Lithuania (Reuters) - Pope Francis said on Sunday that society should be vigilant for ""any whiff"" of resurgent anti-Semitism, calling for new generations to be taught the horrors of the Holocaust.
He made his appeal in Kaunas, Lithuania's second city, on the 75th anniversary of the wartime liquidation of the ghetto in the capital Vilnius. Two years of Nazi oppression in which tens of thousands of Jews were killed or deported culminated on Sept. 23-24, 1943.
""The Jewish people suffered insults and cruel punishments,"" Francis told a crowd of about 100,000 at an open-air Mass.
""Let us ... ask the Lord to give us the gift of discernment to detect in time any seed of that pernicious attitude, any whiff of it that can taint the heart of generations that did not experience those times,"" he said.
Francis, who was due to visit a monument to the ghetto victims later on the second day of a four-day visit to the Baltic states, was using the anniversary to make a broader appeal beyond Lithuania, a papal aide said.
Reports of anti-Semitic acts have increased in Europe, coinciding with the rise of populist, right-wing parties in a number of countries.
In May, Germany reported 1,504 anti-Semitic offences for 2017, up from 1,468 in 2016. The previous month, thousands of Germans wearing skull caps took part in nationwide rallies in support of the Jewish community.
France was shocked in March by the murder a Holocaust survivor in a suspected anti-Semitic attack, and Britain's main opposition Labour Party is embroiled in an anti-Semitism row.
More 200,000 Lithuanian Jews were murdered by the Nazis, aided by some locals. The country's Jewish community today numbers about 3,000.
In the homily of the Mass, Francis referred to those who collaborated with the Nazis in World War Two or with Communist authorities in the period between 1944 and 1991 when Lithuania was part of the Soviet Union.
""Earlier generations still bear the scars of the period of the occupation, anguish at those who were deported, uncertainty about those who never returned, shame for those who were informers and traitors,"" he said.
On Sunday afternoon the pope was visiting the Museum of Occupations and Fights for Freedom, a former Soviet KGB prison in Vilnius where hundreds were murdered and thousands, including many priests, shipped off to Siberia.
In Riga, Francis will pay tribute to Latvia's independence heroes at the Monument to Freedom and preside over at an ecumenical service at the city's Lutheran cathedral.
In Tallinn, Estonia, he will say Mass in Freedom Square (NYSE:SQ), the site of military parades in Soviet times was where thousands of candles are burned each year to commemorate Soviet deportees.

The Vatican on Saturday signed an agreement giving it a long-desired and decisive say in the appointment of bishops in China, though critics labeled it a sellout to the government.
China's around 12 million Catholics have been split between an underground Church swearing loyalty to the Vatican and the state-supervised Catholic Patriotic Association.
The Catholic Church in China said it would ""persevere to walk a path suited to a socialist society, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.""
It ""deeply loved the motherland"" and ""sincerely endorsed"" the agreement, hoping relations between China and the Vatican would improve further, it added in comments on its website. 
The Vatican has said the accord, a breakthrough after years of negotiations, was ""not political but pastoral"", and hoped it would lead to ""the full communion of all Chinese Catholics.""
But prospects of such an agreement had divided communities of Catholics across China, some of whom fear greater suppression should the Vatican cede more control to Beijing. Others want to see rapprochement and avoid a potential schism.

Turkey is seeking to improve its awkward relationship with Europe at a time when its ties with the United States have deteriorated and the lira has been falling sharply.
Erdogan is also traveling to the U.S. to attend a United Nations meeting and will meet with U.S. investors before visiting Germany between Sept. 27 and 29.

""It will (also) be the steps that can be taken to carry our economic ties further on a mutually beneficial basis.""
Relations between Germany and Turkey deteriorated after a post-coup crackdown in Turkey that has seen tens of thousands of people imprisoned since 2016, including some German citizens. 
There has been a slight thaw in recent months since Turkey released one German-Turkish journalist and allowed another German citizen to leave the country.
Germany is home to a three-million-strong Turkish diaspora, the world's largest, many of whom have dual citizenship. German officials believe they have little choice but to improve ties, despite concerns over human rights in Turkey.
German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said after meeting with his Turkish counterpart on Friday that Erdogan will not ask for economic aid when he meets Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Turkey's lira has lost nearly 40 percent of its value this year on concerns over Erdogan's grip on monetary policy. More recently Ankara has accused the U.S. of waging ""economic war"" amid a bitter standoff between the NATO allies over the fate of a Christian pastor detained by Ankara.

Erdogan also met with representatives from U.S. companies in Ankara on Wednesday.

Khan al-Ahmar consists of tin and wood shacks built on a desert hillside beside an Israeli highway that runs from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea.
Israel plans to demolish the village and relocate its 180 residents - Bedouins who scrape a living by raising sheep and goats - to a site 12 kilometers (7 miles) away, near the Palestinian village of Abu Dis and adjacent to a landfill site.
The move has drawn criticism from Palestinians and some European states, who cite the impact on the community and prospects for peace. 
A spokeswoman for Israel's military liaison agency with the Palestinians said no date had been set for demolition should the houses remain after the deadline.
Israeli security forces on Sunday morning handed out letters telling residents to voluntarily take down the buildings by Oct. 1 or Israeli authorities would enforce the demolition orders.
""We will not voluntarily evacuate the place,"" said village resident Faisal Abu Dahuk. ""The occupation forces that have an army and weapons can evacuate us by force, but there is no other place to go and we refuse to be moved anywhere else.""
Israel's Supreme Court has rejected petitions to prevent the move, siding with the authorities which say the village was built without the required permits. Palestinians say such documents are impossible to obtain.

Palestinians say the demolition is part of an Israeli push to create an arc of settlements that would effectively cut off East Jerusalem from the West Bank, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and which the Palestinians seek for an independent state.

While the Huras al-Din faction is not the main Islamist militant group in Idlib, its statement points to objections that may complicate the implementation of the agreement clinched last week by Russia and Turkey.
The most powerful jihadist group in the northwest, Tahrir al-Sham, has yet to declare its stance on the deal, under which insurgents must vacate the demilitarized zone by Oct. 15. 
Tahrir al-Sham is a coalition of Islamist groups dominated by the faction formerly known as the Nusra Front, which was an official wing of the al Qaeda network until 2016. Tahrir al-Sham's position will be critical.
An alliance of Turkey-allied rebel groups, the National Front for Liberation, has declared its ""complete cooperation"" with the Turkish effort, but has also ruled out disarming or yielding territory.
The Huras al-Din group was formed earlier this year by combatants who split from Tahrir al-Sham and the Nusra Front when it cut its ties with al Qaeda. It includes foreign militants.
The group declared the agreement part of a plan ""to eliminate the jihadist project"" in the Levant.
""We advise our mujahideen brothers in this decisive and dangerous phase ... (to) begin military operations against the enemies of religion to thwart their plans,"" it said in a statement released on Saturday.
The demilitarized zone agreed by Turkey and Russia will be 15 to 20 km (10 to 12 miles) deep and run along the contact line between rebel and government fighters. It will be patrolled by Turkish and Russian forces.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that all opposition heavy weapons, mortars, tanks and rocket systems are to be removed from the zone by Oct. 10.

The naval medical ship, known as the ""Peace Ark"", arrived on Saturday at the Venezuelan port of La Guaira for an eight-day period of ""friendly visits"" to the country, the official Xinhua news agency said on Sunday.
Maduro, whose leftist government is under fire in Venezuela as the economy struggles with a fifth year of recession and hyperinflation, visited China earlier in September. China's leaders pledged to help but made no reference to extending him new funds.
China has been a major backer of Venezuela over the years, with more than a decade of oil-for-loan agreements that helped China secure energy supplies for its fast-growing economy while bolstering an anti-U.S. ally in Latin America.
However, the flow of cash halted nearly three years ago, when Venezuela asked for a change of payment terms amid falling oil prices and declining crude output that pushed its state-led economy into a hyperinflationary collapse.
Venezuela's finance ministry said in July it would receive $250 million from the China Development Bank to boost oil production but offered no details. Venezuela previously accepted a $5 billion loan from China for its struggling oil sector but has yet to receive the entire amount.

Xinhua said that during the visit the Chinese commander of the ship would visit military and political officials and inspect Venezuelan military and medical facilities.

Only 29 percent of those surveyed in September said they were satisfied with President Macron, down from 34 percent last month and 39 percent two months ago, the Ifop poll for Le Journal du Dimanche found.
Macron's popularity is low in most polls. The former investment banker won the 2017 election with 66.1 percent of the vote on a reformist project to modernize the eurozone's second-largest power, but many voters ranging from conservative pensioners to low-income workers complain his policies mostly benefit companies and the rich.
The president was criticised last week for telling an unemployed man he could easily get a job if he tried. [nL8N1W331Q]
Macron was dealt a blow earlier this month with the surprise resignation of his environment minister, Nicolas Hulot, a popular former activist and TV presenter. And on Sept. 18 interior minister Gerard Collomb, one of Macron's closest allies, announced plans to run for election as mayor of Lyon in 2020.

The Ifop poll was conducted on Sept. 14-22 with a sample of 1,964 people.

MALE (Reuters) - The Maldives voted on Sunday in an election in which hardline President Abdulla Yameen is expected to cement his grip on power but which opposition and international groups have criticized for a lack of transparency and suppression of dissent.
The Muslim-majority Indian Ocean nation has become a theater of rivalry between its traditional partner, India, and China, which has backed Yameen's infrastructure drive, and prompted concern in the West about Beijing's increasing influence.
Yameen's government has jailed many of his main rivals, including former president and his half brother, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, on charges ranging from terrorism to corruption.
More than a quarter of a million people were eligible to vote in around 400 polling booths across the coral islands, best known in the West for their luxury resorts. Yameen, 59, is seeking a second five-year term.
Hundreds of people queued outside polling stations in the capital, Male, early on Sunday. On some islands, people started queuing on Saturday night. 
""I am voting to revert a mistake I made in 2013. I am voting to free President Maumoon (Gayoom),"" Nazima Hassan, 44, told Reuters after voting in Male.
Abdul Rasheed Husain, 46, in Male said he cast his ballot for Yameen to take the Maldives ""to the next level"".
Police late on Saturday raided the main opposition campaign office saying they came to ""stop illegal activities"", after arresting at least five opposition supporters for ""influencing voters"", opposition officials said. 
British Ambassador James Duaris said in a twitter message said that it was ""easy to understand why so many people are concerned about what might happen on Election Day"".
INTERNATIONAL MONITORS STAY AWAY
Most poll monitors including those from the European Union and the United Nations declined the government's invitation to observe the election, fearing their presence might be used to endorse Yameen's re-election even after possible vote rigging.
Transparency Maldives, one of the few election monitors on the ground which had reiterated concerns about the fairness of the electoral rules, said the vote had gone smoothly.
""Observers concluded that the polling stations were set up to ensure a secret vote in the vast majority of cases (99 percent). This was less clear in about 1 percent of all cases observed. These polling stations will be closely watched.""
The opposition's joint candidate, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, known as Ibu, told supporters he was confident of victory.
""I appeal to everyone not to allow any space for unrest tomorrow,"" he told a rally on Saturday. ""Let the voting end peacefully and let the people decide what they want. The people are hungry for a change.""
Preliminary results are expected by midnight (1900 GMT).
Yameen also urged voters to head to the polls and said he was confident of the work he had done in his first term in office to put the nation on a path of development. 
The country has been in political turmoil since February, when Yameen imposed a state of emergency to annul a Supreme Court ruling that quashed the convictions of nine opposition leaders, including Mohamed Nasheed, the country's first democratically elected leader and former president.
Yameen has disregarded calls from the United Nations, several Western countries and India for an amicable solution to the crisis. 
Ahead of the vote, Human Rights Watch urged foreign governments to press the Maldives to uphold democratic rights.

""Should the Maldives government fail to do so, they should impose targeted sanctions, such as those proposed by the European Union, against senior ruling party officials implicated in abuses,"" the New York-based group said in a statement.

709,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 23, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",Explainer: Why nuclear disclosure is key first step in North Korea's denuclearization,"By Hyonhee Shin and David Brunnstrom
SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New pledges made last week by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to curb his nuclear weapons program may have opened the door to further talks with Washington, but just how much impact would they have on the North's nuclear arsenal?
At last week's summit with South Korea's President Moon Jae-in, Kim promised to allow outside inspections on key missile facilities, and expressed a willingness, for the first time, to ""permanently"" scrap North Korea's main nuclear complex.
Graphic: Nuclear North Korea - http://tmsnrt.rs/2lE5yjF
While these are positive first steps, experts say they would do little to damage the country's larger nuclear and missile capabilities, nor demonstrate whether Kim is serious about giving up his nuclear arsenal.
The agreement by Kim and Moon also does not stipulate any plans by North Korea to declare a list of its nuclear weapons, facilities and materials, or a concrete timeline for denuclearization.
With U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expected to meet his North Korean counterpart Ri Yong Ho to restart nuclear talks as soon as this week on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, here is a summary of Pyongyang's nuclear and missile capabilities at stake. 
YONGBYON
In the joint statement, the North expressed its willingness to ""permanently dismantle"" the Yongbyon nuclear complex if the United States takes corresponding action. Moon said this would include a declaration of an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War. 
A sprawling complex located about 100 km (60 miles) north of the capital, Yongbyon is the country's main nuclear facility and the birthplace of its nuclear programs.
Built in the late 1950s with Soviet aid, it houses at least three reactors, fissile materials, fuel re-processing plants and a multitude of research labs, according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), a Washington-based think tank.
An operational five-megawatt reactor there produces weapons-grade plutonium, while there is also a facility to produce highly enriched uranium (HEU), also used to make atomic bombs, experts say. 
Dismantling Yongbyon would slow the production of fissile material, but not reduce the current stockpile of plutonium and HEU, nor clear suspicions of other secret production sites, says Joshua Pollack, a North Korea missile expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California.
""Yongbyon is where all of North Korea's plutonium production has taken place, so this step would effectively cap their stockpile of plutonium,"" Pollack said.
""Unfortunately, it would neither reduce their current plutonium stockpile nor address the production of highly enriched uranium, which most experts believe happens both at Yongbyon and at one or more other sites.""
North Korea has denied the existence of other secret sites, but U.S. media reports, citing intelligence sources, said in recent months the North has been running at least one covert uranium enrichment facility just outside of Pyongyang, known as the Kangson enrichment site.
""But there is still value in being able to verifiably shut down the known facilities with a negotiated mechanism for inspecting suspected sites,"" said Jenny Town, managing editor of the Washington-based Stimson Centre's 38 North project, which provides satellite imagery analyses of the North's weapons facilities. 
TONGCHANG-RI 
North Korea also said it will ""permanently dismantle"" its missile engine testing site and launch platform in the northwestern town of Tongchang-ri in the presence of experts from ""concerned countries"".
Also known as the Sohae satellite launching station, this site has been the country’s primary site for rocket launches since 2012. It is where the North last year test-fired intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) designed to reach the U.S. mainland.
The facility consists of a missile assembly building, a launch pad with a gantry and mobile launch platform, fuel and oxidizer storage, a rocket engine test stand and an instrumentation stand, according to NTI.
In July, after the Singapore summit between Kim and Trump, satellite imagery indicated the North has begun dismantling the engine test site in Tongchang-ri, but without allowing outsiders access for verification. 
While it has served as a key test center for liquid fuel engines designed for long-range missiles and played an important role in the country's ICBM development, Sohae's importance may be diminishing, experts say. Pyongyang, having declared its newest ICBM complete in November, has called for mass production to begin.
The North has also been moving toward solid-fuel missiles that can be fired from harder-to-detect mobile launchers, making a fixed stand increasingly unnecessary. There is also at least one other operational missile launch station, Tonghae or Musudan-ri in the northeast, though it has not been used since 2009.
""Neither that engine test site nor launch platform would be U.S. priorities,"" said Lee Ho-ryung, head of North Korea military studies at the Korea Institute for Defence Analyses in Seoul. ""Maybe a political message to the United States, but that would hardly make meaningful steps toward denuclearization.""
EXISTING NUCLEAR STOCKPILE
Estimates on how many nuclear weapons North Korea vary. U.S. intelligence officials have put it at between 30 and 60 warheads, while South Korea's intelligence agency said last month the North may have as many as 100 warheads.
38 North, which estimates North Korea has 50-60 nuclear warheads, said last year the operational Yongbyon reactor is capable of producing around 6 kg of plutonium every year, enough to make about two bombs.
The suspected continuation of production makes it an urgent task to get Pyongyang to first freeze nuclear and missile production, as well as convince it to declare all related facilities for verification, experts say.
""How far the North would go to disclose its facilities would be key,"" said Kim Dae-young, a military analyst at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy in Seoul. 

""Though it may be implausible to rid them completely of nuclear capabilities, it's crucial to make it impossible for them to build the bombs again, including through regular inspections.""

710,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2018 11:24PM ET</span>",All aboard: Hong Kong bullet train signals high-speed integration with China,"By Donny Kwok
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's controversial bullet train got off to a smooth start on Sunday, as hundreds of passengers whistled north across the border at speeds of up to 200 kph (125 mph), deepening integration of the former British colony with mainland China. 
While the $11 billion rail project has raised fears for some over Beijing's encroachment on the Chinese-ruled city's cherished freedoms, passengers at the sleek harbourfront station were full of praise for a service that reaches mainland China in less than 20 minutes. 
""Out of 10 points, I give it nine,"" said 10-year-old Ng Kwan-lap, who was traveling with his parents on the first train leaving for Shenzhen at 7 a.m. 
""The train is great. It's very smooth when it hits speeds of 200 kilometers per hour.""
Mainland Chinese immigration officers are stationed in one part of the modernist station that is subject to Chinese law, an unprecedented move that some critics say further erodes the city's autonomy.
The project is part of a broader effort by Beijing to 
fuse the city into a vast hinterland of the Pearl River Delta including nine Chinese cities dubbed the Greater Bay Area. 
Beijing wants the Greater Bay Area, home to some 68 million people with a combined GDP of $1.5 trillion, to foster economic integration and better meld people, goods and sectors across the region. 
Critics say the railway is a symbol of continuing Chinese assimilation of Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with guarantees of widespread autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent legal system.
But at a ceremony on Saturday ahead of the public opening, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam praised the so-called ""co-location"" arrangement with Beijing which the government has said is necessary to streamline immigration.
Scores of excited passengers straddled a yellow strip across black tiles that highlighted the demarcation line between Hong Kong and mainland China, while others passed through turnstiles surrounded by red, orange and white balloons.
""I'm excited to experience the high-speed train, even more excited than when I take a plane,"" said a 71-year-old retiree surnamed Leung. 
While there have been questions over whether Hong Kong residents would be able to access foreign social media, largely banned in mainland China, in zones subject to Chinese law, some passengers arriving in Shenzhen, on the mainland side, were able to bypass China's so-called Great Firewall. 
The rail link provides direct access to China's massive 25,000-km national high-speed rail network and authorities on both sides have hailed it as a breakthrough that will bring economic benefits, including increased tourism.
""No matter what you think about the new line, high-speed rail is extremely convenient,"" said Feng Yan, assistant professor at the Communication University of China in Beijing who took the bullet train from Shenzhen to Hong Kong. 

""Even if it takes some time for people to realize how convenient it is, sooner or later they will.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Saturday that Washington would not wait to impose sanctions on any shippers helping to get fuel to North Korea, in an apparent warning to Russia days after the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations accused Moscow of cheating on the measures.
North Korea continues to employ tactics to evade U.N. sanctions, Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement, adding that U.N. member states are required to prohibit ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum fuel to the hermit country.
""The United States will not hesitate to impose sanctions on any individual, entity, or vessel supporting North Korea's illicit activities, regardless of nationality,"" Nauert said.
The 15-member U.N. Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. 
But the United States and Russia have recently shown cracks in the unity of the council over the sanctions.
Washington has ""evidence of consistent and wide-ranging Russian violations"" of the sanctions, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley said on Monday. Russia was helping North Korea illegally obtain fuel through transfers at sea, had refused to expel a North Korean whom the Security Council blacklisted last year, and had pushed for changes to an independent U.N. report on sanctions violations to cover up breaches by Russians, she said.
Russia said after Haley's comments that Moscow had not pressured the authors of the U.N. report and blamed Haley for heightening tensions.
With the warning on fuel shipments, the Trump administration signaled it was keeping pressure on Pyongyang even after saying there has been progress. President Donald Trump this week hailed a summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, and said there had been “tremendous progress” with North Korea on several fronts including Pyongyang's denuclearization. 
Washington has tracked some 148 cases this year of tankers delivering fuel to North Korea in breach of a U.N. cap of 500,000 barrels a year. Haley has not said how many of those transfers may have involved Russia. 
Both Russia and China have suggested the Security Council discuss easing sanctions after Trump and Kim met in June and Kim pledged to work toward denuclearization.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday the United States is working to set up another summit between Trump and Kim after their unprecedented meeting in Singapore, but there is still work to do.

Turkey and Russia struck a deal on Monday that will create a demilitarized zone between government and rebel fighters in northwestern Syria, sparing the area a major offensive for which pro-government forces had been mobilizing.
Under the agreement, ""radical"" insurgents must withdraw from the zone by Oct. 15. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the zone will be 15 to 20 km (10 to 12 miles) deep and run along the contact line between rebel and government fighters. 
It will be patrolled by Turkish and Russian forces.
The National Front for Liberation, which groups a number of Free Syrian Army factions deemed moderate by Turkey, announced ""our complete cooperation with the Turkish ally in making their effort succeed in sparing civilians the calamities of war"".
In a statement, it added ""we remain cautious and alert to any treachery by the Russians, the regime and the Iranians, especially after the issuance of statements by them that indicate this agreement is temporary"".
""Our finger will remain on the trigger and we will not forgo our weapons or our land or our revolution,"" it said.
Putin has said that all opposition heavy weapons, mortars, tanks, rocket systems are to be removed from the demilitarized zone by Oct. 10. 
Turkey has said the ""moderate opposition"" would keep its weapons and remain in the areas it holds, and the ""region will be cleared of radicals"".
The most powerful jihadist group in the northwest, Tahrir al-Sham, has yet to declare its position on the Turkish-Russian agreement. Tahrir al-Sham is an amalgamation of jihadists dominated by the group formerly known as the Nusra Front, which was an official affiliate of al Qaeda until 2016.
Close to 3 million people live in Idlib, around half of them Syrians displaced by the war from other parts of Syria, and the United Nations warned that an offensive would cause a humanitarian catastrophe.

K.T. McFarland's statement revised an earlier assertion to FBI agents that sanctions on Russia did not come up when she spoke to Flynn in December 2016 about his calls with Sergey Kislyak when he was the Russian ambassador to the United States, the newspaper said, quoting unidentified people familiar with the matter.
Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia and is cooperating in the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. He will be sentenced Dec. 18.
Mueller is looking at whether Flynn's conversations with Kislyak involved what U.S. intelligence agencies say was a Russian influence operation to throw the 2016 presidential vote to then-Republican candidate Donald Trump.
Trump denounces the probe as a ""witch hunt"" and Russia denies that it meddled in the election. 
One question Mueller is investigating is whether Flynn or other Trump aides discussed lifting U.S. sanctions on Russia in exchange for financial considerations.
McFarland’s account does not clarify what the president knew about Flynn’s interactions with Kislyak, the Post quoted its sources as saying.
The newspaper said McFarland did not return requests for comment. Her lawyer, Robert Giuffra, did not immediately return a request for comment.
Flynn, a former Army general who headed the Defense Intelligence Agency, was a Trump campaign aide and briefly served as his national security adviser. He was fired in February 2017 for misleading the administration about his contacts with Kislyak.
Speaking to FBI agents in the summer of 2017, McFarland, who briefly worked as Flynn's deputy, denied that sanctions arose in her discussions with Flynn about his calls with Kislyak, the Post said.
However, court papers filed in connection with Flynn's guilty plea indicated that an unidentified Trump transition team member participated in strategising on Flynn's calls. People familiar with the issue identified the official as McFarland, the newspaper said.
After the papers were filed, investigators again questioned McFarland and she revised her original denial that sanctions arose in her discussions with Flynn, it said.
""She walked back her previous denial that sanctions were discussed, saying a general statement Flynn had made to her that things were going to be OK could have been a reference to sanctions,"" the Post reported.

She and Giuffra convinced FBI agents that she did not intentionally mislead them, the newspaper said.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Pirates kidnapped 12 crew members from a Swiss merchant vessel on Saturday in Nigerian waters, the ship's operator said in a statement.
Kidnapping for ransom is a common problem in parts of Nigeria. A number of foreigners have been kidnapped in the last few years in the southern Niger Delta region, source of most of the crude oil which is the mainstay of west Africa's biggest economy.
Massoel Shipping, operator of MV Glarus, said the vessel carrying wheat was traveling between the southwestern commercial capital Lagos and southern Niger Delta oil hub Port Harcourt when it was boarded by pirates, who took 12 away of the 19 crew members.
It said the attack happened around 45 nautical miles south west of Bonny Island.
""The company is working with the authorities and specialists to secure the speedy and safe release of those being held,"" Massoel Shipping said in its statement. The statement did not give the nationalities of the crew members.
Switzerland's foreign ministry said it had learned from the company that none of the crew members were from Switzerland itself.
Nigeria's navy and maritime police said they were unaware of the kidnapping and would investigate.

SHANGHAI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China's foreign ministry on Saturday summoned the U.S. ambassador in Beijing to protest Washington's decision to sanction a Chinese military agency and its director for purchasing Russian fighter jets and an advanced surface-to-air missile system.
Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang summoned Ambassador Terry Branstad to lodge ""stern representations"" and protest the sanctions, the foreign ministry said.
Earlier, Chinese defense ministry spokesman Wu Qian said China's decision to buy fighter jets and missile systems from Russia was a normal act of cooperation between sovereign countries, and the United States had ""no right to interfere"".
On Thursday, the U.S. State Department imposed sanctions on China's Equipment Development Department (EED), the branch of the military responsible for weapons procurement, after it engaged in ""significant transactions"" with Rosoboronexport, Russia's main arms exporter.
The sanctions are related to China's purchase of 10 SU-35 combat aircraft in 2017 and S-400 surface-to-air missile system-related equipment in 2018, the State Department said. 
A senior U.S. State Department official on Saturday said China was the only country that had taken possession of the advanced S-400 surface-to-air missile system, in a breach of a U.S. sanctions law imposed in response to Russia's ""malign behavior"".
The official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, insisted that the sanctions were aimed at Moscow, not Beijing.
The so-called Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA, was signed into law in 2017 to punish Russia for meddling in U.S. elections, aggression in Ukraine and involvement in Syria’s civil war.
""China is the first country in the world to use both of those systems,"" the official said. ""Both of those systems are extremely sophisticated and very high value.""
The mobile S-400 batteries, which include radars, a control system, and missiles with a range of up to 250 miles (402.34 km), was first deployed in Russia in 2007 and is considered Moscow's most effective defense against aircraft, missiles and drones. 
Russia has deployed S-400s in Syria, according to official Russian news media, and U.S. officials have been discussing the interest other nations, particularly NATO ally Turkey, have expressed in buying the system.
Washington has expressed concern that Turkey’s planned deployment of S-400s could threaten some U.S.-made weapons and other technology used by Turkey, including the F-35 fighter jet.
The official said the move against the Chinese agency was not discretionary, but was made because Beijing broke U.S. law. ""We hope it will be paid attention to because ... our goal is to prevent these types of transactions,"" he added.
The U.S. sanctions will block the EED and its director, Li Shangfu, from applying for export licenses and participating in the U.S. financial system.
""The U.S. approach is a blatant violation of the basic norms of international relations, a full manifestation of hegemony, and a serious breach of the relations between the two countries and their two militaries,"" Wu said in a notice posted on the Chinese defense ministry's official Wechat account.
He warned that the United States would face ""consequences"" if it did not immediately revoke the sanctions.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The fate of Chancellor Angela Merkel's unwieldy six-month-old government hangs in the balance this weekend as the three coalition parties seek again to resolve their dispute over Germany's scandal-tainted spymaster.
The coalition parties agreed on Tuesday to transfer spy chief Hans-Georg Maassen to the interior ministry following accusations that he harbored far-right views after he questioned the authenticity of video footage showing radicals hounding migrants in the eastern city of Chemnitz.
But the compromise deal, which would put Maassen in a better paid job, unraveled on Friday when Andrea Nahles - leader of the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), junior partner in Merkel's conservative-led coalition - said it was a mistake.
Merkel and her Bavarian ally Horst Seehofer agreed to review the deal and the chancellor said the three party leaders wanted to find a sustainable solution this weekend.
A source from one of the parties told Reuters no meeting was planned for Saturday.
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, general secretary of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), wrote to party members to say the CDU thought the planned talks should be used ""to clarify whether all coalition partners can continue to unite together behind the common mission"". 
She said there must no longer be any doubt about whether the governing parties were able and willing to tackle the issues that mattered to people.
Former SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel told magazine Der Spiegel: ""If the grand coalition doesn't manage to do what the people expect of it - namely stability and an ability to act - it has lost its raison d'etre.""
But the SPD's Olaf Scholz, who is Germany's vice chancellor and also its finance minister, suggested he wanted to keep the coalition together until 2021 despite recent quarrels.
""The government is elected for the entire legislative period,"" he told the daily Tagesspiegel in an interview, adding however that these would not be easy years for the coalition.
UNDERMINING TRUST
Kevin Kuehnert, who leads the SPD's youth wing and campaigned against the formation of the 'grand coalition', told newspaper Die Welt that the deal was incomprehensible for many Germans and was undermining trust.
""The coalition should not be maintained at any price,"" he said, adding he did not see it lasting until 2021. 
Nahles had been widely criticized by SPD members for agreeing to the deal, with some calling for the party to quit the coalition. Some members praised her on Saturday for admitting the mistake and seeking to correct it.
Polls published this week showed 72 percent of voters had less confidence in the government and almost half of Germans were in favor of a new election, reflecting discontent with the handling of the Maassen affair. 
Support for Merkel's conservative bloc - made up of her CDU and Seehofer's Christian Social Union (CSU) - slumped to a new low of 28 percent, a poll showed on Friday, while the far-right Alternative for Germany - which backed Maassen - hit a record high of 18 percent, ahead of the SPD on 17 percent. 

The 'grand coalition' only took office in March, almost six months after an election, due to the lack of other viable governing options. It got off to a bumpy start, with Merkel only managing two months ago to end a painful row with the CSU over immigration.

PiS, an economically left-leaning party with a conservative social agenda, swept into power in 2015 on a promise of massive welfare spending, more traditional values in public life and a boost in support for less-privileged Poles.
But trade unions are demanding more state money, particularly for salaries in the public sector, including education and healthcare, as the economy powers ahead at a rate that's among the highest in Europe.
Poland's gross domestic product has expanded by four to five percent on an annual basis each quarter since the beginning of last year, propelled largely by domestic consumption. 
But economists warn that Poland may begin to suffer from weaker economic sentiment prevailing across Europe, wage pressures and labor shortages in the coming years. And the PiS has stopped making promises on large-scale welfare spending.
""We can't live pay cheque to pay cheque ... Our families are starving,"" Jan Guz, head of the OPZZ trade union told protesters. OPZZ, which organized the march, has some 500,000 members across the country.
Another trade union, NSZZ Solidarnosc, a bedrock supporter of the PiS in past elections with nearly 700,000 members, last month called for a 12 percent pay rise to make up for inflation since public sector wages were last indexed in 2010.
Public support for PiS has held above 30 percent since the 2015 parliamentary election. Aside from the municipal election in four weeks, Poles will vote in a European Parliament ballot next May and in a parliamentary election in late 2019. 
Warsaw authorities said some 26,000 people took part in the protest.
Since coming to power, PiS has introduced cash stipends for families, raised salaries for young teachers, policemen and doctors, increased the minimum wage and lowered the retirement age in the country of 38 million.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Pope Francis said at the start of a four-day trip to the Baltics on Saturday that Lithuania should see its painful past under Soviet and Nazi domination as an impetus to promote tolerance in Europe.
Francis, on the first trip by a pope to the region since 1993, is using his visit to carry a message of solidarity for Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia as they look warily toward a newly aggressive Russia nearly 30 years after they broke away from the then-Soviet Union.
In his first speech, he warned Lithuanians to beware those ""sowing division and confrontation – often by exploiting insecurity or situations of conflict – and proclaiming that the only way possible to guarantee security and the continued existence of a culture is to try to eliminate, cancel or expel others.""
While he did not mention any countries, he appeared to be referring to populist governments in several European countries, including neighboring Poland, Hungary and Italy, all of which have made political gains with anti-immigrant stands.
""Throughout its history, Lithuania was able to shelter, receive and accept peoples of various ethnic groups and religions,"" Francis said in a speech to President Dalia Grybauskaite and the diplomatic corps.
He praised the country's ability to overcome ""totalitarian ideologies,"" a reference to the Nazi occupation during World War Two and Soviet domination from 1944 to 1991.
""You have suffered 'in the flesh' those efforts to impose a single model that would annul differences ....,"" he said, adding that Lithuanians could offer their experiences ""to the European Community in particular.""
Francis said Lithuania, which like the other two Baltic states is a member of the European Union and NATO, should use its history and geographic position to be ""a bridge between Eastern and Western Europe"".
On Sunday, the pope will visit the Museum of Occupations and Fights for Freedom, a former Soviet KGB prison in Vilnius where hundreds were murdered and thousands, including many priests, shipped off to Siberia.
The Catholic Church in Lithuania took a consistently anti-Soviet position during the annexation, and Grybauskaite thanked Francis for the Vatican's support when Lithuania was under Moscow's thumb.
The pope also will pray at a monument to the victims of the Vilnius ghetto, where only several hundred of its some 40,000 residents survived the Nazi extermination.
More than 200,000 Lithuanian Jews perished in the Holocaust and during the Soviet period a similar number of Lithuanians were sent to Siberia.

The pontiff will spend two days in predominantly Catholic Lithuania before moving on to Latvia and then Estonia.

They said it appeared to be the first time in almost a year that a group of refugees had tried to get to Europe by boat from Lebanon, where Syrian refugees account for roughly a quarter of the population.
Cyprus is around 180 km (110 miles) from the coast of northern Lebanon. Three more of the people on the boat were in a serious condition in hospital, the sources said.
The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR says there are close to 1 million registered Syrian refugees in Lebanon. The Lebanese government puts the number at 1.5 million.
As Syrian forces and their allies have retaken more territory in Syria, Lebanon’s president and other politicians have called for refugees to go back to areas where fighting is over before a deal is reached to end the civil war.
Some refugees have trickled back to Syria in recent months in what the Lebanese authorities have described as voluntary returns coordinated with the Syrian government. 
But U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said during a visit to Beirut last month that refugees were concerned about issues including the lack of infrastructure and fear of retribution and military conscription.
For larger numbers to decide to go back, he said, more confidence must be created by addressing these issues and UNHCR should have a presence in areas of return, according to a statement on UNHCR's website.

725,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2018 09:25AM ET</span>","Gunmen kill 25, including 12 Revolutionary Guards, in attack on Iran military parade","By Michael Georgy
DUBAI (Reuters) - Gunmen fired on a military parade in southwestern Iran on Saturday, killing 25 people, almost half of them members of the Revolutionary Guards, state news agencies reported, in one of the worst attacks ever on the elite force.State television said the assault, which wounded more than 60 people, targeted a stand where Iranian officials had gathered in the city of Ahvaz to watch an annual event marking the start of the Islamic Republic's 1980-88 war with Iraq.
An Iranian ethnic Arab opposition movement called the Ahvaz National Resistance, which seeks a separate state in oil-rich Khuzestan province, claimed responsibility for the attack. 
Islamic State militants also claimed responsibility. Neither claim provided evidence. All four attackers were killed. 
Women and children also died in the assault, state news IRNA agency reported. 
The bloodshed struck a blow to security in OPEC oil producer Iran, which has been relatively stable compared with neighboring Arab countries that have grappled with upheaval since the 2011 uprisings across the Middle East.
The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) have been the sword and shield of Shi'ite clerical rule in Iran since its 1979 Islamic Revolution. 
The Guards, the most powerful and heavily armed military force in the Islamic Republic, also play a big role in Iran's regional interests in countries such as Iraq, Syria and Yemen.
They answer to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and have a vast stake worth billions of dollars in the economy. 
A video distributed to Iranian media showed soldiers crawling as gunfire blazed towards them. One picked up a gun and scrambled to his feet as women and children fled for their lives.
WHERE DID THEY COME FROM?
A video on state television's website showed confused soldiers. Standing in front of the stand, one asked: ""Where did they come from?"" Another responded: ""From behind us.""
State television blamed ""takfiri elements"", a reference to Sunni Muslim militants, for the attack. Ahvaz is in the center of Khuzestan province, where there have been sporadic protests by minority Arabs in predominantly Shi'ite Iran.
An Iranian military spokesman said the gunmen were trained by two Gulf Arab states and had ties to the United States and Israel. He did not elaborate.
""These terrorists...were trained and organized by two... Gulf countries,"" Brigadier General Abolfazl Shekarchi told IRNA. ""They are not from Daesh (Islamic State) or other groups fighting (Iran's) Islamic system ... but they are linked to America and (Israel's intelligence agency) Mossad."" 
There was no immediate Gulf Arab comment on his remarks.
Iran has suggested that it could take military action in the Gulf to block other countries’ oil exports in retaliation for U.S. sanctions intended to halt its sales of crude.
Tensions between mainly Shi'ite Iran and mostly Sunni Saudi Arabia have risen in recent years, with the two countries supporting opposite sides in wars in Syria and Yemen and rival political parties in Iraq and Lebanon.
Saturday's attack came a day before President Hassan Rouhani heads to New York to address the U.N. General Assembly next week.
“Rouhani will use the terrorist attack to justify Iran’s presence in the Middle East...The attack will strengthen the IRGC’s position inside Iran and in the region,” Tehran-based political analyst Hamid Farahvashian said.
DOMINANT MILITARY FORCE
Iran will face pressure to respond to the high-profile attack on the Revolutionary Guards, the strategic force with the greatest commitment to the clerical leadership.
""The attacks are doubtlessly meant to tarnish the prestige of the IRGC, but I believe the terrorist incidents will strengthen the IRGC's standing and even mobilize some public support,"" said Ali Alfoneh, senior fellow at the Gulf Arab States Institute in Washington.
Hardliners like the IRGC have gained standing at the expense of pragmatists in Iran's multi-tiered leadership since president Donald Trump decided in May to pull the United States out of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Tehran and reimpose sanctions in moves to isolate the Islamic Republic.
Attacks on the military are rare in Iran.
Kurdish militants killed 10 Revolutionary Guards in an attack on an IRGC post on the Iraqi border in July, Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, the latest bloodshed in an area where armed Kurdish opposition groups are active. 

Last year, in the first deadly assault claimed by Islamic State in Tehran, 18 people were killed at the parliament and mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - The Vatican on Saturday signed a landmark agreement giving it a long-desired say in the appointment of bishops in China, though critics labeled the deal a sellout to the Communist government.
The provisional agreement, signed in Beijing by deputy foreign ministers from both sides, was announced as Pope Francis visited Lithuania on a four-day trip to the Baltic countries.
It gives the Holy See a decisive role in the appointment of all bishops in a country whose around 12 million Catholics have been split between an underground Church swearing loyalty to the Vatican and the state-supervised Catholic Patriotic Association.
The Vatican said the accord, a breakthrough after years of negotiations, was ""not political but pastoral.""
A Holy See statement did not mention Taiwan, which the Vatican recognizes diplomatically and which China sees as a renegade province.
However, diplomats have said the accord was a possible precursor to a resumption in diplomatic relations with Beijing after 70 years. Beijing does not allow countries to have diplomatic relations with both China and Taiwan.
Taiwan now has formal relations with only 17 states and the Vatican is the only one in Europe.
The Vatican said the pope hoped ""a new process may begin that will allow the wounds of the past to be overcome, leading to the full communion of all Chinese Catholics.""
But prospects of such an agreement had divided communities of Catholics across China, some of whom fear greater suppression should the Vatican cede more control to Beijing. Others want to see rapprochement and avoid a potential schism.
""They're giving the flock into the mouths of the wolves. It's an incredible betrayal,"" said Cardinal Joseph Zen, the feisty, 76-year-old former archbishop of Hong Kong who has led the opposition to the deal.
""The consequences will be tragic and long lasting, not only for the Church in China but for the whole Church because it damages the credibility. Maybe that's why they might keep the agreement secret,"" Zen told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. 
Vatican sources have said the deal will not be published and can be reviewed and fine-tuned in the future.
READMITTED
The Vatican said that as part of the deal, Pope Francis had recognized the legitimacy of the seven remaining state-appointed Chinese bishops who had been named without papal approval and had re-admitted them into the Church.
""Today, for the first time all the bishops in China are in communion with the Bishop of Rome (the pope),"" Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican Secretary of State and one of the chief architects of the deal, said in a statement.
Vatican sources have said that a few bishops appointed by Rome will cede their places to bishops who had been appointed by Beijing.

In future, new bishops first will be proposed by members of local Catholic communities together with Chinese authorities. The names of candidates will be sent to the Vatican and the pope will make a final decision, the sources said.

727,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2018 08:43AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Ecuador attempted to give Assange diplomat post in Russia - document,"By Alexandra Valencia
QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuador in 2017 gave Wikileaks founder Julian Assange a diplomatic post in Russia but rescinded it after Britain refused to give him diplomatic immunity, according to an Ecuadorean government document seen by Reuters. 
The aborted effort suggests Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno had engaged Moscow to resolve the situation of Assange, who has been holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy for six years to avoid arrest by British authorities on charges of skipping bail.
The incident was revealed in a letter by Ecuador's foreign ministry to a legislator who had asked for information about Ecuador's decision last year to grant Assange citizenship.
Ecuador last Dec. 19 approved a ""special designation in favor of Mr. Julian Assange so that he can carry out functions at the Ecuadorean Embassy in Russia,"" according to the letter written to opposition legislator Paola Vintimilla.
""Special designation"" refers to the Ecuadorean president's right to name political allies to a fixed number of diplomatic posts even if they are not career diplomats.
But Britain's Foreign Office in a Dec. 21 note said it did not accept Assange as a diplomat and that it did not ""consider that Mr. Assange enjoys any type of privileges and immunities under the Vienna Convention,"" reads the letter, citing a British diplomatic note.
Ecuador abandoned its decision shortly after, according to the letter. 
British authorities have said they will arrest Assange if he leaves the embassy, meaning he would have needed to be recognized as a diplomat in order to travel to Moscow.
Lawyers for Assange in the United States and Britain did not respond to requests for comment. WikiLeaks website did not respond to an email seeking comment. The Ecuadorean foreign ministry could not be reached for comment.
The plan to make Assange an Ecuadorean diplomat was made public last year, but the effort to send him to Moscow has not been previously reported. 
U.S. intelligence agencies in 2017 said they believed WikiLeaks was an intermediary used by Russia to publish emails hacked from top Democrats to embarrass 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
U.S. President Donald Trump faces an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russia to win that election. Assange denies receiving the emails from Russia, but has not ruled out having obtained them from a third party. Trump and Russia deny collusion. 
The Guardian newspaper on Friday reported that Russian diplomats held secret talks in London to help Assange flee Britain through an operation tentatively scheduled for Christmas Eve, 2017.
The story, which cited unidentified sources, said ""details of the plan were sketchy"" and that it was aborted because it was deemed too risky.
""The Embassy has never engaged either with Ecuadorian colleagues, or with anyone else, in discussions on any kind of Russia's participation in ending Mr Assange's stay within the diplomatic mission of Ecuador,"" Russia's embassy in London wrote on its web site in a response to The Guardian story.
It was not immediately evident if Ecuadorean officials had any contact with Russia as part of the Assange appointment. 
Reuters was unable to obtain comment from Russia's foreign ministry on Ecuador's plan to make him a diplomat there.
The letter from Ecuador's foreign ministry was a summary of 28 documents that were sent to Vintimilla in response to her request. 
Among those documents is a Dec. 4 letter from Assange in which he renounced his request for political asylum from Ecuador in preparation to become an Ecuadorean diplomat. The letter, which was seen by Reuters, said he ultimately planned to travel to Ecuador.
Vintimilla, who discussed some of the documents during a Thursday press conference, said Assange should lose his citizenship as a result of that letter. 
Assange sought asylum in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questions about allegations of sex crimes, accusations that were later dropped. 
Ecuador's president Moreno has said Assange's asylum cannot be eternal, but has also been reluctant to abruptly halt it on concerns that Assange's human rights could be at risk.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said on Saturday it would not capitulate in Brexit talks and again urged its EU partners to engage with its proposals, as ministers in Paris and Berlin suggested the next move in the negotiations should come from London.
British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday demanded new proposals and respect from European Union leaders, saying after a summit in Austria that talks had hit an impasse - a position her foreign minister reinforced on Saturday, even if that meant leaving the bloc next March without a deal.
""If the EU's view is that just by saying no to every proposal made by the United Kingdom, we will eventually capitulate and end up either with a Norway option or indeed staying in the EU... then they've profoundly misjudged he British people,"" Jeremy Hunt told BBC radio.
""We may be polite, but we have a bottom line. And so they need to engage with us now in seriousness.""
May's defiant statement was welcomed on Saturday by many in the British press that had seen the Salzburg summit as a failure for her. The Daily Express said it was ""May's finest hour"". 
DIGGING IN
But initial reactions from across the English Channel suggested France and Germany were digging in too.
EU leaders and May have said they want to get a deal agreed in October, to be finalised in November. 
In Paris, Minister for European Affairs Nathalie Loiseau said that, while France still believed a good Brexit deal was possible, it must also prepare for a 'no deal' outcome.
Britain's vote to leave ""cannot lead to the EU going bust,"" she said on France Info radio. ""...That's the message we have tried to send for several months now to our British counterparts, who may have thought we were going to say 'yes' to whatever deal they came up with.""
In Berlin, German Deputy Foreign Minister Michael Roth said the other 27 EU states were striving to achieve reasonable solutions. ""The blame game against the EU is therefore more than unfair. We can't solve the problems that are arising on the island (Britain) due to Brexit,"" he said on Twitter.
In London, the Telegraph reported that May faced the prospect of ministerial resignations next week if she failed to come up with an alternative to the ""Chequers"" Brexit plan that she presented in Austria.
After May's Friday statement, European Council President Donald Tusk said that the results of the EU's analysis of that plan had been known to Britain for many weeks. But Hunt said there was a difference between rhetoric and substance.
""On the substance of the Chequers proposals, we have not had a detailed response,"" he said, adding that EU proposals for the Irish border would mean that it was impossible ""to leave the EU intact as one country"".
May's Conservatives rely on a small pro-Brexit Northern Irish party, the Democratic Unionists (DUP), for their governing majority in parliament. 
Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the DUP should not have a veto on a ""backstop"" insurance policy to keep the Irish border fully open for trade.
May has accepted the need for a backstop but says the EU's version of the proposal would see Northern Ireland carved off from the United Kingdom. The EU says May's proposal, keeping the province and mainland Britain in the same regulatory space, undermines the single market.
Despite the differences, Coveney told RTE radio an Irish backstop was ""doable"" by an October summit.
BUMPY AND DIFFICULT
Hunt said Britain's economy would be able to withstand a no-deal Brexit, saying it was ""absolutely right"" that many Britons were now content to leave the EU without a deal.
Around 52 percent of Britons voted to leave the EU in a referendum in 2016 and 48 percent to stay.
""Even in a situation where we aren't able to come to an agreement, we would be trading on World Trade Organisation terms. It would be bumpy, it would be difficult, but we would find a way to survive and prosper as a country,"" Hunt said.
""We've had far bigger challenges in our history. But it's not our desired outcome.""
In Berlin, magazine Der Spiegel said Germany's government expected the impact of a no-deal Brexit on its labor market to be ""relatively small"". It cited a government response to a request for information from the far-left Linke party.

UKARA, Tanzania (Reuters) - Divers rescued a man on Saturday as they searched for survivors from the wreck of an overcrowded Tanzanian ferry that capsized on Lake Victoria on Thursday, killing at least 183 people.
Four navy divers resumed the search operation inside the sunken MV Nyerere early on Saturday after hearing sounds that suggested signs of life.
They pulled a man out of the overturned ship and he was rushed to hospital, a Reuters witness said. His condition was not immediately known.
Bodies continued to float to the surface around the vessel, which initial estimates suggested was carrying more than 300 people, and state broadcaster TBC said the death toll had reached 183.
Works, Transport and Communication Minister Isack Kamwelwe said the government was sending sophisticated equipment to aid the rescue effort.
""This equipment will increase efficiency in the rescue operation and we will continue with the search until we are satisfied that we have rescued everyone,"" he told Reuters.
Relatives of the deceased had started to identify the bodies of their loved ones, he said.
The ferry sank on Thursday evening just a few meters from the dock on Ukerewe, the lake's biggest island.

On Friday President John Magufuli ordered the arrest of those responsible for the sinking.

731,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2018 06:31AM ET</span>",Ordering opioids online? Mail carrier may also deliver handcuffs,"By Jonathan Allen
NEW YORK (Reuters) - He looked like a regular mail carrier, dropping off an unremarkable package at an upscale New York City apartment tower, but neither the man nor the package were quite what they seemed.
The mail carrier was really a federal agent, conducting a so-called controlled delivery, a tactic the U.S. government employs to help stem the flow of heroin, prescription painkillers and other opioids fueling the nation's epidemic of fatal overdoses. 
Drug-filled packages with misleading labels have become a common sight at John F. Kennedy International Airport's (JFK) sprawling mail-sorting hangars, a front line in the battle against opioids. Many of the parcels originate in China, having been ordered on the web's darker corners. 
""Nobody anticipated the explosion we were going to face,"" said Christopher Lau, who oversees the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations office (HSI) at the airport.
Fatal opioid overdoses jumped to a record high of nearly 50,000 last year, more than double the 2013 toll, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Customs agents with X-ray machines and sniffer dogs detect and seize what they can. But to track, arrest and prosecute suspected dealers, the New York HSI office organizes several controlled deliveries each month, taking the packages out to see who claims them.
For this delivery, a Reuters reporter was allowed to ride along and watch the agents in action. 
The package had arrived on a Friday in August, mailed from Shanghai and filled with 250 grams of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 100 times stronger than morphine that can kill with a 2-milligram dose. It was enough to cut into hundreds of thousands of bootleg painkiller pills, which could sell for $10 each or more. It is also often added to heroin, contributing to a rise of overdoses by unsuspecting users. 
The package was an ideal candidate for a controlled delivery, Lau said. It was addressed to someone called Randy, but there was no record of anyone with that name living at the designated address. And there had been a pattern of earlier packages delivered to the building from China, often addressed to non-existent apartments or apparently fictional residents.
    Before the delivery, agents replaced the fentanyl powder with coffee grounds.
More than a dozen federal agents set up surveillance around the building, snacking in unmarked cars or pretending to read a newspaper on a nearby bench, all dressed in blue jeans and sports jerseys. They watched the building's glass-fronted lobby, waiting to see who claimed the package. 
ONLINE SHOPPING
The volume of drugs coming through the mail has grown in step with legitimate online shopping, customs agents say, as Americans have taken to ordering drugs from overseas via the dark web. Agents suspect that was how the package for ""Randy"" came to arrive at JFK.
It is illegal to import prescription medicines and controlled substances from outside the United States.
Chinese laboratories have become the main source of fentanyl in the United States, most of it sent through the mail, the U.S. Department of Justice says.
    In 2016, customs agents caught nine packages at JFK containing fentanyl, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). So far this year, they have seized more than 200, in part because of expanded screening and better training, said Anthony Bucci, a CBP spokesman.
Outside the New York apartment building, two eventless hours passed before a man emerged carrying a plastic bag. An agent discreetly tailed him. A false alarm. 
    Then the voice of Walter Rivera, an HSI special agent, came over the radio with a new urgency: ""You see the guy who came out with a backpack right here? Gray shirt and ponytail?"" 
    Agents had hidden a GPS tracking device in the package. The man with a ponytail fiddled on his phone and then got into a livery cab. ""If the GPS goes down the block, that's him,"" Rivera radioed.    
Lau watched the GPS move and bellowed, ""It's him!"" 
The agents tore off in their cars, sirens wailing. The confused cab driver soon pulled over by a busy sidewalk, and agents handcuffed his passenger, taking back the package.
He turned out to be the building's concierge, who had taken the package with him at the end of his shift. He quickly confessed that his name was not Randy.
Although agents were able to make an arrest in this case, more than a million international packages arrive each day in the country, and authorities can only screen a fraction of them. No one knows how many packages of drugs slip through the net.

European Commissioner Johannes Hahn, who has been liaising with the Swiss foreign minister, told the Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper that time was running out to clinch an accord that Brussels has been seeking for a decade.
""In the interest of both sides we have to get results soon. Negotiations cannot become a never-ending story,"" Hahn said. ""I expect that by the end of October at the latest we see clearly whether we can put something together or not."" 
The Commission last year agreed to recognize Swiss bourse trading rules only until the end of 2018, linking any extension to progress on a treaty with non-EU member Switzerland.
Asked what would happen to stock trading if no treaty deal emerged by the end of October, Hahn said: ""I honestly cannot imagine...that we would extend the exception by another year.""
Trading volume on Swiss stock exchanges could plunge by 70 to 80 percent should the EU refuse to recognize Swiss exchange rules as equivalent to EU norms, prompting the Swiss government in June to draw up contingency plans that could ban trading of Swiss shares on EU bourses in a retaliatory move.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker last week also urged Bern to wrap up negotiations quickly, saying time was short as attention turns to the crunch phase of Brexit talks.
The Swiss government has been wrestling with its approach toward treaty talks, which have run aground because of opposition from both the anti-EU far right and the usually pro-Europe center left.
The left is refusing to budge on safeguards to protect Swiss wages and working conditions, while the far right opposes any deal that would impinge on Swiss sovereignty. The four-party cabinet is due to decide its strategy on Friday .
Unlike Britain in its messy divorce from the EU, Switzerland has a patchwork of around 120 sectoral accords that govern ties with its most important trading partner and that will remain in effect even if treaty talks fail.
But Brussels has been pushing for a treaty that would sit atop those accords and have the Swiss routinely adopt changes to single market rules. It would also provide a more effective platform to resolve disputes.

Failure to strike a deal would means no increase in Swiss access to the single market, dashing hopes for a new electricity union. It could also endanger unfettered EU market access for Swiss makers of products such as medical devices.

""If the EU's view is that just by saying no to every proposal made by the United Kingdom, we will eventually capitulate and end up either with a Norway option or indeed staying in the EU, if that is there view then they've profoundly misjudged he British people,"" Hunt told BBC radio.

""We may be polite, but we have a bottom line. And so they need to engage with us now in seriousness.""

The pontiff will spend two days in predominantly Catholic Lithuania before moving on to Latvia and then Estonia.
He was greeted at Vilnius airport by Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, a military brass band and a group of children waving Vatican flags and singing songs.
He then left for the presidential palace in central Vilnius to make his first address.
The trip is the first by a pope to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia since 1993. A quarter of a century later, the countries are members of NATO and the euro zone but the past still looms large in a region subject in turn to Soviet and Nazi oppression and where religious persecution left a traumatic legacy.
In Lithuania, Francis will visit the Vilnius Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights, a former Soviet KGB prison where hundreds were murdered and thousands shipped off to Siberia, including many priests.
He will also pray at a monument to the victims of the Vilnius ghetto, in a country where only several hundred of over 200,000 Jews survived the Holocaust.

British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday that Brexit talks with the EU had hit an impasse, defiantly challenging the bloc to come up with its own plans a day after EU leaders savaged her proposals.
""The British people decided to leave in a (2016) referendum, we respect that. But this choice cannot lead to the EU going bust, unravelling,"" Nathalie Loiseau, minister for European affairs, told France Info radio.

Loiseau said May's so-called Chequers proposals, whereby British goods would enter the EU's single market freely, were ""too negative"" and would have led to ""unfair competition for European companies"".
She said she still believed a good deal with Britain was possible, but that France should get ready for the possibility of a ""no deal"" and would introduce legislation in November to that effect.
""We are working on reaching a good deal, that's where we spend most of our energy. It's still possible, I believe it is, all the 27 (EU member states) believe it is. But I can't rule out that we don't reach an agreement in the end.""
""Let's imagine we don't reach an agreement. What we say is we must prepare for that,"" she added.

May has said her proposals for future trade with the EU were the only way forward. EU leaders in Salzburg repeated their view that the plans would undermine their cherished single market.

737,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 22, 2018 03:41AM ET</span>",India's Modi faces calls for resignation over French jet deal,"By Sanjeev Miglani and Ingrid Melander
NEW DELHI/PARIS (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi faced calls for his resignation over allegations of corruption in a military jet deal with France after former French president Francois Hollande was quoted as saying New Delhi had influenced the choice of a local partner.
Indian political parties have been gunning for Modi over the 2016 purchase of 36 Rafale planes from Dassault Aviation estimated to be worth $8.7 billion, saying he had overpaid for the planes and had not been transparent. 
In recent months, the opposition has questioned the government on the choice of billionaire Indian businessman Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence as Dassault's local partner instead of a state-run manufacturer with decades of experience.
On Friday, Hollande, who cleared the intergovernmental deal when he was in office, was quoted as saying New Delhi had put pressure on Dassault to choose Reliance. 
""We had no choice. We took the interlocutor that was given to us,"" he was reported as telling the French news service Mediapart, fuelling a political storm in India.
Under Indian defense procurement rules, a foreign firm must invest at least 30 percent of the contract in India to help it build up its manufacturing base and wean off imports. 
For that, the French firm picked Reliance and not Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, the state-run giant that has been producing planes for decades, most of them Russian under license. 
""The PM personally negotiated and changed the Rafale deal behind closed doors. Thanks to François Hollande, we now know he personally delivered a deal worth billions of dollars to ...Anil Ambani,"" Rahul Gandhi, the president of the main opposition Congress party, said in a tweet. ""The PM has betrayed India.""
Modi, who stormed to power in 2014 promising to rid India of deep-seated corruption, had no ""moral right"" to remain in power after the revelations from Hollande, senior Congress leader Anand Sharma said. 
Smaller parties also joined the attack on Modi who is already under pressure to shore up his political base ahead of a series of state elections this year followed by a national election in 2019.
Modi's office did not respond to a request for comment. The defense ministry said in a tweet that neither the French nor Indian government had a say in the matter.
""The report referring to former French president Mr. Hollande's statement that GoI (government of India) insisted upon a particular firm as offset partner for the Dassault Aviation in Rafale is being verified.
""It is reiterated that neither GoI nor French Govt had any say in the commercial decision.""
Reliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Dassault denied the report, saying it had picked Reliance as a partner for industrial reasons.
""This is Dassault Aviation's choice, as (Dassault) CEO Eric Trappier explained in an interview published in MINT newspaper on April 17,"" the company, which also makes Falcon business planes, said in a statement.
""Dassault Aviation and Reliance have built a plant in Nagpur for manufacturing parts for Falcon and Rafale aircraft. The Nagpur site was chosen because of the availability of land with direct access to an airport runway, an essential condition (for) aeronautic activities.""
The French foreign ministry published a statement saying French authorities were not involved in the choice of Indian industrial partners involved in the Rafale deal.
""The French government is in no way involved in the choice of the Indian industrial partners which have been, are or will be, chosen by French companies,"" the statement said.
""In accordance with the Indian procedure, French companies have full freedom to choose the Indian industrial partners they consider to be most pertinent and then to propose to the Indian government for approval the offset projects they want to carry out in India with local partners to respect their obligations,"" it added.
The deal with Dassault was expected to deepen strategic ties with France and the company itself has hoped it would lead to a larger order for combat jets that the Indian air force says it needs to face a perceived twin threat from China and Pakistan.

India picked the Rafale plane to replace its ageing fleet of Russian aircraft from a field that included Lockheed Martin's F-16, Saab's Gripen, the Eurofighter Typhoon, Boeing's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the Russian MiG-35.

DALLAS (Reuters) - Ted Cruz is in the political fight of his life — and he knows it. 
The conservative U.S. senator from Texas is being outpaced and overshadowed by his progressive challenger, Beto O’Rourke, who is pushing to be the first Democrat in Texas to be elected to the Senate in 30 years. 
Cruz and O’Rourke faced off in their first debate ahead of Nov. 6’s congressional elections at Southern Methodist University in Dallas on Friday, and Cruz’s strategy swiftly became clear: Paint O’Rourke as too radical for this traditionally Republican state. 
O’Rourke, a charismatic congressman from El Paso, has benefited from an avalanche of media attention and a gusher of small donations, raising millions of dollars more than Cruz. 
Cruz remains favored, but only slightly. Most polls indicate the election is now too close to confidently predict.
The race has massive implications for the battle for the U.S. Senate. Democrats need two more seats to gain control and upend President Donald Trump’s agenda. Cruz’s seat was supposed to be safe, but he conceded at Friday’s debate that he’s in a battle.
DEFINING A PARTY 
Cruz’s strategy in the debate highlighted how O’Rourke’s star-making candidacy can be been a double-edged sword for Democrats. 
With his support of universal healthcare, his openness to abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, and his willingness to consider impeaching Trump, O’Rourke may define the party going forward in a way that could be incongruent with more moderate Democrats who must defend their Senate seats in states that Trump won in 2016.
At the same time, his campaign has kept the spotlight and money away from other races that are critical to Democrats’ hopes of taking the Senate in states such as Nevada and Tennessee.
Ultimately, even if O’Rourke pulls off what might be considered a political miracle in Texas, it might not matter for Democrats unless they can hold on to Senate seats in places such as Florida, Missouri, and Montana as well. 
As for Cruz, his campaign continues to worry about competing with O’Rourke financially and whether Republican voters will turn out in numbers to ensure his victory. He is turning to the White House for help. Trump is expected to appear at a rally in Texas with Cruz next month.
The two candidates will face off twice more in debates before Election Day. 
CONTENTIOUS DEBATE 
In the debate, the two candidates clashed over issues such as immigration, gun rights, trade, and protests of the National Anthem, with O’Rourke frequently complaining that Cruz was misrepresenting his positions. At one point he accused Cruz of “slander.”
Cruz drew O’Rourke’s ire when he suggested that O’Rourke, in supporting protests of police brutality by National Football League players, favored burning the American flag.
O’Rourke said Cruz was trying “to mislead” the public. “No one here, including myself, has suggested anyone should be doing that,” he said. 
He also pushed back at Cruz’s suggestion that he supports doing away with the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which safeguards gun rights. “That’s not true,” O’Rourke said. 
After the debate, O’Rourke said Cruz “has a tendency to mischaracterize a position.”
“If we are talking about NFL players who are kneeling during the National Anthem at a football game to call attention to injustice in this country, he’ll talk about flag-burning,” O'Rourke said. 
Cruz’s camp responded by arguing that O’Rourke’s positions were finally being publicized. “It’s the first time he is being directly confronted with his policies,” said campaign spokeswoman Emily Miller. 
In his closing statement at the debate, Cruz lumped O’Rourke in with New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an avowed socialist, and argued that he was to the left of progressive U.S. senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. 
After the debate, O’Rourke was asked whether Texas is “really ready for a vision that sounds socialist.”
“I don’t buy into the labels,” he replied. 

Even if O’Rourke doesn’t, Cruz showed on Friday that he certainly does.

Tensions have ramped up between Iran and the United States after Trump withdrew from a landmark multilateral nuclear deal in May and reimposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic last month.
As Rouhani spoke, Iran began displaying its naval power in the Gulf during annual parades in the capital Tehran and the port of Bandar Abbas on the Gulf marking the start of the country’s 1980-88 war with Iraq.
Iran has suggested in recent weeks that it could take military action in the Gulf to block other countries’ oil exports in retaliation for U.S. sanctions intended to halt its sales of crude. 
Washington maintains a fleet in the Gulf that protects oil shipping routes.
""The same will happen to Trump. America will suffer the same fate as Saddam Hussein,"" Rouhani said in a speech carried live by state television. 
""Iran will not abandon its defensive weapons ... including its missiles that make America so angry,"" Rouhani said. 
State media said about 600 vessels took part in the Gulf naval drill on Saturday, a day after Iran held aerial exercises in the waterway, vowing that a ""pounding reply"" awaited the country's enemies.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The family of an Australian filmmaker pardoned by Cambodia after being jailed on espionage charges said on Saturday it was happy the ""nightmare"" came to an end, while the Australian foreign minister thanked the government in Phnom Penh for his release.
James Ricketson, 69, was freed from Phnom Penh's Prey Sar prison on Friday after a court sentenced him in August to six years in jail for damaging the country's reputation. 
He was arrested in June 2017 after being photographed flying a drone above a rally organized by the now-dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) before communal elections.
""We are just so relieved and excited about this news,"" Ricketson's son, Jesse, told Reuters in an e-mailed statement. 
""It still hasn't really sunk in. It has been a really tough 16 months and I'm just kind of in shock right now. We would like to offer our hugest gratitude to King Norodom Sihamoni for showing us compassion and bringing this nightmare to an end.""
Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne also thanked her Cambodian counterpart for the release. ""This ends a distressing time for Mr. Ricketson and his family,"" Payne said in an e-mailed statement. 
Jesse Ricketson said the family has been concerned about his father's health as he approaches 70.
""We're not sure how long he could have continued to endure the conditions of the notorious Prey Sar prison,"" he said.
He added the family expected Ricketson in Australia ""very soon"", probably on Sunday. 
The filmmaker has been visiting Cambodia for more than 20 years, producing documentaries about the country and its people.
His arrest came amid a wider crackdown on freedom of expression by Hun Sen's government and his Cambodian People's Party (CPP). The CPP in July claimed victory following a controversial general election which was largely unopposed.
Rights groups said the July 29 vote was neither free nor fair given the absence of a significant challenger to Hun Sen, who has ruled for 33 years.

Payne said on Saturday that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would continue to provide Ricketson with consular assistance, but due to ""privacy considerations"" would not make any further statements on his release.

Bo, once a rising star tipped for a national leadership role, served as governor of the rustbelt industrial province of Liaoning from 2001 to 2004. 
He was Communist Party chief of the southwestern municipality of Chongqing before being ousted in a scandal involving the murder of a British businessman by Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, in 2012. 
An editorial posted on the official website of the Liaoning government (http://www.ln.gov.cn) on Friday said the ""political ecology"" of the province had been severely damaged by both Bo and Wang Min, who was Liaoning Party Secretary until 2015 and was imprisoned on bribery offences in 2017. 
The editorial, originally published by the official Liaoning Daily, said the local party had recently devised new rules to ""remove the source of political pollution"". 
Party supervision committees at all levels are now carrying out comprehensive inspections and rectifications to ensure that the adverse effects of Bo and Wang are fully eliminated, the editorial said. 
The province needed to work to ensure that the decisions of President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party central committee ""take root and blossom"", it said. 
Bo was originally seen as a major rival to Xi, who has used a wide-ranging campaign against corruption and ill-discipline among Communist Party officials and local governments to consolidate his power. 
Last year in July, Chen Miner, who had just been appointed the leader of Chongqing, said the city must banish the ""evil legacy"" of its former head Bo.

SANTO DOMINGO (Reuters) - China's most senior envoy inaugurated a new embassy in the Dominican Republic on Friday after the Caribbean country cut ties with Taiwan in a move that prompted U.S. concern over the Asian island's dwindling number of allies. 
Self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own, now has formal relations with only 17 countries, almost all of them small and less developed nations in Central America and the Pacific, including Belize and Nauru.
""We have witnessed a historic breakthrough,"" capping 20 years of growing engagement, Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi, the government's top diplomat, said in an speech televised by Chinese state media.
Along with the Dominican Republic's decision in May, Panama and El Salvador have also switched recognition to Beijing in the past two years. 
The United States recalled its top diplomats in those countries and warned that China was offering economic incentives in a bid for domination. 
Tensions between the United States and countries in the region have flared over U.S. President Donald Trump's hard line policies against immigration.
U.S. Ambassador Robin Bernstein said on Thursday, in her first public appearance back in the Dominican Republic, that she had been asked about China's role in the region while in Washington, and that she hoped countries were considering their ""long-term goals"".
In a statement on Thursday, the U.S. embassy in El Salvador lamented that countries in the region were deepening ties to ""unfamiliar partners"" and engaging in transactions that ""lack transparency"". 
Taiwan says China offered the Dominican Republic a $3.1 billion package of investments and loans to get them to sever ties, though China said there were no economic pre-conditions. 
Wang said the Dominican Republic is China's biggest trade partner in the Caribbean, setting the foundation for diplomatic ties.
""The Chinese developing economy and expanding market have brought real benefits to the Dominican Republic,"" he said.
Wang, in a swipe at U.S. criticism, said that as a sovereign country, the Dominican Republic had the absolute right to decide its own foreign policy and that no other nation had the right to interfere. 
""The Dominican Republic establishing diplomatic relations with China does not target any third party, does not affect each other's foreign policy, and will not harm the traditional influence and legitimate rights of other countries in the region,"" he added.

Wang will also visit Guyana and Suriname before speaking at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.

As he was leaving his home in the city of Yajalon on Friday afternoon, Mario Gomez was confronted by two suspects and shot in the abdomen, according to El Heraldo de Chiapas, the local newspaper that employed him. Gomez was taken to a hospital, where he died of his injuries. The suspects fled the scene. 
""We vigorously condemn the cowardly aggression suffered by our colleague,"" the paper wrote in an editorial note. ""We demand of the competent authorities the investigation of these criminal acts.""

""The prosecutor's office of Chiapas, conscious of the importance of a free press, reiterates its commitment to exhaust all lines of investigation possible to solve this reprehensible crime and bring those responsible to justice,"" the office said in a statement.
Mexico has seen unprecedented levels of violence as rival drug gangs splintered into smaller groups after more than a decade of a military-led campaign to battle the cartels.
Journalists, in particular, have become a target for violence in Mexico, which the Committee to Protect Journalists classifies as the most dangerous country in the Western Hemisphere for media workers.

""We're determined to ensure that the Venezuelan people get their say.""
He did not give further details on the nature of the planned actions.
Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Trump administration has steadily increased sanctions against officials in the leftist government of President Nicolas Maduro, accusing it of stifling democracy by jailing opposition leaders.
Last year, Washington imposed sanctions prohibiting trading new debt and equity issued by the Venezuelan government and its state oil company PDVSA. It has imposed several rounds of sanctions on government officials, including on Maduro.
Venezuela's economy has collapsed under Maduro, with annual inflation running at 200,000 percent, and staple foods and basic medicine increasingly difficult to obtain, which has led to mass emigration. 
Pompeo's warning comes ahead of the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York next week attended by heads of state from around the world. Maduro has not attended the meetings since 2015 and this week said he may not attend the gathering because of concerns about his safety.

In August, two drones exploded over an outdoor rally in Caracas where Maduro was giving a speech, injuring seven soldiers and leading to the arrest of over a dozen suspects, including several military officials. Maduro described it as an assassination attempt.

RALEIGH (Reuters) - Residents of Georgetown County, South Carolina, where five rivers flow into the ocean, were preparing on Friday for a deluge of water in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, which has killed at least 40 people.
The county of 60,000 people, on the Atlantic coast between Myrtle Beach and Charleston, is one of several areas in the Carolinas waiting anxiously as rivers start to crest, a week after Florence dumped some three feet of rain on the region. 
Flooding could begin early next week, officials said during a community meeting on Thursday, as water continues to drain into rivers and reservoirs across North and South Carolina.
The city of Georgetown on Friday was handing out 15,000 sandbags as the county developed plans to evacuate residents. 
""Please heed the warnings,"" Sheriff Lane Cribb said. ""Protecting lives and property will be our goal ... You better pray."" 
Thirty-one deaths have been attributed to the storm in North Carolina, eight in South Carolina and one in Virginia. 
More than three dozen flood gauges in North and South Carolina showed flooding, according to the National Weather Service. 
In Bladen County, North Carolina, around 100 people and 33 animals were rescued ""in a dangerous operation in the middle of the night"" after a dam burst, Governor Roy Cooper said in a twitter post on Friday. Blackhawk helicopters were used to pluck many of them to safety.
Some 4,700 people across North Carolina have been rescued by boat or helicopter since the storm made landfall, twice as many as in Hurricane Matthew two years ago, according to state officials. About 10,000 remained in shelters.
The coastal city of Wilmington, North Carolina, remained mostly cut off by floodwaters on Friday, 
Some 650 roads remained closed, the state's department of transportation said, warning motorists not to travel in 17 southeastern counties worst-hit by Florence. 
More than 54,000 homes and businesses were without power in the Carolinas on Friday afternoon.
One week after Florence made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, North Carolina was still feeling its effects, Cooper said. ""Some locations won't see rivers crest until this weekend and flooding won't subside until next week,"" he said in another twitter post. 
As floodwaters continued to rise, concerns grew about environmental and health dangers. 
 Duke Energy  Corp (N:DUK) said on Friday that breaches in a cooling lake dam forced it to shut down its natural gas-fired L.V. Sutton plant in North Carolina. The utility said it could not rule out the possibility that coal ash from a dump adjacent to the plant, which formerly burned coal, might be flowing into the nearby Cape Fear River.
Coal ash can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife.
The flooding from Florence has also caused 21 hog ""lagoons,"" which store manure from pig farms, to overflow in North Carolina, possibly contaminating standing water, according to the state's Department of Environmental Quality. North Carolina is one of the leading hog-producing states in the country.

Several sewer systems in the region also have released untreated or partly treated sewage and storm water into waterways over the last week, local media reported.

Ministers will demand an alternative plan to her ""Chequers"" proposal at a Cabinet meeting on Monday, the Telegraph said.
That plan had already been savaged by European Union leaders in Salzburg earlier in the week, prompting May to defiantly challenge leaders of the bloc to come up with its own plans.
Pro-Brexit members of May's party on Friday had welcomed her defiant tone, but her Chequers proposal has many domestic critics, too.
The Telegraph said there was ""speculation"" that work and pensions minister Esther McVey might walk out of Monday's meeting if no new proposal was presented, while international development minister Penny Mordaunt was also tipped as a possible resignation candidate, though the newspaper said friends denied she would resign.
Earlier on Friday, Mordaunt said that the EU's attitude was increasing support within Britain for an exit from the bloc, even if it meant leaving without a deal.

The Telegraph said Sajid Javid, the interior minister, favored a deal that would make it easier for Britain to sign trade deals, but was unlikely to quit.

A past conviction in a vote-rigging case earned him a suspended jail term which prevented him from being prime minister. And he is due next month to launch an appeal against a three and a half year prison sentence passed in a separate abuse of office case.
He is also under investigation in a third case on suspicion of forming a criminal group to siphon off cash from state projects, some of them EU-funded. 
But he emerged unscathed from an eight-hour meeting of the party's executive committee on Friday at which he won a comfortable majority of support, beating off critics who wanted him out.
Analysts said his latest confrontation with internal party critics might also complicate Dragnea's and his allies' efforts to stall the fight against corruption in one of the European Union's most graft-prone states.
Dragnea led the party to a sweeping victory in a Dec. 2016 parliamentary election, but since then its attempts to weaken the judiciary have dominated the public agenda.
An attempt to decriminalize several corruption offences last year via emergency decrees triggered massive protests and was ultimately withdrawn. Changes to criminal codes this year invited comparisons with Poland and Hungary, which are embroiled in a standoff with Brussels over the rule of law.
Deputy Prime Minister Paul Stanescu, Bucharest mayor Gabriela Firea and lawmaker Adrian Tutuianu - all vice-presidents of the party - called for his resignation, saying his management has hurt the party's popularity.
Dragnea has previously argued in favor of an emergency decree that would grant amnesty for some corruption offenses - potentially affording him protection against prosecution - or retroactively scrap wiretap evidence collected by Romania's intelligence service SRI on behalf of prosecutors. 
After Friday's executive meeting, Dragnea said Prime Minister Viorica Dancila, a close ally, had not supported the idea of an emergency decree on amnesty at this time.
But Dragnea vowed to continue fighting against what he calls a ""parallel state"" of prosecutors and secret services who want to bring the party down via corruption trials.
""I personally no longer care an emergency decree regarding amnesty,"" Dragnea said. ""If the government wants to pass it, it's up to them, whenever they want.""

(Reuters) - A former Catholic priest accused of sexually abusing a child in the early 1990s while serving as a military chaplain on a U.S. Air Force base has been extradited from Morocco and will face charges in New Mexico, U.S. officials said on Friday.
The Catholic Church worldwide is reeling from crises involving sexual abuse of minors, deeply damaging confidence in the Church in the United States, Chile, Australia, and Ireland where the scandal has hit hardest, and elsewhere.
An indictment filed in U.S. District Court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Sept. 21, 2017, charges Arthur Perrault, 80, with six counts of aggravated sexual abuse and one count of abusive sexual contact. 
If convicted, Perrault faces a maximum sentence of life in prison for the aggravated sexual abuse charges and up to 10 years in prison for the abusive sexual contact charge, U.S. Attorney John Anderson for the District of New Mexico told a news conference. 
Perrault was arrested by Moroccan authorities shortly after last year's indictment and had been in custody ever since, Special Agent in Charge James Langenberg, of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Albuquerque Division, told the news conference. 
The FBI's investigation located Perrault in Morocco and FBI agents flew there and took custody of him on Thursday, Langenberg said. 
Perrault was expected to appear on Friday before a U.S. magistrate judge when he will be advised of the charges against him, Anderson said. 
It was not immediately known if Perrault had a lawyer.
""There are probably some people who doubted Mr. Perrault would ever be brought back to New Mexico to face a judge after being away for so long. It was important to prove them wrong for one reason - the victim in this case,"" Langenberg said. 
Prosecutors said Perrault is a serial child molester who abused numerous victims over more than 20 years as a priest in New Mexico and Rhode Island. He fled the United States in 1992 when his criminal conduct became public, according to a court document. 
""This indictment alleges a profound breach of trust by a man who was widely perceived as a mentor to young people and a respected figure in the community,"" Anderson said.

The ongoing church sex abuse scandal in the Andean nation has prompted Pope Francis to open an investigation that has led to the resignations of several bishops and priests.
Lawyers for Ricardo Ezzati, the archbishop of Santiago, have requested more time to prepare their case after Ezzati was originally due to be questioned by a civil prosecutor last month. 
Ezzati's defense team, which includes lawyer Hugo Rivera, has determined that the archbishop's case does not qualify as a ""cover-up,"" Rivera told reporters on Friday.
""After a long review of the background ... we are totally and absolutely convinced that this case does not meet the requirements established by law,"" Rivera said.
The lawyers said they are due to discuss a settlement to dismiss the charges with prosecutors before a judge in the central Chilean city of Rancagua on Oct. 5.
The sex abuse crisis has gripped Chile's Catholic Church since 2011, when Chilean priest Fernando Karadima was found guilty by the Vatican of abusing children in the 1970s and 1980s. The allegations prompted a probe that has led to the ousting of bishops and other priests.
All of Chile's 34 bishops offered to resign en masse in May after attending a meeting with the pope over allegations of a cover-up.
Earlier on Friday, Francis accepted the resignations of two more Chilean bishops, bringing the total to seven. 

With the latest resignations, the pope has removed the leadership of about 20 percent of the Latin American country's dioceses.

SAN CRISTOBAL, Venezuela (Reuters) - Dozens of Venezuelans on Friday brought the Andean city of San Cristobal to a standstill by blocking roads with their cars to protest gas shortages that have piled further misery on the OPEC nation's crisis-weary citizens. 
""We have been here since Tuesday night waiting for a delivery truck and it is unacceptable for us to be begging for gasoline in an oil-rich country,"" said Maria Auxiliadora Prato, 68, as she cut off one of the city's main avenues with her car. 
National Guard soldiers later made protesters remove their vehicles from the middle of the street, but angry Venezuelans instead used branches, bottles, tires and garbage bags to snarl traffic.
""We have had to take our pillows to the car to be able to sleep during a three-day wait for 40 liters (10.6 gallons) of gas,"" said protester Cesar Mendez, 41, speaking next to a queue of hundreds of cars waiting for gas. 
""We do not have money to eat the meat that the president eats,"" added a tired-looking Mendez in reference to President Nicolas Maduro's expensive steak dinner at a ""Salt Bae"" restaurant in Istanbul this month. 
Venezuela, which has the world's cheapest gasoline, has been plagued by intermittent fuel shortages in recent months as its oil industry struggles with lower production and problematic refineries. 
Maduro's leftist government blamed the shortages on power cuts in nearby Zulia, an oil-producing state that is suffering near-daily blackouts because government-owned power stations lack maintenance and spare parts. 
Government critics say inept management of Venezuela's oil industry, home to the world's biggest crude reserves, is to blame for the shortages. 
""Tachira without gas, thanks to failed communism,"" tweeted Tachira opposition legislator Franklyn Duarte. 
The government this month also rolled out a new payment system in eight states near the Colombian border, including Tachira where San Cristobal is located, in an attempt to halt widespread smuggling of Venezuela's gas to Colombia. 
Maduro says the payment system will pave the way for charging international prices for fuel - a massive increase given that gas is now almost free - as his government seeks to shore up state coffers amid a hyperinflationary economic meltdown.
The pilot program was designed to provide service stations with wireless devices that use a controversial state-backed identification document to carry out transactions. The document, called the Fatherland Card, is meant to provide subsidies to motorists to help soften the impact of the steep price increases.
Maduro announced on Thursday night that the program would be rolled out in the rest of Venezuela on Monday.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican's most senior official after the pope has strongly defended an upcoming landmark deal between the Holy See and China from criticism by those who say it will be a sell-out to the communist government.
The Vatican and China have been in advanced talks this year to forge what would be an historic breakthrough and a possible precursor to a resumption in diplomatic relations after 70 years, with Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin among the chief architects.
Parolin told reporters he hoped the accord can be signed ""in the not too distant future"".
The accord, which Vatican sources said could be signed in Beijing as soon as next week, would give the Vatican a say in the naming of bishops and give the pope final veto power over candidates.
China's roughly 12 million Catholics are split between an underground Church that swears loyalty to the Vatican, and the state-supervised Catholic Patriotic Association.
The potential deal has divided communities of Catholics across China, some of whom fear greater suppression should the Vatican cede greater control to Beijing, but others want to see rapprochement and avoid a potential schism.
""There is no need to be drastic in condemning and rejecting,"" Parolin told reporters on the sidelines of a book presentation at the Vatican on Thursday night.
One such drastic critic is Cardinal Joseph Zen, the feisty, 76-year-old former archbishop of Hong Kong.
In an interview with Reuters in Hong Kong on Thursday night before Parolin spoke at the Vatican, Zen, in a highly personal attack on the pope's right-hand man, said Parolin should resign.
""I don't think he has faith. He is just a good diplomat in a
very secular, mundane meaning,"" Zen said. ""They're giving the flock into the mouths of the wolves. It's an incredible betrayal.""
Parolin said: ""Everyone has the right to think what they want but it has to be done in a respectful way. We are convinced that this is a step forward. We are not so naive as to think that from now on everything is going to go well, but it seems to us that this is the right direction"".
DEAL PROVISIONAL AND WON'T BE PUBLISHED
Vatican sources have said the complicated deal, which will not be published, is provisional so that it can be reviewed and fine-tuned.
Under the deal, the pope will lift the excommunication of several bishops who were appointed by the government-backed Church without papal approval. A few bishops appointed by Rome will cede their places to bishops who had been appointed by the Vatican.
The sources said that in the future, new bishops will be proposed by local members of the Church, together with the government and the Chinese bishops conference.
The names of candidates will be sent to the Vatican, which will carry out an investigation and the pope will make a final decision, they said.
This means that effectively all bishops on mainland China will recognize the pope's authority for the first time since about 70 years ago, when Beijing severed diplomatic ties with the Vatican.
At a time when the Vatican is also under over a host of sexual abuses scandals in several countries, with one archbishop even calling for the Pope to resign, Zen suggested this China deal would further add to the Church's vulnerability.
""The consequences will be tragic and long lasting, not only for the Church in China but for the whole Church because it damages the credibility. Maybe that's why they might keep the agreement secret,"" Zen said.

The Vatican has stressed the deal is strictly about the appointment of bishops and has nothing to do with Taiwan, which the Vatican still recognizes diplomatically.

Far-right leader Marine Le Pen welcomed the cancellation of rapper Medine's concerts at the Bataclan, where 90 people died in an attack coordinated by Islamic State, calling it ""a victory for all the victims of Islamist terrorism"".
Medine, a 35-year-old artist who has used phrases such as ""crucify the secularists"" and ""I put fatwas on the heads of idiots"" in his songs, told Clique online media last year that he was intentionally provocative to try to shatter stereotypes.
But his plans to hold the two concerts on Oct. 19 and Oct. 20 prompted outcry on the political right, with Le Pen and conservative leader Laurent Wauquiez saying it was an affront to the victims of the bloodshed at the concert hall.
Both staff at the Bataclan and the singer had resisted calls for a cancellation. But they issued statements on Friday saying the concerts would not go ahead.
France, a staunchly secular country, has long struggled to assimilate its large Muslim population, made up mostly of descendants of immigrants from its former colonies. The issue has become only more sensitive since the 2015 attacks.
The concert hall said in a statement the concerts would take place in another venue ""out of respect for the victims"" and their families. It added that ""the freedom of expression of artists ... must remain a fundamental right in our democracy"".
In his own statement, Medine blamed unnamed far-right groups for provoking the outcry, saying they had planned protests that could have posed a security risk at the concerts and had revived the suffering of victims' relatives.
""Out of respect for these families and to guarantee the security of my public, these concerts cannot go ahead,"" he said. He would instead hold an event at the Paris Zenith, a bigger concert hall, on Feb 9, 2019.
The Bataclan reopened one year after the Paris attacks, when a total of 130 people were killed in coordinated gun and suicide attacks that targeted a sports stadium, a string of Paris cafes and the concert venue.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is working to set up a second summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but there is still work to do ""to make sure conditions are right,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday.
“We’re working on it. But there’s still a little bit of work to do left to make sure the conditions are right and that the two leaders are put in a position where we can make substantial progress,” Pompeo told Fox News in an interview.
Pompeo told NBC News in a separate interview that he hoped the meeting could take place ""before too long,"" and that he hoped he himself would get a chance to travel to Pyongyang again to negotiate before that.
But he said international sanctions would have to remain on North Korea until it gave up its nuclear weapons, which are a threat to the United States.
""Ultimately, that’ll be a decision for the president,"" Pompeo said of a second summit between Kim and Trump to follow on from their unprecedented June 12 meeting in Singapore.
""I’m hopeful that I’ll get a chance to travel again to Pyongyang to continue to negotiate before too long,"" Pompeo said. ""And then before too long – and in relatively short order - I hope the two leaders get together again to continue to make progress on this incredible, important issue for the entire world.""
Pompeo added to NBC that important steps had been taken at a summit between the two Koreas this week and that while much more worked needed to be done, the United States had the ""patience and determination"" to achieve its aim.
Referring to sanctions, Pompeo said: ""Those economic sanctions will remain in place until we get to the end, till we get to that final denuclearization, which Chairman Kim promised President Trump he would undertake.""
South Korea President Moon Jae-in said after meeting Kim this week that the North Korean leader wanted a second summit with Trump to hasten denuclearization, but a key goal was declaring an end this year to the 1950-53 Korean War, which halted with an armistice, not a peace treaty.
Pompeo said on Wednesday he had invited North Korea's foreign minister to meet on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York next week and other Pyongyang officials to Vienna for talks with U.S. nuclear envoy Stephen Biegun.
Asked on Thursday if those meetings would take place, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said invitations had been sent and added: ""We certainly stand ready to meet if they are able to.""
Moon said he and Kim spent most of a three-day summit discussing how to break an impasse and restart nuclear talks between Pyongyang and Washington, which are at odds over which should come first - denuclearization or ending the war and sanctions.
Kim, who recently proposed another summit with Trump, said after the summit that North Korea was willing to ""permanently dismantle"" key missile facilities in the presence of outside experts, and also its Yongbyon nuclear complex, if the United States took unspecified corresponding action.
Kim pledged to work toward the ""complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula"" during two earlier meetings with Moon and his encounter with Trump, but follow-up negotiations on how to implement the vague commitments have since faltered.

Washington has called for concrete action and has demanded full disclosure of North Korea's nuclear and missile facilities before satisfying Pyongyang's key demands.

Farage-themed condoms a hit among UK eurosceptics,"BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Nigel Farage, the former leader of Britain's UK Independence Party, has long had a knack for generating publicity for his eurosceptic cause, but campaigners say he had nothing to do with the latest stunt: branded condoms bearing his image.
Among the most attention-grabbing items on sale at this year's UKIP conference in Birmingham on Friday were condoms in packets printed with an image of Farage, eyebrow raised, and the phrase ""For when you have a hard Brexit"" underneath.
""They're one pound each, or two pounds for four - at UKIP we like making deal, so long as it's a good deal,"" said Sebastian Cheek, the 20 year-old student who designed the packet and was selling 200 condoms to raise funds for the party's youth wing.
UKIP is seeking to revive its dwindling political influence at the annual party get-together. Its popularity collapsed following the 2016 vote to leave the European Union and several botched attempts to replace the talismanic Farage as leader.
Farage remains a UKIP member but has tried to steer clear of the limelight to allow the party to develop a new identity - although no one appears to have told the party faithful snapping up the condoms and helping themselves to free framed photos of a grinning Farage standing with U.S. President Donald Trump. 
The array of conference stalls pitches a local branch selling ""I love UKIP"" underwear thongs opposite the party's Christian members' wing offering earnest leaflets on leaving the EU. The official UKIP stall sells bags of Brexit fudge - a sarcastic take on Prime Minister Theresa May's approach to leaving the bloc.

By lunchtime on the first day of the two-day conference, almost half the stock of the Farage condoms had been snapped up: ""It is a reputable condom ... they're going very quickly,"" said Cheek.

The new infection is almost 200 km (125 miles) away from the nearest other known case in Congo's current Ebola outbreak, which is believed to have killed 97 people since July and infected another 46 in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.
Ituri province's Vice Governor Keta Upar said in a statement that the latest Ebola case had been reported in Tchomia on the shores of Lake Albert. It is the closest the disease has come to Uganda, Congo's eastern neighbor.
Uganda's health ministry said on Thursday it was preparing to deploy vaccinations against the virus should it spread to its territory.
Congo has experienced 10 outbreaks of Ebola since it was discovered in the country's forested north in 1976. The disease causes hemorrhagic fever, vomiting and diarrhea and kills about half of the people it infects.
Health officials have made progress slowing the spread of the virus with experimental vaccines and treatments. But violence and turmoil in eastern Congo has made some areas difficult to access.

Dozens have been killed in ethnic clashes between groups in Djugu territory where Tchomia is located, with thousands crossing into Uganda to escape the violence.

Today it resembles a ghost town: dozens of its houses are boarded up, their walls daubed in graffiti and hollowed interiors invaded by creeping vines.
Goussainville-Vieux-Pays lies some 20 km (12 miles) from Paris and should be prime commuter-belt real estate.
But it sits at the end of one of Paris Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport's four runways. Throughout the day low-flying aircraft thunder overhead.
Airport operator Aeroports de Paris bought out willing homeowners when the transport hub opened in the mid 1970s, causing the population to drop to 300 from over 1,000. 
A group of holdouts who refused to leave, however, are now trying to regenerate the village.
""We've thought of all sorts of solutions, even bringing deaf and mute people because, poor them, they wouldn't have been bothered by the planes,"" Philippe Vielliard, one of the group, said.

Goussainville's mayor in 2009 bought back the houses from ADP for the symbolic sum of one euro ($1.18). But it will cost millions to renovate them.

WASHINGTON/PARIS (Reuters) - Nations that struck the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, except for the United States, meet on Monday in what many diplomats fear may prove a quixotic effort to keep the agreement alive after U.S. sanctions targeting Iranian oil exports resume in November.
Ministers from Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and Iran will gather in New York at 8 p.m. EDT on Monday (0000 GMT Tuesday) to grapple with U.S. President Donald Trump's May 8 decision to withdraw from the deal and restore the full force of U.S. sanctions on Iran.
Their delicate, and perhaps unrealistic, task is to build a case for Tehran to respect the deal's limits on its nuclear program even though Washington has pulled out, depriving Iran of many of the economic benefits it was promised.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani ""needs arguments to defend the deal in the face of the radicals. He needs us to give him ammunition,"" said a senior European diplomat, referring to Iranian hard-liners who oppose the agreement.
""We are trying to give him ammunition, but what we can do, to be honest, is limited,"" the diplomat added.
The crux of the deal, negotiated over almost two years by the Obama administration, was that Iran would restrain its nuclear program in return for the relaxation of sanctions that had crippled its economy. Trump considered it flawed because it did not include curbs on ballistic missiles or regional activity.
The United States began reimposing economic sanctions this summer and the most draconian measures, which seek to force Iran's major customers to stop buying its oil, resume Nov. 5.
Their impending return has contributed to a slide in Iran's currency. The rial has lost about two-thirds of its value this year, hitting a record low against the U.S. dollar this month.
The European Union has implemented a law to shield European companies from U.S. sanctions. Still, there are limits to what it can do to counter the oil sanctions, under which Washington can cut off from the U.S. financial system any bank that facilitates an oil transaction with Iran.
""HURT THEM MORE THAN US""
Many European companies are withdrawing or have withdrawn from Iran because of U.S. sanctions that could cut them off from the American market if they stay. 
Iran believes the United States acted in bad faith by withdrawing from the deal even as Tehran has adhered to its terms and has rejected U.S. overtures to meet. 
The most recent confidential report by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Vienna-based U.N. watchdog, found Iran had stayed within the main limitations imposed under the deal, whose formal name is the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
In recent weeks, Iranian officials have begun arguing that if the Europeans cannot preserve trade with Iran, perhaps Tehran should reduce, but not eliminate, its compliance with the accord.
On Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif was quoted as telling Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine that Iran could ""reduce its implementation"" and possibly increase uranium enrichment activities if the deal was jeopardized by ""the actions of the Americans and the passivity of the Europeans.""
European diplomats wish to avoid this. Hoping to keep Iran's nuclear program in check, they have told Tehran that if it stops carrying out the deal to the letter, they will have no choice but to restore their own sanctions.
""They keep telling us the situation is horrible, they are going to leave the accord or just keep partially implementing the deal. It’s the same old music, but for now they continue to implement the JCPOA,"" said a second senior European diplomat.

""We (are) warning them that if they were to pull out it would hurt them more than us,"" he added.

The man, who has not been named for legal reasons, denies the accusations. He will be tried in a juvenile court, since he was aged less than 21 at the time of the alleged crimes. 
The former guard in the SS, the paramilitary wing of Adolf Hitler's Nazi party, stands accused of having known about the killings of hundreds during the three years he served in Stutthof concentration camp near the Polish city of Gdansk.
Between 1942 and 1945, hundreds of prisoners were killed in gas chambers or by having poison injected into their hearts, while others died of exposure or cold, Der Spiegel magazine quoted Muenster prosecutors as saying. 
He would have been at most 21 years old at the end of the war. German prosecutors are keen to see as many perpetrators of Nazi crimes put on trial as possible, but the few remaining suspects are now in extreme old age.
That is creating its own problems beyond the unusual sight of a nonagenarian being tried in a juvenile court. Hearings in the Stutthof case, scheduled to start on Nov. 6, will last a maximum of two hours each day because of the poor health of the suspect.
In another case, it is undecided whether a 93-year-old is mentally fit to undergo trial for alleged wartime crimes.
Last year, a court ruled that Oskar Groening, known as the ""bookkeeper of Auschwitz"" for his job counting cash taken from the extermination camp's victims, must serve time after years of wrangling over whether his health and age permitted a prison term. He died in March, aged 96, before starting his term.
Some six million Jews were killed in the Nazi Holocaust carried out under Hitler.

PARIS (Reuters) - France will press Mali's re-elected President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita on Saturday to move more quickly to bring into force faltering peace accords with rebels as Islamist militants keep up actions to destabilize the West African country.
Bamako is struggling to contain Tuareg and Islamist violence in the north, highlighting the difficulty international partners face in restoring peace in Mali, now a launchpad for attacks by groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State across West Africa.
Former colonial power France intervened in 2013 to drive out Islamist militants that had occupied the north and has since kept about 4,500 troops in the region as part of counter-terrorism operations. French officials acknowledge Paris is likely to remain in the zone for the next decade.
Peace accords from 2015 between the central government and Tuareg rebels in the north have still to be implemented and French officials have become increasingly impatient with the status quo, fearing Keita may delay further ahead of legislative elections in November and December.
""They must not wait for the elections to make the necessary decisions"", a French diplomatic source said ahead of Keita's inauguration ceremony on Saturday which French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian will attend.
The U.N. Security Council in June gave the parties six months to implement the 2015 peace roadmap. The text calls for the beginning of the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) process, which sets a basis for demobilizing or integrating fighters into the Malian army or police. 
""The time for warnings is over,"" France's representative to the Security Council said at the time, accusing leaders of some of the armed groups of deliberately blocking peace efforts and nurturing ties with Islamist militants.
The French diplomatic source said the subject of individual sanctions at the U.N. was on the table. He said Le Drian would put ""respectful"" pressure on the Bamako government.
Led by France, Western powers have provided funding to a regional force made up of soldiers from Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania to combat jihadists. But the so-called G5 force has been hobbled by delays in disbursing the money and poor coordination between the five countries while insecurity has in particular escalated in the border region between Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso.

""We will be able to widen and finalize the financing especially when the force has demonstrated its capacity to be effective on the ground,"" the source said, adding that Paris expected seven or eight battalions to be operational by year-end.

Responses from the industry during New York and London fashion weeks were mixed, with designer Michael Kors among those critical of computer-generated imagery (CGI) being used in this way.
""I am not into a digital model. I am into real people with personalities and opinions,"" Kors said at his show in New York. 
""The idea of digital models is something that I hope does not gain popularity.""
But British designer Alice Temperley believes using CGI could help cut costs.
""I quite like the idea of doing some of that for the commercial and then spending the money on doing events,"" Temperley said at London Fashion Week.
""I think CGI for computer, for website, for selling purposes, for walking backwards and forwards and showing a product on a website is genius, but not necessarily to bring life and flavor into a brand, because that's much more personal.""
Shudu's creator said the rise of CGI in fashion was inevitable. ""After all we see CGI being used in almost every other industry,"" Wilson said in an emailed statement. 
""3D and fashion were two worlds destined to collide."" 
REPLACING MODELS?
Virtual ""influencer"" Miquela has gained 1.4 million Instagram followers since she was created in 2016. Pictures show her in everyday scenarios wearing designer labels and she promoted Prada clothes on the social media platform during February's Milan Fashion Week.
""I think it's good that things change once in a while,"" model Gisele Alicea during New York Fashion Week.
""But I don't think they're ever going to replace models. But then again, the world changes all the time. But I would wish that they would use real models, I don't want to lose my job.""
Model Ashanti Hildreth said she did not feel threatened.
""Virtual reality is going to cost way more than using a real model ... you have to have to pay for someone to edit,"" she said. ""With real people, the clothes just look better.""
In London, model Aweng Choul said the use of digital models took ""the humanity"" away from modeling. 
""Paying a digital model when you should be paying a real model takes away from reality and what human is,"" she said.
Shudu, Zhi and Margot - who are black, Asian and white respectively - have also re-ignited a debate about diversity in the fashion world, which is frequently criticized for the lack of racially-diverse models on the catwalks.
""Where we are at in society right now, I think we need to be uplifting real people and people who deserve the representation that modeling can provide,"" model Hunter Schafer said.
Shudu creator Wilson said CGI could address the issue. 
""I think it's important to explore diversity across as many media as possible, and the (Balmain) campaign was the start of really embracing that,"" he said.
This season, several designers have used a wider range of women for shows. Rihanna's Savage X Fenty lingerie line show featured models of different sizes and races while Temperley had women of various ages. 

""It's cool and interesting, but we feel like ... it's sort of a form of animation,"" David Blond, creative director of The Blonds, said of CGI models. ""I'm sure it can be amazing to utilize at some point but for now we prefer humans.""

Serkan Golge was visiting family in southern Turkey when he was arrested in a crackdown following a failed military coup in 2016 which the government blames on supporters of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen.
Golge's case is similar to that of American pastor Andrew Brunson, whose ongoing detention in Turkey in connection with the coup attempt is the cause of a major row between NATO allies Washington and Ankara, and has led to U.S. President Donald Trump imposing sanctions on Turkey.
In a ruling on Wednesday, Turkey's Court of Appeals changed Golge's conviction charge to aiding, rather than being a member of, a terror organization, and to reduce his 7-1/2-year prison sentence to five years. Golge denied both charges. 
""We have already filed an appeal for his release to a higher court and we will go to the Yargitay (appeals court) afterwards,"" Ali Bilgin, a lawyer representing Golge in Turkey, told Reuters.
Washington welcomed Wednesday's ruling and said it would follow the case closely along with those of other citizens and local U.S. mission employees.
""We welcome the Turkish Court of Appeals' decision to reduce the sentence against Dr. Golge,"" U.S. state Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Thursday. She also called for Golge's release in a case that lacks ""credible evidence"".
Golge was visiting family in southern Turkey when he was arrested. Turkey has detained 160,000 people and dismissed nearly the same number of civil servants over suspected links to the coup attempt, the U.N. human rights office said in March. Of those detained, 77,000 have been formally charged and kept in jail during trial, the interior minister said in April.
Cleric Gulen denies involvement in the attempted putsch in which 250 people were killed. 

Along with sanctions, Trump has imposed double traded tariffs on Turkey, exacerbating a slide in the lira.

Fifteen Russian crew were killed when an IL-20 surveillance plane crashed near Latakia in northern Syria on Monday. Russia has said Syria shot the plane down shortly after Israeli jets hit a target in the area.
Initially the incident appeared likely to cause friction between Israel and Russia, with the Defence Ministry in Moscow accusing Israel of indirectly causing it. But President Vladimir Putin later called it ""a chain of tragic, chance events.""
An Israeli delegation led by its air force chief this week presented Moscow with its findings on the incident, ""including recordings of the conversations between the Israeli air force and the Russian air force component in Syria,"" said the Israeli official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
""We proved how the Syrian reckless anti-air fire was the direct cause of hitting the Russian aircraft. They fired quite recklessly and irresponsibly and unprofessionally into the air long after our planes were no longer there,"" the official said.
More than 20 Syrian anti-aircraft missiles were fired during the incident, the official said.
""Our Russian counterparts had a few questions, those questions were answered,"" the official said. ""Our impression is that the discussions were professional and that the information was well accepted.""
Russia's Defence Ministry was initially critical of Israel, saying it had only given Moscow one minute's warning before its jets attacked, putting the Russian aircraft in danger of being caught in cross-fire.
But the Israeli official said: ""We definitely gave a warning, a time much longer than one minute. We acted in accordance with the standard operating procedures that are in place with the Russian military.""
Any dispute between Israel and Russia could lessen Israel's ability to carry out air strikes inside Syria against what it regards as the greatest threat to Israel's security from the country's civil war - build-ups of Iranian forces or those of Iran's Shi'ite ally, Hezbollah.
Since intervening in Syria in 2015, Russia has usually turned a blind eye to Israeli attacks. Israel has launched about 200 such raids in the last two years, Israeli officials say.
The Israeli official said the meeting in Moscow was an opportunity to improve the mechanism the countries have been using to avoid unintended confrontations.
""But our freedom of movement is paramount ... The IDF (Israeli Defence Forces) will continue to implement our strategic interests,"" the official said.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday Brexit talks with the European Union had hit an impasse, defiantly challenging the bloc to come up with their own plans a day after the bloc's leaders savaged her proposals.
At a summit in Austria on Thursday, EU leaders rejected May's ""Chequers"" plan, saying she needed to give ground on trade and customs arrangements for the UK border with Ireland.
The British media said the response had left her proposals in tatters, and May angrily struck back in a televised address from her Downing Street office, saying neither side should expect the impossible from the other. 
""Throughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect,"" May said. ""The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.""
Sterling extended its losses as May spoke, falling to as low as $1.3080, about 1.4 percent on the day, putting it on course for its biggest one-day drop this year, over growing fears Britain could leave the EU without any deal.
May has said the Chequers proposals for trade with the EU, which would resolve arguments over the border of Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic, were the only way forward. EU leaders in Salzburg repeated their view that the plans would undermine their cherished single market.
After the summit, EU leaders said they would push for an agreement next month, but both sides have warned they are planning for a no-deal scenario.
""It's not acceptable to simply reject the other side's proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals,"" May said. ""So we now need to hear from the EU what the real issues are, what their alternative is, so that we can discuss them. Until we do, we cannot make progress.""
May, who commands a majority in parliament only with the support of a small pro-Brexit Northern Irish party, said she could not agree to any deal which treated Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the United Kingdom.
The EU insists that there can be no hard border between the British province and the Irish Republic, with Northern Ireland remaining in the bloc's customs union or effectively establishing a border in the Irish Sea if no alternative deal is reached.
""WE STAND READY""
""I will not overturn the result of the referendum nor will I break up my country,"" she said. ""We need serious engagement on resolving the two main problems in the negotiations and we stand ready."" 
However, she said no matter what happened, the rights of three million EU citizens living in the United Kingdom would be protected. 
Earlier, her Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said some EU leaders had shown unstatesmanlike behavior in Salzburg.
""We've already compromised hugely with the Chequers proposals,"" Raab told BBC TV. ""What we're not going to do is be salami sliced throughout this negotiation in a typical style that the EU engages in without movement on the other side.""
For the British media, the message from Salzburg had been clear. ""Your Brexit's broken,"" the Daily Mirror newspaper said.
Newspapers led their front pages with a Reuters picture showing May, dressed in a red jacket, standing apparently aloof and alone from a mass of suited male EU leaders. 
May faces a fight with angry Conservative lawmakers at her party's annual conference from Sept. 30. 
Many have voiced opposition to her plans, which they said would bind Britain into much EU regulation in return for free trade, and some would prefer a no-deal ""hard Brexit"" in March, despite warnings that would ravage the British economy.
""Theresa May's Brexit negotiating strategy has been a disaster,"" opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said. ""The Tories have spent more time arguing among themselves than negotiating with the EU.
""The political games from both the EU and our government need to end because no deal is not an option."" 
In response to May's statement, the Confederation of British Industry and other business bodies said they wanted to see constructive dialogue, not rhetoric.
Last week, London Mayor Sadiq Khan added his voice to those including union and business leaders who said there should be a second Brexit referendum. Scotland's top court ruled on Friday that the European Court of Justice should consider whether Britain could unilaterally change its mind on Brexit.

""The referendum was the largest democratic exercise this country has ever undergone,"" said May, who has repeatedly ruled out a second vote following the original 2016 referendum. ""To deny its legitimacy or frustrate its result threatens public trust in our democracy.""

SPD leader Andrea Nahles has been criticized by members of her own center-left party for agreeing to a deal that saw spymaster Hans-Georg Maassen removed from the BfV agency and promoted to a senior job at the interior ministry.
""The overwhelmingly negative reactions from citizens show that we made a mistake,"" Nahles wrote to Merkel and Interior Minister Horst Seehofer in a letter seen by Reuters. ""We have lost trust instead of restoring it. That should give us all reason to pause and reconsider the agreement.""
The letter effectively plunges the government in which the SPD are Merkel's junior coalition partners into a crisis.

Kahlon said he had instructed that any sum paid to the attacker's family be withheld from tax revenue that Israel collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority (PA) under interim peace deals.
""I will examine other ways to limit the economic activity of the terrorist's family,"" he said on Twitter.
American-born Ari Fuld, 45, was stabbed at a shopping mall in the Etzion bloc of Jewish settlements south of Jerusalem on Sunday. His attacker, Khalil Youssef Jabarin, 17, from a village in the occupied West Bank, was shot at the scene and has since been in Israeli custody.
It has not yet been decided whether Jabarin and his family will receive payments, according to a Palestinian official.
Israel has in the past withheld tax funds and in July enacted a law to financially penalize the PA by the amount of stipends paid to Palestinians jailed by Israel, their families, and the families of those killed by Israeli forces.
Israel says such stipends are a reward and encouragement for the prisoners’ actions against it. The Palestinian Authority says they are welfare payments to support them and their families. 
The PA, which has limited self-rule in the West Bank, where Israel retains overall security control, pays stipends that start at 1,400 shekels ($392) after a prisoner has been detained for three months. Amounts differ depending on the length of sentence.

Earlier this year, U.S. lawmakers enacted legislation to sharply reduce the annual $300 million in U.S. aid to the PA unless it took steps to stop making what lawmakers described as payments that reward violent crime.

Under legislation introduced in 2015, French cities have the right to introduce urban tolls, but only on an experimental basis and for a maximum of three years. 
""No city will invest in congestion pricing infrastructure on those terms. The legislative framework is too constraining, it needs to evolve,"" said the source.
The Transport Ministry is preparing a decree on congestion pricing as part of a new law on mobility that will be presented this autumn, he said. 
Singapore, London, Stockholm and Milan have all introduced congestion pricing systems, but no French city has done so, although France has an extensive toll system on its highways. 
In October 2017, Paris's deputy mayor for urban planning, Jean-Louis Missika, said the idea of urban tolls was worth considering, but mayor Anne Hidalgo said she did not want a financial barrier to entering the city.
The city has, however, increased parking fees and introduced a sticker system to keep the most polluting cars off its roads on days when pollution levels are high. Hidalgo also said last year that Paris wants to ban petrol- and diesel-fueled cars from its roads by 2030.
Sources close to the city government say Paris transport officials are still studying the idea of tolls, although they are unlikely to be introduced before municipal elections in 2020.

Lavrov arrived in Bosnia two weeks before Bosnia's national election, a visit described by local media as a show of support for Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik, even though the Russian said he was not making a recommendation as to who to vote for.
Dodik, who is running for a Serb seat in Bosnia's inter-ethnic presidency, is campaigning on a ticket of a wider autonomy of the Serb Republic that he currently presides over and its ultimate secession from Bosnia.
Dodik, who favors closer ties with Russia rather than the West, hopes that Russia will support his separatist plans at the time when a land swap has been discussed between Serbia and Kosovo, meaning that borders at the Balkans may change again but this time with international blessing.
However, Lavrov, who is due to meet Dodik later, gave no public support for the separatist move. 
""Russia's stance is there is no alternative to the Dayton peace agreement,"" Lavrov said at a news conference in Sarajevo held with his Bosnian counterpart Igor Crnadak, referring to the US.-brokered peace deal that ended Bosnia's 1992-95 war.
""We support Bosnia's sovereignty, territorial integrity and the authorities granted by the constitution to its two entities and three constituent peoples,"" he said.
Lavrov dismissed allegations that Russia favored and supported particular politicians ahead of the Oct. 7 vote.
""We never make recommendations to anyone for who to vote when it comes to foreign countries, and (we) will always respect the choice of Bosnian citizens and work with those who they entrust,"" he said.
But he also said that other world powers should not interfere in the Balkans and create new confrontations in the volatile region.

Lavrov will also go to Banja Luka, the Serb Republic's de facto capital, where he will talk to the region's leaders and visit the site of a future Serbian-Russian Orthodox cultural center, joined by Serbia's Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic.

MISRATA, Libya (Reuters) - The queue snakes out of the departures hall and deep into the carpark at Libya's small Misrata airport - the main remaining gateway in and out of the country since fighting shut down the last runways in the capital Tripoli.
The people lined up with their luggage are the lucky ones. Others wait for their chance to queue - sitting on the pavement, one man camped out on a stalled baggage conveyor belt, trying to get some sleep with his head resting on his suitcase.
Misrata airport on Libya's northwestern Mediterranean coast processed three to four flights a day last month.
Then armed groups fighting for territory and influence 200 km (125 miles) further west fired rockets toward Tripoli's main remaining air hub - the latest in a long line of clashes since the 2011 overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi.
Flights were rerouted to Misrata. Ever since, its warehouse-sized terminal has been packed with up to 6,000 passengers pouring on and off dozens of flights every day, say officials. 
""Misrata airport is not capable of handling these numbers,"" said Soliman al-Jahimy, the airport's spokesman.
In another part of the building, scores of migrants from other parts of Africa - who were stopped in Libya as they tried to get on to Europe - wait for U.N. flights to take them back home.
Elsewhere businessmen wait next to stranded families and elderly relatives in wheelchairs - hotels rooms are scarce in the city and flights are repeatedly delayed or canceled. Many wait for seven hours or more.
Beyond Misrata, the other options are a tiny airport in the western town of Zuwara, next to the Tunisian border, sometimes used by diplomats - and less busy airports in eastern Libya, a territory run by a rival administration, opposed to the U.N.-backed administration in the west.
All are clustered on the coast, far from the country's southern desert hinterlands which are beset by their own chaos and fighting between tribes and other armed groups that shut the airport in that region's main city Sebha in January 2014.
""Getting here was a disaster,"" says Basheer Hassan, exhausted after his long trek to Misrata.
""There were no flights operating in the south to Tripoli or to Misrata, so we had to drive here and I suffered all the way.""

VATICAN CITY/VILNIUS (Reuters) - Pope Francis will carry a message of solidarity to the Baltic nations on a visit starting on Saturday, nearly 30 years after they broke away from the Soviet Union and as they look warily toward a newly aggressive Russia.
The four-day trip is the first by a pope to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia since 1993 and, a quarter of a century on, the countries are members of NATO and the euro zone.
But the past still looms large in a region subject in turn to Soviet and Nazi oppression and where religious persecution left a traumatic legacy.
In Lithuania, where he starts his trip, Francis will visit the Vilnius Museum of Occupations and Freedom Fights, a former Soviet KGB prison where hundreds were murdered and thousands, including many priests, shipped off to Siberia.
""By visiting the KGB jail, Pope Francis sends a message that he cares about the people who suffered for their faith, for their devotion to the motherland,"" said Bishop Sigitas Tamkevicius, 79, imprisoned there in 1983 before spending six years in Soviet labor camps.
""This was our nation's Golgotha, a trial of our faith,"" Tamkevicius, who will accompany the pope to the jail, told Reuters.
The region also still bears the inter-religious scars left by the murder of more than 200,000 Jews by the Nazis, aided by some locals. The pope will pray at a monument to the victims of the Vilnius ghetto, where only several hundred of some 40,000 survived the Holocaust.
HOPE FOR THE FUTURE
After independence won in 1918, the countries were annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, occupied by the Nazis during World War Two and were then satellite republics of the USSR until 1991.
Recent events in Russia, with which all three states share a land border, have brought on new nervousness.
As Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and fears grew that the Baltics might be next on Moscow's list, defense spending was increased sharply and several thousand NATO soldiers were deployed.
The Baltics say they are victims of a sustained anti-western disinformation campaign by Russia and subjected to regular intimidation tactics including cyber attacks - charges the Kremlin denies.
In 1993, Pope John Paul helped the three countries celebrate their liberation.
While political freedoms in the Baltic states remain hard-won, in one respect Francis' trip will be very different, with their wealth having shot up thanks to an export-oriented boom.
""There was great hope for the future (and) the economic situation was very difficult"" in 1993, Archbishop Gintaras Grusas of Vilnius, told Reuters.
About 77 percent of Lithuania's population of 2.9 million are Catholic, while Catholicism is a minority in the other two countries.
In Riga, Francis will pay tribute to Latvia's independence heroes at the Monument to Freedom and preside over at an ecumenical service at the city's Lutheran cathedral.

In Tallinn, Estonia - where the Vatican says there are only about 4,500 Catholics - Francis will say Mass in Freedom Square (NYSE:SQ), the site of military parades in Soviet times was where thousands of candles are burned each year to commemorate Soviet deportees.

778,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>",Maldives president Yameen a hardliner who jailed his own brother,"MALE (Reuters) - Maldives president Abdulla Yameen is a ruthless political operator who has cracked down on threats to his rule, say diplomats and former colleagues - including jailing his own half-brother in an on-off feud dating from childhood.
The Maldives, a luxury holiday destination and a key nation in India and China's battle for regional influence, goes to the polls on Sunday.
Yameen, who took power in 2013, is seeking a second five-year term in an election criticized for a lack of freedom. 
He has jailed critics, reined in the media, and purged dissenting voices from institutions such as the Supreme Court after a political crisis in February. 
EARLY BEGINNINGS
Born in 1959, Yameen started work as a clerk in the finance department in 1978, the same year his half-brother Maumoon Abdul Gayoom took power, ruling until 2008.
In the early days, Yameen commuted to work on a bicycle - then a perk on an isolated archipelago with few cars. 
He went on to work at the Maldives Monetary Authority and the ministry of trade, where he became minister under Gayoom in 1993. 
But a series of cables written in between 2003 and 2008 by the U.S. Embassy in Sri Lanka spoke of rifts between the two men, exacerbated by Yameen's own political ambitions. 
The cables also said Gayoom was committed to introducing democratic reforms but was being held back by ""hardliners"" like Yameen, ""who realize they would lose everything if Gayoom lost power and thus were fighting the reform process tooth and nail"".
Former foreign minister Ahmed Naseem, who worked with Yameen during the 1980s in the trade ministry, told Reuters the president never had a good relationship with Gayoom, right from childhood.
Gayoom's family came from Malé, the capital, while Yameen's mother came from a poorer outlying island, a source who knew the brothers said. 
""The two families never got along: they were never treated equally and that dragged in to the next generation as well,"" the source said. 
Gayoom relinquished power in 2008 to Mohamed Nasheed, a British-educated opposition politician who famously held a cabinet meeting underwater to protest against rising sea levels.
Yameen became president in 2013 in a rerun election initially won by Nasheed, before the Supreme Court annulled the result. 
Nasheed was sentenced to jail in 2015 for terror offences. 
Gayoom, 80, who played a vital role in securing the 2013 election for Yameen, joined the opposition against his half-sibling in 2017. In June he too was jailed, for an alleged plot to topple Yameen. 
COMBATIVE STYLE
Yameen is driven around the country in a Mercedes-Benz, with an entourage of soldiers from the Maldives National Defence Force in combat gear.
He stepped up his security after an unexplained explosion on his yacht in 2015 wounded his wife and a bodyguard.
Yameen pulled the Maldives out of the Commonwealth in 2016 after international criticism, and has drawn closer to China, to the alarm of traditional ally India, in a Beijing-backed infrastructure boom meant to stimulate the economy.
In 2016 he swapped his private residence for a larger plot of land located near the construction site of the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge. 
Known for referring to himself as ""President Yameen"" in speeches, he often adopts a confrontational style, demanding votes from supporters. At a rally last week, he compared Maldivians to children.

""I sometimes think our young children are more intelligent than Maldivian adults,"" he said. ""If there is a children's vote, President Yameen will win by a (margin of) 100 out of 100.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Carol Donovan became convinced 2018 could be a good year for Democrats in Dallas County, Texas, when so many enthusiasts jammed into the party's annual fish fry fundraiser last October that they ran out of catfish.
What the county Democratic chair Donovan saw at the event is backed up by a new Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll, which found enthusiasm among Democrats is soaring ahead of elections on Nov. 6 that will determine whether Republicans maintain control over the U.S. Congress.
Across almost all demographic groups, more Democrats say they are certain to vote compared to poll results in 2014, the last non-presidential election year.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll has been tracking Americans' interest in voting since 2010 and the polling on voter enthusiasm is built on data spanning 2014 to 2018, including data not readily available elsewhere.
White women Democrats over the age of 60 are leading the way: 74 percent said they are certain to vote on Nov. 6, up 18 percentage points from four years ago. 
Among Republicans, 64 percent of older white women expressed certainty to vote, down 4 points from 2014 and a shift in the enthusiasm gap of 22 percentage points.
It is not just older women expressing an eagerness to vote.
The opinion poll, conducted from Aug. 20 to Sept. 16, found that Democrats have the edge in enthusiasm within most major demographic groups: college graduates, people between 18 and 34 years old - the so-called millennial generation - and mid-career adults.
Even among groups often thought to favor U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, like whites without a college degree and avid church goers, those who identify as Democrats are more interested in voting this year, while Republicans are not.
For detailed opinion poll data, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2ppgaGt
Enthusiasm is everything in the congressional elections, when turnout is typically lower than when the White House is also up for grabs. Only about four in 10 voting-age Americans bother to cast ballots compared to about six in 10 when it is. 
When voters in one party are especially determined to be heard in a congressional election, it can swing control of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate.
In 2010, for example, months after Democrats passed President Barack Obama's healthcare legislation, a surge in turnout among Republican voters helped their party retake the House, according to data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a survey run by a consortium of academic institutions. 
It is not unusual for the party out of power to have a greater interest in voting, said Jan Leighley, a political scientist at American University. But Trump cranks the interest level even higher among Democrats this year, she said, because he's ""undoing everything that Obama did – just trashing Obama's record. That's going to raise the stakes for Democrats.""
Trump also nominated conservative judge and former Republican Bush administration lawyer Brett Kavanaugh for the U.S. Supreme Court, another factor galvanizing Democrats to vote in November. 
ENTHUSIASM OR JUST NOISE? 
Donovan, the Dallas County Democratic party boss in a region of 2.5 million people, agreed Trump is the motivator.
""Some people are inspired to vote because they are afraid of what he's going to do. And some are inspired because they're so aghast at what he's already done,"" Donovan said.
Her office needed to print 50,000 more voter information packets because so many people were volunteering to get out the vote as the usual 75,000 ran out. Dallas County Democrats will run a candidate in every major race in November for the first time in at least 20 years, she said.
The Democrats' nominee for the U.S. Senate, Representative Beto O'Rourke, threatens to unseat incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz, according to a Reuters opinion poll.
Donovan's Republican counterpart, Missy Shorey, said much of the excitement among Democrats has been drummed up by ""extremists who are making a tremendous amount of noise.""
She has seen promising signs of enthusiasm among Republicans too. This year, about 250 people have established themselves as precinct chairs, nearly double the number from 2014, to help get out the vote.
""Just because Democrats are loud and screaming doesn't mean that people are listening,"" Shorey said.
There are a few bright spots for Republicans. Interest in voting is up about 4 points this year among Republicans between 30 and 39 years old and up about 2 points among college-educated women.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States. It asked people to rate on a scale of 1 to 10 their interest in voting in November's election, 10 signifying they are certain to vote. 
Altogether, the poll gathered responses in 2018 from 14,620 adults, including 6,003 Democrats and 5,436 Republicans. The results were compared against a poll that ran from Aug. 20 to Sept. 16, 2014 with responses from 9,179 adults, including 3,625 Democrats and 3,058 Republicans.

The polls have a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 1 percentage point for the entire group and 5 points for smaller groups such as older women Democrats.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo launched his re-election campaign on Friday, looking to win over big blocs of millennial and Muslim voters as Southeast Asia's biggest economy sails into choppy waters. 
At next year's election on April 17, the former furniture salesman seeks to repeat his 2014 defeat of Prabowo Subianto, a retired special forces commander, when Widodo won a narrow victory after a fierce battle. 
Now each is pushing a nationalistic economic platform, but issues of race and religion loom large in the battle to run the world's largest Muslim-majority country, whose reputation for pluralism is threatened by growing conservatism.
""Differences in voting are fine, but don't forget our unity as a people, as a country,"" Widodo told reporters in downtown Jakarta just hours before drawing a number at the election commission to decide his position on the ballot.
""What's important is not to let there be divisions between people, friends, communities."" 
Opinion polls give Widodo a double-digit lead over Prabowo, as he is usually referred to by Indonesians, but some show the gap narrowing as the campaign begins. 
MILLENNIAL APPEAL
Both sides are battling for the support of Indonesia's roughly 80 million millennials, who form more than 40 percent of voters. 
Widodo's advisers have pored over surveys of millennials' views and one, who declined to be identified without authorization to speak to the media, said ""sports, music, and film"" were being targeted for their appeal to the group. 
Indonesians are avid users of social media, which is crucial to election canvassing in the sprawling archipelago.
A video sequence featuring the 57-year-old president in a motorbike stunt last month, when he appeared to roar into the opening ceremony of the Asian Games, proved wildly popular.
Footage of Widodo doing a dance move with K-Pop band Super Junior on a visit to Seoul went viral, and a quip in an economic speech that he was one of a team of superheroes, ""The Avengers"", fighting trade wars, spawned memes and hashtags.
By contrast, the opposition is deploying its online slogan '#GantiPresiden2019' (Change the President in 2019), to highlight growing economic pressure, as the rupiah currency has plunged 9 percent this year in an emerging market selloff.
Fuad Bawazier, a former finance minister who is an economic adviser to Prabowo, dismisses the government's measures to maintain economic stability as ""rhetoric"".
The opposition accuses Widodo of failing to reduce income inequality and deliver on a 2014 campaign pledge of 7 percent growth. It vows to ""save Indonesia from an economic downturn"" in its manifesto. 
Although growth has stalled at about 5 percent in recent years, Widodo can justify his image of a hands-on leader by pointing to a boom in infrastructure projects, ranging from airports to subways, and a dramatic slashing of red tape.
""On paper, it looks like Jokowi can't lose,"" said Achmad Sukarsono, a political analyst at Control Risks, using the president's nickname. 
""But the way the economy goes is going to be very important."" 
ISLAMIST INFLUENCE
The most incendiary attacks have targeted Widodo's religion and ethnicity, such as false accusations that he is a Christian and the son of Chinese communists. 
To blunt such claims, Widodo chose as his running mate a conservative cleric from Indonesia's largest Muslim group, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), which has around 40 million members.
Coalition members say Ma'ruf Amin's nomination is aimed to woo the Muslim vote and assuage doubt over Widodo's religious convictions.
But some Widodo supporters took issue with Amin, 75, to whom they attribute a key role in fuelling intolerance.
""There is a real fear his conservatism could influence the policy climate and the direction the country is moving in,"" said a senior member of the NU group who is close to Widodo. 
As head of a council of Muslim clerics, Amin issued fatwas condemning minority groups.
""Jokowi will have to come up with a well-thought-out strategy to contain Ma'ruf Amin's conservative influence,"" added the NU source, who sought anonymity because the topic is sensitive.
By contrast, Prabowo chose 49-year-old Sandiaga Uno - a suave, U.S.-educated businessman who ran successfully last year to be Jakarta's vice governor, before resigning to be his running mate.

Prabowo has also long courted Islamist groups, and this week accepted endorsement by hardline clerics who were behind mass protests last year that brought down Jakarta's then governor, an ethnic Chinese Christian.

Authorities have carried out regular sweeps against alleged supporters of the cleric Fethullah Gulen since the coup attempt of July 2016, in which 250 people were killed. Gulen denies involvement.
Turkey's Western allies have criticized the crackdown, which mostly took place under a state of emergency declared shortly after the coup attempt and remained in effect until July 2018.

BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - The United Kingdom Independence Party has no plans to join an anti-European Union campaign masterminded by U.S. President Donald Trump's former strategist Steve Bannon, UKIP's leader told Reuters.
The party was one of the driving forces behind Britain's vote to leave the European Union, under former leader Nigel Farage. Current leader Gerard Batten has pushed a more anti-Islam message since, and some have criticized his engagement with far-right figures.
""I've never met Steve Bannon. As far as I'm concerned he's an interesting character obviously because of what he did in America,"" Batten said on Friday in the central English city of Birmingham, where the party is holding its annual conference.
""I'm not quite sure what he is proposing across Europe but UKIP doesn't fit into that. UKIP is a British party that is going to pursue aims for the British people.""
Batten added: ""If he phoned me up and said he'd like to have a coffee and a chat I'd say 'fine that's great,' but I have no agenda to do anything with Steve Bannon."" 
Bannon, a former chairman of the right-wing Breitbart.com website and an architect of Trump's 2016 election win, has launched a project to coordinate and bolster the anti-EU vote across the European Union.
So far, Bannon has focused his efforts in Britain on eurosceptic politicians in Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party who could challenge her leadership. One, Jacob Rees-Mogg, distanced himself from Bannon this week.
The UKIP leader has been condemned for his comments on Islam, which he once described as a ""death cult"".
""Why is it far-right to criticize an ideology? I have an opinion on it which a lot of people share - that it's a very unpleasant ideology,"" he said of Islam. 
""If the British public agree with me they'll support UKIP. If they don't, they won't and then UKIP can find another leader."" 
ELECTION RED ALERT
Since the 2016 Brexit vote UKIP has struggled, seeing its support evaporate in a 2017 election and undergoing a lengthy struggle to find the right leader to replace the talismanic Farage. 
Batten, who attended UKIP's first meeting more than 25 years ago, is only committed to lead the party until March 2019 and has yet to decide if he will serve beyond that. He is currently also a member of the European parliament.
He said his immediate task was to rebuild the party's support base and influence in national politics. 
Asked if he expected a national election in the near future, Batten said he had put the party on ""red alert"" but that it was difficult to predict what would happen to May's government. He said UKIP would focus on marginal seats where it could help push pro-EU lawmakers out of parliament.
Earlier, he launched a 17-page manifesto setting out what he said were ""populist"" policies, seeking to rediscover the everyman appeal that once made the party a threat to both the Conservatives and opposition Labour Party.

""The people who count the numbers in the Tories (Conservatives) and Labour won't be laughing at us, they're too sensible for that,"" he said. ""They'll be thinking 'hang on a minute, UKIP hasn't disappeared off the scene'.""

790,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 04:58AM ET</span>",Where are the 'good days'? Challenges mount for India's Modi,"By Krishna N. Das and Sanjeev Miglani
NEW DELHI/BHOMADA, India (Reuters) - Narendra Modi swept India's 2014 general election with the slogan ""Achhe din (good days) are coming"".
Four years later, as Prime Minister Modi mobilizes to win re-election in May, he and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are being buffeted for a lack of jobs, falling farm prices and rural wages, a tax reform that led to unemployment and a demonetization exercise that sapped liquidity.
Despite high economic growth, the fall of the rupee currency to record lows this year has led to a surge in prices of largely imported fuel, which is feeding into inflation. Nationwide protests have broken out because of the price rise.
""There's no improvement in our life - we eat two basic meals a day but struggle to save for soap and detergent,"" Misri Lal, 52, said in Bhomada village in central India's Madhya Pradesh state, where he earns $2 a day watching over a yellowish-green soybean farm.
In a series of interviews in India's political heartland, the northern and central plains, many people said they had been disappointed by Modi's government. But in a nation of 1.3 billion people, it was difficult to estimate how far the disillusionment had spread and how much it could affect Modi and the BJP at the next general election.
Despite its fitful performance on the economy, the BJP remains robustly Hindu nationalist, which plays well among many voters. Modi's aides insist that the party will not suffer in the election next year and will repeat the 2014 performance.
They also say the BJP will do well in three big state elections due later in 2018, which could signal how things will go in the general election. 
Opinion polls predict Modi will return to power next year, but said the gap against the opposition was narrowing. 
But ""achhe din"", which has become synonymous with Modi and his rule, is being mocked on social media in India. A cartoon widely distributed on Facebook's WhatsApp messaging platform had a man looking through a telescope for ""good days"". Another had Modi sitting in front of a spinning wheel weaving ""achhe din"" stories.
Some BJP officials privately say they are not quite sure of sentiment in the small towns and villages of rural India, where two-thirds of the people live.
Lal, the farm hand, said he was a long-time BJP supporter but it was time for change.
""We have always voted for them but people are angry now. It appears things will change this time around,"" Lal said, his wife and two grandchildren looking on from near their tin shed in the middle of the unfenced soybean fields.
RURAL PAIN
The Modi administration has acknowledged that farmers are suffering in a country where agriculture is the biggest employer, engaging 263 million people or 55 percent of the total number of workers.
""Trends in inflation clearly show that farmers are under distress due to un-remunerative prices and need to be compensated appropriately,"" India's farm ministry said in a report sent to states last month and seen by Reuters. 
Rural wages have weakened across India compared to a high growth period during the rule of the center-left Congress party which aggressively promoted a rural jobs scheme that guaranteed every citizen paid work for at least 100 days in a year. Economists say its impact has now leveled out.
A boom in the construction sector had sustained the growth in wages but that has since slowed down dramatically, dragged by Modi's November 2016 move to suck high value currency notes out of the system to combat corruption and then a sweeping goods and services tax (GST) that businesses are struggling to adapt to.
Average inflation-adjusted growth in rural wages fell to 0.45 percent between 2015/16 and 2017/18, compared with 11.18 percent between 2012/13 and 2014/15, said India Ratings & Research, a unit of international agency Fitch.
The Reserve Bank of India says that high growth in rural wages from 2007/08 to 2012/13 was followed by a phase of ""significant deceleration"".
""GST and demonetization have really depressed the construction industry. I get only 20 percent of the work I used to get before demonetization,"" said Chotelal Rajput, a construction contractor in the Madhya Pradesh capital Bhopal, as he stopped by a busy roundabout where dozens of laborers gathered to be hired for daily wages.
In Wai, a small town south of Mumbai, migrant worker Mithilesh Yadav said he voted for Modi at the last election but would not do so again.
""The BJP was talking about bringing down inflation, bringing down petrol and diesel prices, but instead they are raising prices every day,"" the 26-year-old said. ""All tall claims made by Modi were just advertising and we fell for it. I won't commit the mistake again.""
IT'S JOBS
Many political analysts say Modi's failure to create tens of millions of jobs for the country's youth - a promise which helped him secure the largest mandate in three decades in 2014 - would be the biggest threat to his bid for another term.
""No one here will vote for Modi,"" said Rakesh Kumar, a college graduate in the town of Kasba Bonli in northern Rajasthan state who says he has worked as a house painter because he could not get any other employment.
Kumar said he finally found a job as a teacher in a private college last month but his paltry monthly salary of 8,000 rupees (about $111) meant his six brothers worked as manual laborers.
The town voted overwhelmingly for the BJP in 2014.
In Panipat, a town north of the capital Delhi, workers in textile mills said hundreds had been laid off because many small business owners could not cope with the complexities of the new GST regime and had shut shop.
Gopal Krishna Agarwal, a BJP spokesman, said the country could not expect the Modi government to resolve all its problems in so short a time.
""India has been independent for more than 70 years and we can't say that problems that have persisted for around 65 years would go away in four and half years,"" he said.
""We're not saying every problem has been solved but our focus and direction are correct.""
The BJP is also confident about its prospects next year because of the fractured opposition. Rahul Gandhi of the Congress is Modi's main opponent, but there are a host of regional parties that are likely to divide the opposition vote.
India Today news magazine published a survey last month predicting the BJP would lose seats compared to 2014, but retain just enough to form a government with allies if the opposition remained divided. It predicted the BJP would win 36 percent of the vote and Congress 31 percent, but said smaller parties would get 33 percent.
Gandhi told a group of journalists last month that a ""robust opposition alliance"" would be in place before the 2019 election and that a candidate of a unified opposition would go up against the BJP in each constituency.
""More damage has been done to India by this government than any in the past and everyone recognizes the over-riding need to thwart them,"" Gandhi said, referring to the BJP's Hindu nationalist agenda that critics say has targeted the country's minorities.
Subhanshu Sethia, a college student in the northern town of Meerut, said Modi's singular failure had been the lack of jobs.
""Achhe din is only for the rich, the businessmen who get fat contracts, for the rest of us it has been a let down,"" he said.
""There is a war out there for jobs.""

""In Malaysia there are some things we cannot accept, even though it is seen as human rights in Western countries,"" Mahathir, 93, told reporters. ""We cannot accept LGBT, marriage between men and men, women and women.""
His comments are likely to spark further debate in the country where activists have voiced concern over the hostility towards LGBT groups both from within society and from the administration.
Two women were caned this month for ""attempting lesbian sex"" in Terengganu, a conservative state in the east. Mahathir denounced the punishment, saying it ""did not reflect the justice or compassion of Islam"".

BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Friday placed one of the country's most senior ethnic Uighur officials, head of the energy administration and a former governor of the restive region of Xinjiang, under investigation for suspected graft.
The ruling Communist Party's anti-graft watchdog said in a brief statement National Energy Administration Director Nur Bekri was being probed on suspicion of breaking the law and violating party discipline, the usual euphemism for graft but which could also refer to other legal problems.
It gave no other details and it was not possible to reach Nur Bekri for comment.
President Xi Jinping has targeted the energy sector as part of a wider war against pervasive graft that began when he came into office six years ago.
Nur Bekri, 57, worked in Xinjiang until moving to Beijing in late 2014 to head the energy administration. He is also a deputy head of China's powerful state planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission.
Nur Bekri, a tall, jocular figure who speaks almost totally unaccented Mandarin and was known for being more open to foreign media than most Chinese officials, was the 12th senior official from the energy administration to be felled since it was founded in 2008.
In Xinjiang, he had been a strong proponent of expanding the resource-rich region's coal-mining sector, but his advocacy for the polluting industry was tempered in favor of promoting cleaner projects after he came to Beijing.
He is one of the few Uighurs - a Muslim people who speak a Turkic language and who call Xinjiang home - ever to have broken through and made it to a top national-level job in Beijing.
He had been in Moscow on Tuesday attending an official event on China-Russia investment, according to China's state planner.
Xinjiang has been one of China's most violent regions, with hundreds killed in unrest between the minority Uighurs and the majority Han Chinese in recent years.
Nur Bekri was Xinjiang's governor from 2008 until 2014, a time that saw bouts of ethnic violence that included deadly rioting in the region's capital, Urumqi, in 2009.
'EXTREMIST IDEOLOGY'
During his time in that position, which ranks below the Communist Party secretary, Nur Bekri was a proponent of restrictions placed on religious practices of the largely Muslim ethnic minorities there, ostensibly to curb what the government said was the spread of extremist ideology.
He said in the wake of the 2009 riots the government's religious policies completely accorded with the interests of the people.
Nur Bekri had also touted bilingual education for Uighurs in schools as a route to economic opportunity, although critics said in reality that meant marginalizing the Uighurs' own language and culture in favor of Mandarin.
Ilham Tohti, a Uighur economics professor and outspoken critic of Beijing's policies towards his people, was jailed for life on separatism charges in 2014, a sentence that caused an outcry from human rights advocates. Nur Bekri called the evidence against him irrefutable before he was jailed.
Dilxat Raxit, spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress, a Munich-based advocacy group, said in an emailed statement that despite actively promoting Beijing's policies, Nur Bekri had not been trusted by Beijing and was seen as ""scum"" by Uighurs.
""I hope that Nur Bekri's problems will awaken those Uighurs who are currently assisting Beijing's repression. They will not be able to gain real political trust from Beijing,"" he said.
Nur Bekri's tenure as governor ended under then party secretary Zhang Chunxian, who was replaced as Xinjiang's chief by Chen Quanguo in 2016.
Chen dramatically ramped up police presence and mass surveillance on minorities and ushered in the use of mass detention centers that have sparked a growing international outcry in recent months.
China denies the abuses and says the ""vocational""-style training centers, thought to hold potentially a million Uighurs and other Muslims, were designed to prevent extremism. 

Calls are growing from Western countries for action on the camps and U.S. officials have said they were considering sanctions on Chinese officials and companies linked to the crackdown.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's President Tran Dai Quang, a former chief of internal security who became one of the most high-profile leaders in the communist-ruled country, died on Friday after an illness, state media said.
Quang's rise, at a time of growing dissent on social media and challenges to the party's authority, signaled limits to Vietnam's liberal agenda, despite a growing openness to social change and sweeping economic reform, experts say.
Quang, 61, died in a military hospital in Hanoi of a ""serious illness despite efforts by domestic and international doctors and professors,"" Vietnam Television said.
He had hosted a reception for China's Supreme Court chief on Wednesday, state-owned newspaper Vietnam News said.
Quang had been ill for months, said former health minister Nguyen Quoc Trieu, who now oversees healthcare for high-ranking officials.
""He began showing symptoms of illness in June last year and has been treated in Japan six times since,"" Trieu told Reuters.
""He suffered from a kind of highly virulent virus, for which there has not been any efficient treatment.""
Vietnam has no paramount ruler and is officially led by four ""pillars"": its president, prime minister, the chief of its Communist Party and the national assembly chair. 
The president has a more ceremonial role, although he sits on the powerful decision-making politburo.
Before his April 2016 appointment as president, Quang had been minister of public security, heading an organization with broad powers responsible for intelligence gathering and thwarting domestic and foreign threats to the party.
ILLNESS RUMORS
Posts about the death of Quang, once tipped by some analysts as a potential general secretary, spread quickly on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) before state media took the rare step of announcing it within two hours of the event.
Rumors of his illness had circulated on social media for months, and there was no significant reaction in Vietnam's benchmark index.
At one of Quang's last appearances, during a visit to Hanoi by Indonesian President Joko Widodo on September 11, the president appeared visibly unwell and stumbled as he stepped on to a platform to inspect a guard of honor.
Quang hailed from a small farming community 115 km (70 miles) south of Hanoi, rising through party ranks to become a police general and Politburo member.
""We are saddened to hear the news that the president has died,"" said Bui Duc Phi, council chairman of the village where he was born.
Vietnam's constitution provides for the vice president to perform the president's duties should he be unable to work.
""Vice president Dang Thi Ngoc Thinh will handle his duties until the National Assembly elects a new president,"" said prominent lawyer Tran Vu Hai.

The national assembly is set to meet in late October, but the date could be brought forward, he added.

The ARD DeutschlandTrend survey put support for Merkel's conservative alliance - her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian allies, the Christian Social Union (CSU) - at 28 percent, down one point from Sept. 6 and at a record low.
Merkel, who has led Germany since 2005, only narrowly averted the collapse of her coalition government in June after a row between the CDU and the CSU over immigration policy.
The conservative sister parties and their Social Democrat junior coalition partners agreed to oust the head of the BfV domestic agency over accusations that he harbored sympathies to the far-right.
But the decision to give Hans-Georg Maassen a deputy minister position at the interior ministry was derided as a bad compromise that allowed the ruling parties to paper over deep differences that make their coalition unworkable.
The anti-immigration AfD, which has backed Maassen and said his removal would threaten national security, gained two points in the ARD DeutschlandTrend survey, conducted by pollster Infratest Dimap, to a record high of 18 percent.
This made it the second-largest party, ahead of the SPD, which fell to 17 percent.
A separate survey from INSA showed that almost half of Germans were in favor of a new election, reflecting discontent with the handling of the Maassen affair that has eroded Merkel's authority. Almost a third were against a new vote. 
In last September's federal election, the CDU/CSU bloc won 32.9 percent of the vote and the AfD surged into the national parliament for the first time with 12.6 percent, making it the third-largest party. The SPD came second with 20.5 percent.

Infratest Dimap polled 1,035 voters across Germany from Monday to Wednesday of this week.

The government has to set growth, deficit and debt targets for next year's budget by Sept. 27.
A slowing economy is making the government's task harder.
The economy ministry sees growth at 1.2 percent this year, compared to an April forecast of 1.5 percent, and at 0.9 percent next year, calculated on the basis of current legislation, compared with 1.4 percent previously, sources close to the matter told Reuters on Thursday.[nR1N1UG01Y]
Italy, like all other euro zone countries, will have to submit its draft budget for next year by mid-October. The Commission could reject it if it decides it is out of line with rules, a power the EU executive has so far never used.

But markets have been unnerved by the debate, with Italian bond yields widening and falling according to the tone of daily comments from the ruling parties, which took power in June.

EU leaders abruptly cautioned May on Thursday that unless she gave ground on trade and the Irish border by November they are ready to cope with Britain crashing out.
""At the moment what the European Union is asking in and around Northern Ireland is simply impossible for any UK government to accept. And actually if they stick with that position, there will be no deal,"" Grayling said.

Beijing has faced an outcry from activists, scholars, foreign governments and U.N. human rights experts over mass detentions and strict surveillance of the mostly Muslim Uighur minority and other Muslim groups that call Xinjiang home.
China says Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists and has rejected all accusations of mistreatment. Hundreds of people have been killed in Xinjiang in recent years in unrest between the Uighurs and members of the ethnic Han Chinese majority.
Officials say they are putting some people through ""vocational"" style courses to prevent militancy spreading.
After a three-day inspection of the region, Public Security Minister Guo Shengkun said that social stability in Xinjiang had been hard-won and ""should be greatly cherished and continuously consolidated"", the official People's Daily said. 
""We should comprehensively adopt political education, psychological counseling and vocational training, innovate and strengthen reform through education work for prisoners, and make efforts to make them turn over a new leaf,"" Guo said.
France and Germany on Wednesday added to growing calls for the United Nations to pressure China to close a system of extra-legal ""re-education camps"" where up to one million Uighurs and other Muslims are thought to be held for political indoctrination.
The security crackdown has also involved a spike in arrests and imprisonment, regular police searches and checkpoints, and growing interference in the daily religious practices of Muslims in the region, according to Human Rights Watch.
More should be done by the Xinjiang police to promote the ""grid management service"" at the ground level in order to ""let the masses feel safer and that the services is right besides them, Guo said.
Officials should continue to visit the homes of minority families and to raise their understanding of Chinese culture, the Chinese Communist Party, and the ""great motherland"" so that ""we are truly held tightly together like the pips in a pomegranate"".
Rights groups and activists say that visits by cadres are often used as a way of checking up on households and to ensure that they are not breaking any restrictions banning certain religious clothing, practices or books.
Guo's inspection tour was made alongside Xinjiang Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, who is widely considered responsible for the security crackdown.

800,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 12:31AM ET</span>",North Korea's Kim wants another Trump summit to speed denuclearization: South Korea's Moon,"By Hyonhee Shin and Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's Kim Jong Un wants a second summit with U.S. President Donald Trump soon to hasten denuclearization, but a key goal is declaring an end this year to the 1950-53 Korean War, the South's President Moon Jae-in said on Thursday.
Moon said he and Kim spent most of a three-day summit discussing how to break an impasse and restart nuclear talks between Pyongyang and Washington, which are at odds over which should come first, denuclearization or ending the war. 
Kim, who recently proposed another summit with Trump after their unprecedented June talks in Singapore, said the North was willing to ""permanently dismantle"" key missile facilities in the presence of outside experts, and the Yongbyon main nuclear complex, if the United States took corresponding action.
The joint statement from the summit stipulates his commitment to a ""verifiable, irreversible dismantlement"" of the nuclear programs, and ending the war would be a first U.S. reciprocal step, Moon said. 
""Chairman Kim expressed his wish that he wanted to complete denuclearization quickly and focus on economic development,"" Moon told a news conference in Seoul, shortly after returning from the summit with Kim in Pyongyang.
""He hoped a second summit with Trump would take place in the near future, in order to move the denuclearization process along quickly.""
INSPECTIONS
Moon said Kim was also open to inspection of a nuclear test site in the northwest town of Punggye-ri, which he called the North's sole existing facility for underground detonations. 
While Pyongyang has stopped nuclear and missile tests this year, it failed to keep its pledge to allow international inspections of its dismantling of the Punggye-ri site in May, stirring criticism that the move could be reversed.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday he had invited North Korea's foreign minister to meet in New York next week and other Pyongyang officials to Vienna for talks with nuclear envoy Stephen Biegun.
Asked on Thursday if those meetings would take place, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said invitations had been sent and added: ""We certainly stand ready to meet if they are able to."" 
Nauert said Washington looked forward to a formal readout of the North-South talks in meetings with the South Koreans next week, which will include one between Trump and Moon on Monday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.
Asked about Pompeo's statement on Wednesday welcoming plans for the dismantlement of all facilities at Yongbyon in the presence of U.S. and IAEA inspectors, Nauert said Moon and Kim had talked about inspectors.
""Having IAEA inspectors and United States inspectors be a part of anything is really just a shared understanding,"" she said. 
""Any time you have a nuclear situation like this where there is a dismantlement, the expectation is that the IAEA would be part of that, so that would be just the normal course of doing business. We have that shared understanding with the countries.""
Asked why this detail was not in the document signed by Moon and Kim, Nauert replied: ""We have had conversations ... with the government of North Korea and that is our mutual understanding; that is also the understanding between (South) Korea and North Korea. That was one of the things discussed, according to my understanding of it, over the past few days.""
Nauert did not respond when asked if the United States was willing to take ""corresponding measures,"" except to say: ""Nothing can happen in the absence of denuclearization; denuclearization has to come first.""
The North Korean ambassador to the United Nations, Kim Song, did not reply when asked by reporters on Thursday if his foreign minister would meet Pompeo on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly next week. 
ENDING WAR
Kim pledged to work toward the ""complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula"" during two meetings with Moon and his encounter with Trump, but follow-up negotiations on how to implement the vague commitments have since faltered.
Washington calls for concrete action, such as a full disclosure of North Korea's nuclear and missile facilities, before satisfying Pyongyang's key demands, including an official end to the war and the easing of international sanctions. 
The war ended in an armistice, rather than a peace treaty, meaning U.S.-led United Nations forces, including South Korea, are technically still at war with the North. 
But there have been concerns in South Korea and the United States that ending the war would ultimately prompt China and Russia, if not North Korea, to demand that the United Nations Command (UNC), which overlaps with U.S. forces in South Korea, be disbanded and leave.
Seoul aims to jointly announce with the United States an end to the war within this year, a measure Moon said he would discuss with Trump when they meet next week at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. 
An end-of-war declaration would not affect the presence of U.S. troops and the UNC in the South, Moon said, adding that Kim shared his view. 
""It would be a political declaration that would mark a starting point for peace negotiations,"" Moon said.

""A peace treaty would be sealed, as well as normalization of North Korea-U.S. relations, after the North achieves complete denuclearization.""

801,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 21, 2018 12:31AM ET</span>","U.S. sanctions China for buying Russian fighter jets, missiles","By Lesley Wroughton and Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration imposed sanctions on the Chinese military on Thursday for buying fighter jets and missile systems from Russia, in breach of a sweeping U.S. sanctions law punishing Moscow for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.
The U.S. State Department said it would immediately impose sanctions on China's Equipment Development Department (EDD), the branch of the Chinese military responsible for weapons and equipment, and its director, Li Shangfu, for engaging in ""significant transactions"" with Rosoboronexport, Russia's main arms exporter.
The sanctions are related to China's purchase of 10 SU-35 combat aircraft in 2017 and S-400 surface-to-air missile system-related equipment in 2018, the State Department said.
They block the Chinese agency, and Li, from applying for export licenses and participating in the U.S. financial system.
It also adds them to the Treasury Department's list of specially designated individuals with whom Americans are barred from doing business.
The administration also blacklisted an additional 33 people and entities associated with the Russian military and intelligence, adding them to a list under the 2017 law, known as the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA.
CAATSA also seeks to punish Russia for its aggression in Ukraine and involvement in Syria's civil war.
Doing significant business with anyone on that list can trigger sanctions like those imposed on China. 
Some of those added to the list, which now contains 72 names, were indicted in connection with Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, the official said.
Earlier on Thursday, President Donald Trump issued an executive order intended to facilitate implementation of the sanctions.
A federal special counsel is leading a criminal investigation of Russian interference in the U.S. election, and any possible cooperation with Trump's presidential campaign.
Trump has insisted there was no collusion with Russia. Moscow denies any effort to meddle in U.S. politics. 
AIMED AT MOSCOW - OR BEIJING?
One U.S. administration official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said the sanctions imposed on the Chinese agency were aimed at Moscow, not Beijing or its military, despite an escalating trade war between the United States and China.
""The ultimate target of these sanctions is Russia. CAATSA sanctions in this context are not intended to undermine the defense capabilities of any particular country,"" the official told reporters on a conference call. 
""They are instead aimed at imposing costs upon Russia in response to its malign activities,"" the official said. 
In Moscow, Russian member of parliament Franz Klintsevich said the sanctions would not affect the S-400 and SU-35 contracts.
""I am sure that these contracts will be executed in line with the schedule,"" Klintsevich was quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. ""The possession of this military equipment is very important for China.""
Security analysts in Asia said the move appeared to be largely symbolic and would serve only to push Moscow and Beijing closer together.
""The imposition of U.S. sanctions will have zero impact on Russian arms sales to China,"" said Ian Storey, of Singapore's ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute.
""Both countries are opposed to what they see as U.S. bullying and these kind of actions will just push Beijing and Moscow even closer together,"" he said, adding that Moscow needed Chinese money and Beijing wanted advanced military technology.
Collin Koh, a security analyst at Singapore's S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said the sanctions would do little to counter the evolving research and development relationship between China and Russia.
China relied less on large big-ticket purchases from Russia as in previous years, but Chinese defense industries were seeking expertise from Russia and former-Soviet states to plug knowledge gaps, he said.
The measures come as the Trump administration pursues a variety of strategies to clamp down on China and faces growing pressure to respond strongly to U.S. intelligence agency reports that Russia is continuing to meddle in U.S. politics.
Members of Congress, including many of Trump's fellow Republicans, who passed the sanctions bill nearly unanimously, have repeatedly called on the administration to take a harder line against Moscow.
Administration officials said they hoped the action against EDD would send a message to others considering buying the S-400.
U.S. officials have been discussing the issue particularly with NATO ally Turkey, which wants to buy the Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile batteries.
Washington has expressed concern that Turkey's planned deployment of the S-400s could pose a risk to the security of some U.S.-made weapons and other technology used by Turkey, including the F-35 fighter jet.
U.S. officials have warned that Turkey's purchase of the system could contravene CAATSA.

""We hope that at least this step will send a signal of our seriousness and perhaps encourage others to think twice about their own engagement with the Russian defense and intelligence sectors,"" another U.S. official said.

SANTO DOMINGO (Reuters) - China's most senior envoy arrived in the Dominican Republic on Thursday to inaugurate a new embassy after the country cut ties with Taiwan, as the U.S. ambassador there urged countries to make diplomatic decisions based on long-term goals.
The United States and China have been increasingly jostling for influence in Central America and the Caribbean during the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. 
Earlier this month, the United States recalled its top diplomats in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Panama over those countries' decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan.
In her first public appearance back in the Dominican Republic, U.S. Ambassador Robin Bernstein said on Thursday that the fact that she had been recalled to Washington ""demonstrates that the United States government takes the situation of its neighbors seriously.""
While Bernstein did not specifically mention Taiwan, she noted she had been asked about China's role in the region during her trip. 
""We respect the sovereignty of these countries, but we hope that they make their decisions based on long term goals,"" she said. 
Meanwhile, the Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, arrived in the Dominican Republic on Thursday as part of a trip to speak at the U.N. general assembly in New York. He will inaugurate the Chinese embassy in the Dominican Republic on Friday before heading to Guayama and Suriname. 
Central America and the Caribbean have long supported self-ruled Taiwan, which China views as a wayward province. But in August, El Salvador cut ties with the island, following the Dominican Republic and Panama, a sign of China's growing influence.

Corker, a Republican but also a frequent critic of U.S. President Donald Trump, is the highest-ranking U.S. official that Diaz-Canel has met since succeeding Raul Castro as president in April. He is due to retire from the Senate later this year.
Relations between the old Cold War foes have deteriorated over the past year due to Trump's hostile stance on the Communist-run island and what the United States has called a spate of ""health attacks"" on its diplomats in Havana.
Cuba denies any involvement and government officials have said they believe there were never any attacks, which they described as a pretext to justify conflict.
Diaz-Canel was expected to travel to the United States for the United Nations General Assembly next week but said in an interview broadcast on Sunday he could not talk with Trump as long as his administration kept its ""abnormal"" attitude toward the island.
The Trump administration has tightened the trade and travel embargo on Cuba and sharply reduced embassy staffing in Havana from more than 50 to a maximum 18.

Bolsonaro had a slight fever, the Albert Einstein hospital said in a statement, prompting doctors to order a scan. It showed an accumulation of liquid next to his intestine that was successfully drained.
A sample will now be analyzed to see if Bolsonaro is suffering from an infection, two doctors with knowledge of the procedure told Reuters on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.
A brief video of Bolsonaro walking back from the procedure accompanied by a nurse was posted on his Twitter account to show supporters he was recovering, although he was not expected to resume campaigning before the Oct. 7 election.
""Wait for me, folks, at the first-round vote,"" the former army captain said into the camera with a smile.
Bolsonaro gained ground over his rivals for the first round ballot despite being in hospital, according to a Datafolha poll published earlier on Thursday, widening his lead by two points to 28 percent. His closest adversary, Fernando Haddad of the leftist Workers Party, had 16 percent.
However, the election was expected to go to a second-round runoff on Oct. 28 in which the poll showed he was tied at 41 percent with Haddad, who replaced jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva last week on the Workers Party ticket.
Bolsonaro surged ahead in Brazil's most uncertain election in a generation by vowing to sweep away political corruption, crack down on rising violent crime and ease gun controls to allow Brazilians to buy guns to defend themselves.
His son sent a positive message after the procedure.

""They tried to destroy our family but all they have done is strengthen us. The captain is returning,"" Flavio Bolsonaro said in a Twitter message.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A lawyer for the woman accusing Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's U.S. Supreme Court nominee, of sexual assault told a Senate panel on Thursday she would not testify on Monday as Republicans want but would be willing to appear sometime next week if certain terms were met.
Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University in California, has been given a Friday deadline by the Republican-led Judiciary Committee to decide whether to testify at a high-stakes hearing it has scheduled for Monday.
Ford's lawyers talked to Judiciary Committee staff on Thursday night, a committee spokesman said without giving details.
A person familiar with the call said Ford could not testify until next Thursday. Politico, citing an unnamed source, said Ford's lawyers wanted Kavanaugh to appear first. It said the telephone discussion ended with no decision.
The lawyers said Ford was opposed to being questioned by outside counsel, according to Politico. CNN said the lawyers told the committee staff that she wanted to be questioned by senators. 
Ford's lawyer Debra Katz said earlier in an email to committee staff that Ford would be willing to testify under ""terms that are fair and which ensure her safety"" after she had received death threats.
If Ford agrees to appear, it would set the stage for a potentially explosive hearing just weeks before congressional elections that will decide the balance of power in Congress, against a backdrop of the #MeToo movement fighting sexual harassment and assault.
Kavanaugh, the conservative federal appeals court judge nominated by Trump in July for the lifetime job as a Supreme Court justice, also has been invited to testify on Monday.
Kavanaugh said in a letter to Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley on Thursday that he ""will be there"" on Monday. The Senate must confirm Supreme Court nominees.
Ford has said Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in 1982 when both were high school students in Maryland, an allegation Kavanaugh has called ""completely false.""
""As you are aware, she has been receiving death threats, which have been reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and she and her family have been forced out of their home. She wishes to testify, provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety,"" Katz wrote to the committee.
""A hearing on Monday is not possible and the Committee's insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event,"" Katz added.
A senior White House official said Kavanaugh and his wife also had received threats.
Grassley, a Republican, sent a letter on Wednesday to Ford's lawyers giving her until 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) on Friday to submit prepared testimony if she intended to show up on Monday.
Ford's lawyers had said on Tuesday she would testify only if the FBI first investigated her allegation. The FBI has said it is not investigating, a decision backed by Republicans who have accused Democrats of trying to delay the confirmation process.
In the Thursday email, Katz said Ford's ""strong preference continues to be for the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow for a full investigation prior to her testimony.""
CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS
The confirmation fight has unfolded ahead of Nov. 6 congressional elections in which Democrats are seeking to take control of Congress from Trump's fellow Republicans. Kavanaugh's confirmation would solidify conservative control of the Supreme Court and further Trump's goal of moving the high court and the broader federal judiciary to the right.
The Senate is narrowly controlled by Republicans, who have embraced the idea of a quick vote on Kavanaugh's nomination if Ford does not to testify.
U.S. Capitol Police said 56 protesters were arrested in Senate office buildings during demonstrations against Kavanaugh.
Groups of protesters, most of them women, clogged the lobby of Grassley's Senate office on Thursday and targeted other Republican lawmakers. Many wore buttons stating: ""I believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.""
Ford came forward with the allegation in an interview published in the Washington Post on Sunday. She accused Kavanaugh of attacking her and trying to remove her clothing while he was drunk at a party when he was 17 years old and she was 15.
Democrats, already opposed to Kavanaugh even before Ford made her allegation, accused Republicans of trying to railroad the nomination through the Senate.
""They are totally intent on getting Judge Kavanaugh onto the Supreme Court, come hell or high water,"" said Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono, who touted a letter of support for Ford signed by more than 1,000 women who graduated from the Maryland school Ford attended in the 1980s.
Responding on Twitter to Democratic criticism, the Judiciary Committee defended Grassley's approach and described how its staff members had contacted four people alleged to have been present at the house where the alleged incident occurred.
One of the four has yet to be publicly identified. Two others have said they have no recollection of any incident like the one Ford described.
Twelve of Ford's family members wrote an open letter, posted on Twitter by her niece, actress and singer Bridgit Mendler, calling Ford ""highly ethical"" and saying ""her honesty is above reproach.""
""We believe that Chrissy has acted bravely by voicing her experience from the past, and we know how difficult this is for her. Chrissy is not someone who chooses to be in the spotlight,"" the letter said.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's divisive campaign for next month's presidential election has spilled over onto sacred ground - the country's soccer pitches - an arena where political statements have been rare in recent years. 
Opinion polls show the presidential election is shaping up to be a two-horse race between the far-right Jair Bolsonaro and the leftist Workers Party candidate Fernando Haddad.
Bolsonaro, who is currently in hospital after being stabbed while on the campaign trail, leads the polls with around 28 per cent, nine points clear of Haddad, with the other candidates trailing. 
If none win a majority on Oct. 7 a run-off will be held three weeks later.
Bolsonaro has won support in recent weeks from a handful of top footballers, most controversially Palmeiras' club midfielder Felipe Melo.
Melo last week on national TV dedicated a match-winning goal ""to our future president Bolsonaro.""
Melo, who goes by the nickname Pitbull and is famous for his tempestuous behavior both on and off the field, was backed up by Tottenham Hotspur's Brazil winger Lucas Moura, as well as players from the Corinthians and Internacional teams.
Their support for Bolsonaro, a man who has threatened to execute political rivals and told a fellow congresswoman she is too ugly to rape, provoked celebration and condemnation in equal measure and spread to Brazil's powerful organised football fan groups.
One of the biggest, a group of more than 100,000 members who support Palmeiras' rivals Corinthians, told members this week a vote for Bolsonaro is not in keeping with the principles of a club famous for its working-class roots.
""Those of you who support a guy who goes against our ideals and throws our past rights' struggles in the garbage, please, if you want to keep supporting this guy, rethink your path inside our group,"" its leader Rodrigo Gonzalez Tapia wrote in an open letter published on Wednesday.
Backing from Corinthians players was particularly jarring for a club that was home to Corinthians Democracy, one the most extraordinary player power movements in sporting history.
The sudden involvement of players like Melo is welcome because all sport is political, said Juca Kfouri one of Brazil's best-known sports columnists. 
The surprise is that in a country renowned for its footballing left-wingers, the only ones now taking a political stance are on the right.

""If we criticised players in the past for not looking further than their own belly buttons, we can't criticise them now for speaking out,"" Kfouri said. ""But what we are hearing now is not enlightenment, it's ignorance.""

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro said on Thursday that 34 supermarket managers had been jailed on charges of hiding food and gouging prices, in the leftist government's latest crackdown on businesses as the country struggles under a severe economic downturn.
""We had a group of supermarkets that hid the products from people and started to charge them whatever they wanted. There are 34 managers of big supermarkets behind bars for violating the law,"" Maduro said, often angry during an hour-long televised broadcast on state television.
""I say one thing and the supermarkets come along and say another... What excuse do they have to not follow the rules?"" said Maduro, urging Venezuelans to speak up if they see unfair prices to avoid ""getting robbed."" 
Last month, Maduro vowed an economic renewal for the oil-rich country, which is suffering from hyperinflation and shortages of basic goods, ordering a 60-fold salary hike and devaluing the currency by 96 percent. 
His cash-strapped government said it would cover salaries for the first three months so that businesses would not increase prices despite the opposition-led congress estimating annual inflation at 200,000 percent. 
Local media have reported that many of the arrested managers worked at Central Madeirense, a chain founded some 70 years ago by Portuguese immigrants. The company and Venezuela's Information Ministry did not respond to requests for comment. 
Some shop owners, doubtful that the government would ever cover the new wages, tried to balance the books by hiking prices and firing employees, adding to a mass exodus that has already seen over 2 million people flee the country of 30 million. 
Economists say Maduro's reforms do not tackle Venezuela's root problems, namely currency controls and excessive money creation, and could in fact further destabilize its economy. 
But Maduro struck an upbeat tone as he reviewed the measures, saying wage increases had been smooth and that authorities were no longer printing money unsustainably. 
Maduro also said Venezuela would in October start using the petro, a cryptocurrency it launched this year, in international trade. A recent Reuters special report, however, showed that the petro is not a functional financial instrument, suggesting Caracas will struggle to get it accepted abroad.
A new system to pay for Venezuela’s gas will be extended nationwide on Monday, Maduro said. Venezuelans will be able to use a controversial state-issued ""fatherland card"" to fill their tanks, Maduro added, promising further details next week.

Maduro also blasted banks, giving them 48 hours to ""free"" the cash they were hoarding. Venezuela has struggled to print enough physical money, creating chronic cash shortages that Maduro has blamed on businesses and ""mafias"" operating in neighboring Colombia.

(Reuters) - A woman armed with a handgun opened fire on Thursday on co-workers at a Maryland distribution center for the Rite Aid drugstore chain, killing three people and wounding three others before taking her own life, the Harford County sheriff said.
The shooting unfolded shortly after the suspect, a temporary employee there, reported for work around 9 a.m. EDT at the warehouse in Perryman, Maryland, about 34 miles (55 km) northeast of Baltimore, Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler said at a news conference.
The sheriff said investigators had not yet determined a motive, but a law enforcement source told Reuters the shooting was believed to have been sparked by a work-related grievance.
The sheriff's office later identified the killer as Snochia Moseley, 26, a resident of Baltimore County. The fact that the assailant was a woman was unusual given that the overwhelming majority of mass shootings in the United States are committed by men.
Gahler said Thursday's gun violence began outside the warehouse and then moved inside, but investigators were still piecing together the precise sequence of events.
He said seven people were hit by gunfire and that four, including the woman who opened fire, were killed. The three others were expected to survive, according to the sheriff.
He said the suspect, who was armed with a 9mm Glock pistol and two or three magazines of ammunition, shot herself in the head, and that no shots were fired by law enforcement.
Investigators believe all the victims were fellow Rite Aid employees, but it was not immediately clear whether any were specifically targeted by the suspect, Gahler said.
The Rite Aid center, part of a larger warehouse in an industrial park, has nearly 1,000 employees, company spokesman Pete Strella said. The facility packages pharmaceuticals and other products for delivery to more than 2,500 stores.
Police spent several hours searching the 210,000-square-foot (19,510-square-metre) building for possible additional victims, the sheriff's office said.
""Our prayers are with all those impacted, including our first responders,"" Governor Larry Hogan wrote on Twitter. ""The State stands ready to offer any support.""
Agents from the Baltimore offices of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the FBI also responded, the agencies said.
The shooting occurred a day after a man shot and wounded four people, including a police officer, at a Pennsylvania court building before he was killed by police, according to Pennsylvania State Police.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's first bullet train glides out of a sleek harborfront railway station bound for mainland China on Saturday, launching a new era of integration and raising fears for some for the territory's cherished freedoms. 
Unlike other cross-border connections, the $11 billion train project has stoked considerable controversy, with Hong Kong, a former British colony, having had to concede part of its jurisdiction to China for the first time. 
Passengers entering the modernist building will have their documents stamped by Chinese immigration officers and will be subject to Chinese law while zipping across Hong Kong at 200 kph (120 mph) to the mainland. Hong Kong and Beijing officials have justified the unusual arrangement as a one-off, while touting its logistical and economic benefits. 
But critics say the railway is a symbol of continuing Chinese assimilation of Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with guarantees of widespread autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent legal system. 
""I worry that Hong Kong will no longer be Hong Kong,"" said Martin Lee, a veteran democrat and barrister who is fighting to derail the project in the city's courts. 
He said Hong Kong risked losing its allure as a financial hub underpinned by strong rule of law, as Beijing steps up a push to fuse the city into a vast hinterland of the Pearl River Delta including nine Chinese cities dubbed the Greater Bay Area. 
Several other infrastructure projects will open this year including a $20 billion sea bridge to Macau and Zhuhai, while Beijing is now working with Chinese tech giant Tencent to let people replace their travel documents by using a mobile phone WeChat app to cross the border in future. 
""LITTLE ANT IN A BOX"" 
""Hong Kong will be completely submerged into the Greater Bay, and we don't know what it's going to be like,"" said the 80-year-old Lee, who helped found the city's Democratic Party.
""That's the worrying thing. Hong Kong is going to be put like a little ant into a box."" 
In recent years, especially since mass pro-democracy protests in 2014 that ended with no concessions from the government, Beijing has struggled to win hearts and minds, especially among those youths who reject any notion of being part of mainland China and have chafed at perceived meddling in Hong Kong's affairs. 
As protesters demanded greater freedoms amid some talk of splitting Hong Kong from China, Beijing tightened its grip, jailing some young protest leaders, forcing others to flee and taking the wind out of the democracy movement's sails. 
Hong Kong officials dismissed concerns that Hong Kong's identity was being swamped. 
""In such a closely knitted hinterland, there is always a wish to bring down any sort of unnecessary barriers,"" Hong Kong Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development Edward Yau told Reuters. 
""But that's not to say compromising on one country, two systems,"" Yau added, referring to the formula by which Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule with the promise that its ""capitalist system and way of life"" would remain unchanged until at least 2047. 
""The bottom line will still be one country, two systems,"" Yau added. ""The Basic Law (Hong Kong's mini-constitution) does not have an expiry date of 2047."" 
Bernard Chan, who runs an insurance business and sits on Hong Kong's Executive Council which advises the government on policy, said he believes China wants to make Hong Kong work in its best interests. 
The high speed rail and bridge will bolster existing infrastructure that already allows more than 600,000 people to shuttle between the two sides daily by road, rail and sea.
Beijing wants the Greater Bay Area, home to some 68 million people with a combined GDP of $1.5 trillion, roughly that of Australia or South Korea, to model itself on San Francisco Bay and Tokyo Bay, to better meld people, goods and sectors including finance, tourism, logistics, manufacturing and tech. 

""The truth of the matter is, of course, we are integrating fast, economically and socially,"" said Chan. ""The one part that is not integrating at all is politics.""

BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Britain's anti-European Union UK Independence Party (UKIP) launched a set of populist policies on Friday hoping to revive their dwindling political influence and capitalize on outrage over the government's handling of Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May is struggling to sell her plan for a Brexit that would continue to see Britain abide by many EU rules. Growing unrest among pro-Brexit groups could scupper her leadership and thrust Britain into political crisis. 
UKIP played a defining role in recent British history as the force that pressured former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron to call a referendum on leaving the EU, and then stoked the anti-establishment uprising behind the 2016 'leave' vote. 
But, since finding itself on the winning side of the Brexit vote UKIP has struggled to influence the exit process, seeing its voter support evaporate and undergoing two years of inner turmoil to find a leader to replace the talismanic Nigel Farage.
On Friday, current leader Gerard Batten published a manifesto document that sought to rediscover the everyman appeal that once made the party a threat to larger rivals from across the British political spectrum. 
""These policies are aimed at helping the people who form the backbone of Britain: ordinary workers and taxpayers, the unemployed who would like to work, and small and medium-sized business owners,"" Batten, a member of the European Parliament, said in a statement launching the 17-page manifesto. 
""Its purpose is to make UKIP a populist party in the real meaning of the word - one whose policies are popular with voters.""
The policies included a ""complete and total"" withdrawal from the EU, arguing that Britain should end all payments to the EU and adherence to the bloc's rules - a much more radical break than May is proposing.
Batten has been criticized, including by some former UKIP members, for engaging with causes championed by far-right groups, and he has described Islam as a ""death cult"". 
Other policies, much of which are similar to previous UKIP positions, include selective and limited immigration, scrapping overseas aid, lower domestic taxes and a tougher approach to taxing multinational companies.
UKIP currently has no elected representatives in parliament and it gathered only 600,000 votes in a 2017 general election, compared to 3.8 million in 2015 - a fall from more than 12 percent of the total vote to less than 2 percent. 

Nevertheless, in many marginal seats it has the power to influence which major party can win and, with no party clearly ahead in opinion polls, has the potential to affect the outcome of any future national election. Although an election is not scheduled until 2022, May's government remains fragile.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in cleared a top item off his bucket list on Thursday: Climbing Mount Paektu in North Korea with its leader Kim Jong Un. 
After the two leaders pledged new steps aimed at salvaging nuclear talks on Wednesday, Moon and Kim decided to use the final day of their three-day summit to go up the symbolic mountain on the Chinese border together.
Moon is known for his love of mountain climbing and has trekked in the Himalayas at least twice. 
The president has long stated that visiting Mount Paektu, which can also be spelled Baekdu in the South and is known as Changbai in China, was a ""long unfulfilled dream"".
""Many people in the South would go to Mount Paektu from the China side, but I decided not to, pledging myself that I would go stepping on our soil,"" Moon told Kim after reaching the peak of the mountain. 
""But time flew so fast, and I thought my wish may not come true, but it did today.""
As Moon arrived at an airport near the mountain, some 1,000 North Koreans greeted him, waving flowers and chanting ""Motherland! Unification!"" 
Moon and Kim took a cable car together to Heaven Lake, a caldera at the top of the mountain, and walked around the area with their wives and officials from both sides. 
Pictures showed Moon and Kim smiling and posing with their wives, and Moon filling a bottle with water from the lake. 
""The Chinese envy us because they can't go down to the lake from their side but we can,"" Kim said. 
""We should write another chapter of history between the North and the South by reflecting our new history on this Heaven Lake.""
Some senior South Korean officials accompanying Moon suggested inviting Kim and his wife to Mount Halla, the highest mountain and a scenic tourist resort in the South. 
""There is our old saying that we greet the sun at Paektu, and greet the unification at Halla,"" Kim's wife, Ri Sol Ju, said.
Kim said on Wednesday he will visit Seoul in the near future, in what would be the first trip to the southern capital by a North Korean leader. 
'SACRED MOUNTAIN OF REVOLUTION'
As the highest peak on the Korean peninsula at about 2,750 meters (9,000 ft), Mount Paektu is the mythical origin of the Korean people, featured in South Korea's national anthem and various North Korean propaganda. 
An active volcano, the mountain is dotted with secret camps and historical sites from Korea's guerrilla war against the occupying Japanese in the 1930-40s, in which Kim's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, played a leading role.
North Korea says Kim's grandfather and father, Kim Jong Il, were born at Mount Paektu, a centerpiece of the North's idolization and propaganda campaign to highlight the sacred bloodline of the ruling Kim family.
A copy of an article of the North's official newspaper Rodong Sinmun dated Dec. 26, 1980 calls Mount Paektu a ""sacred mountain of revolution"" spearheaded by Kim Il Sung ""in the flames of the arduous 20-year anti-Japan struggle.""
""State media and ideological indoctrination was setting the stage"" for Kim Jong Il's power succession that took place in 1980, said Michael Madden, a North Korea leadership expert at the Stimson Centre's 38 North in Washington. 
Kim Jong Un, too, has visited the mountain around major developments in North Korea, such as before he executed top officials including his uncle Jang Song-thaek in late 2013, and following North Korea's fifth nuclear test in 2016. 
He last went there in December, after declaring North Korea had completed its goal of becoming a nuclear state, according to state media. 
""(Moon) would add much legitimacy to Kim, who had never had any summit with a foreign leader until early this year,"" said Seo Yu-suk, a research manager at the Institute of North Korean Studies in Seoul. ""It's a diplomatic coup for him."" 

Moon's parents fled the North during the 1950-53 Korean War, shortly before Moon was born in South Korea in 1953.

SALZBURG, Austria (Reuters) - European Union leaders will push for a Brexit deal next month but warned Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday that if she will not give ground on trade and the Irish border by November they are ready to cope with Britain crashing out.
""Don't worry, be happy,"" joked EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker after telling reporters after a summit in Austria that the Europeans had full plans in place in the event there was no deal before Britain leaves next March.
May promised new proposals to reassure Dublin that it would not get a ""hard border"" with the British province of Northern Ireland but warned she too could live with a no-deal outcome -- though many round the summit table in picturesque Salzburg see that as more of a negotiating tactic than a credible threat.
She said her ""Chequers"" proposals for trade with the EU, intended also to resolve arguments over the borders of Northern Ireland, were the only way forward. EU leaders repeated their view the plans would undermine their cherished single market.
But leaders also tried to put a positive spin on their 24 hours of talks. Summit chair Donald Tusk said he was more optimistic about getting agreements both to ease Britain out gently and to sketch out a future free trade pact. 
Tusk said a Brussels summit on Oct. 18 would be a ""moment of truth"" to overcome remaining big problems and leaders penciled in the weekend of Nov. 17-18 to formalize a final agreement.
But May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were among those who stressed there was still ""a lot of work"" to do. 
May faces a fight with angry Conservatives at her party's conference in 10 days. They deride her willingness to bind Britain into much EU regulation in return for free trade; some would prefer a no-deal ""hard Brexit"" in March, despite warnings that would ravage the British economy.
EU leaders understand that she can give little away before the conference ends on Oct. 3. But they hope their negotiator, Michel Barnier, can secure her agreement next month to what will be new EU proposals. These will be fundamentally unchanged but may be politically more palatable, notably on Northern Ireland.
""Ritual dance is always a part of such negotiations,"" a senior adviser to one of May's summit peers told Reuters. 
""It may be that they will just accept what we have proposed after the Tory conference.""
MERKEL, MACRON SKEPTICAL
Whether it can be done by mid-November, many doubt. Brussels is familiar with the theater of diplomacy, where being seen to hold out to the bitter end can help sell the unpopular back home and some diplomats believe a deal could take until Christmas.
Any later, and there would be a risk of failing to get it ratified by both parliaments before Brexit Day on March 29.
""It was clear today that we need substantial progress by October and that we then aim to finalize everything in November,"" Merkel said. ""But there is still a lot of work to do on the question of how future trade relations will look.""
""You can't belong to the single market if you are not part of the single market, but you can develop a lot of creativity to find practical, good, close solutions.""
French President Emmanuel Macron rammed home the message: ""It was a good and brave step by the prime minister,"" he said of her trade plan. ""But we all agreed on this today, the proposals in their current state are not acceptable.
""The Chequers plan cannot be 'take it or leave it'.""
The EU also insists on a ""backstop"" clause in any withdrawal treaty. This would keep Northern Ireland under EU economic oversight if London and Brussels cannot agree a trade pact to keep UK-EU borders open after a transition period ends in 2020 -- an idea that May and a small party in the province that props up her minority government oppose.
""We need to ensure that nothing is done which effectively carves Northern Ireland away from the rest of the United Kingdom,"" May told reporters after Tusk had briefed her on the discussions the other 27 had on Brexit over lunch.

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said there was no chance the EU would compromise on its demands and rejected speculation the other countries would be tempted to fudge the Irish issue until later. But he also said he thought there would be a deal.

President Muhammadu Buhari, who won the 2015 election on an anti-corruption ticket, ordered government revenues to be placed in a Treasury Single Account (TSA) at the central bank as part of an anti-corruption drive. Money recovered from alleged graft would also be put in the account. 
The police on Thursday said they had launched a nationwide exercise to recover stolen funds, to be placed in the TSA, during which it discovered money related to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation's (NNPC) Liquefied Natural Gas business unit.
Police recovered ""$470,519,889.10 belonging to NNPC Brass/LNG Investment hidden in some commercial banks after the directives of the federal government on TSA,"" police spokesman Jimoh Moshood said in an emailed statement. 
Moshood, who said the recovery followed an investigation by specialist police units, did not state when the money was recovered. 
A spokesman for NNPC did not immediately respond to phone calls and text messages requesting comment. 
Buhari plans to seek a second term in a presidential elections scheduled to take place in February 2019. 
Nigeria, Africa's top crude oil producer and which has one of the continent's largest economies, in early 2017 emerged from its first recession in 25 years, which was largely caused by low oil prices.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan pop star turned opposition politician Robert Kyagulanyi pledged on Thursday to continue what he calls a fight for freedom for millions of oppressed fellow citizens, after returning to his country from the United States.
The return of the 36-year-old musician, known by his stage name of Bobi Wine, has rattled the government headed by 74-year-old President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power since 1986 and leads a nation where nearly 80 percent of the population is below the age of 30. 
Though a political novice -- he was elected in a parliamentary by-election last year -- Kyagulanyi's popularity has skyrocketed particularly among disillusioned youths who say they see few prospects under the rule of Museveni.
When Kyagulanyi arrived at Entebbe International Airport from the United States, police escorted him into a vehicle and whisked him to the capital Kampala where his whereabouts were for a time unknown, leading supporters for a while to fear he had been arrested. 
He had received medical treatment in the United States for injuries which he said were sustained during torture by security forces last month. The government has denied any mistreatment but says it is investigating.
But Kyagulanyi later appeared atop a car outside his home in Kampala to address hundreds of cheering supporters.
""I am resuming immediately ... I am on the mission already, I am on the fight for freedom and liberty already,"" he said, surrounded by throngs of people.
Leaning on a cane, he said his ""desire for liberty"" was as strong as ""the desire of the millions and millions of people in Uganda to be free."" Ugandans, he said, were ""slaves in our own country"".
His supporters had earlier in the day defied a heavy security presence and gathered at his residence to welcome him, but once he arrived by police escort, security forces did not attempt to stop crowds from gathering at his home. 
Many of his supporters wore red t-shirts and hats. The color has come to be associated with his ""People Power"" movement, and demonstrators at Ugandan embassies in London, Nairobi and elsewhere have donned the same color during protests.
Police had on Wednesday banned rallies to welcome Kyagulanyi home and said they would escort him to his home. The legal basis for the escort was unclear.
Ahead of Kyagulanyi's arrival, security forces had deployed around the airport and the highway linking it to Kampala to prevent supporters from greeting him. Armored personnel carriers and police vehicles lined the route and journalists were prevented from traveling to the airport to cover the arrival.
Kyagulanyi is increasingly seen as posing a significant challenge to Museveni, who has ruled since 1986. 
His message - that young Ugandans need a dynamic new head of state to tackle the myriad problems they face - has electrified citizens who say they are fed up with corruption, unemployment, and state repression of dissent. 
The government denies allegations of corruption and of stifling opposition.
Museveni has won praise in the West for his support against militant Islam and his role as power-broker in the volatile Great Lakes Region. Uganda has also welcomed foreign investors such as France’s Total, China’s CNOOC and Britain’s Tullow as part of a plan to start pumping oil from 2021.
But the government is facing growing criticism from its allies, particularly main donors the United States and the European Union, who have deplored the torture alleged by opposition politicians including Kyagulanyi. 
Kyagulanyi attracted a youth following through songs critical of Museveni and his status rose higher due to an incident in August in which his driver was shot dead and he was detained and charged with treason over what authorities said was the stoning of the president's convoy.

The politician, who has pleaded not guilty to the treason charges, said he was beaten with an iron bar in detention in northern Uganda. The government denies that he was mistreated.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Thousands gathered in Barcelona on Thursday to mark the first anniversary of a police raid on Catalan government offices in the Mediterranean city, a move that sparked a huge demonstration ahead of a banned vote on a split from Spain.
Streets in downtown Barcelona were filled with banners showing pro-independence jailed politicians and civil right activists.
The raid and subsequent protests stoked a febrile atmosphere that saw Spanish police wielding batons and firing rubber bullets at crowds attempting to vote in the referendum on Oct. 1 - images that flashed around the world.
During the Sept. 20 protests, Spanish police were trapped inside a Barcelona building and their vehicles were destroyed as anger among those favouring independence boiled over.
The Spanish police were trying to halt the referendum.
The rally was attended by current regional leader, Quim Torra, and Catalan parliament speaker, Roger Torrent.
Both demanded the release of some jailed Catalan leaders and to push ahead with the independence drive.
People chanted pro-independence slogans in Catalan, shouting: ""Llibertat presos politics"" (""freedom for political prisoners"").
After the vote on Oct. 1, Catalonia made a declaration of independence that led to Madrid taking over the regional administration. 
Since then, pro-independence forces have returned to power in the regional parliament. Polls show those wanting secession and those preferring to stay part of Spain roughly evenly split, leading to a deep divide in Catalan society.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's former Brexit minister David Davis has said up to 40 lawmakers from Prime Minister Theresa May's party will vote against her plans to leave the European Union, meaning she may struggle to get her deal through parliament. 
The United Kingdom is due to leave the EU on March 29 but little is clear. There is so far no full exit agreement and some rebels in May's Conservative Party have threatened to vote down a deal if she clinches one.
Davis told Huffington Post there was a ""rock-solid"" core of party lawmakers who belonged to the European Research Group (ERG), a grouping which wants a sharper break with the EU and were willing to vote down her plans. 
The three largest opposition parties, Labour, the Scottish National Party and Liberal Democrats, have all publicly said they will oppose the prime minister's plans.
If 40 of May’s 315 lawmakers and the opposition parties voted against a Brexit deal based on her proposals, she would fall short of the number needed to pass the legislation. 
This would increase the likelihood that Britain would face leaving the EU without an agreement and of a general election or even a second referendum.
""Every group in any political party has differences, egos and so on,"" Davis said.
""But with Labour voting against, the critical size of the voting bloc is quite small, it’s basically a dozen people. The rock-solid core of the ERG is a multiple of that. I’m not even an ERG member. It’s probably 30, 40.”
Under May’s proposals, Britain will seek a free trade area for goods with the EU, largely by accepting a “common rulebook” for goods and British participation in EU agencies that provide authorizations for goods.
Some Brexiteers say those proposals would ensure the EU kept control over swathes of the British economy, and thus run counter to the spirit of her manifesto pledge to leave the EU Customs Union and the Single Market.

When asked who would benefit politically if Brexit supporters felt betrayed, Davis said: ""Anybody who wants to play the populist card that the elites have let you down. Populist something, whether it’s far right or far left.""

DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - At least 42 people drowned when a ferry sank on Thursday in Tanzania's Lake Victoria and government officials feared the final death toll could be more than 200, a senior local official said.
Ukerewe District Commissioner Colonel Lucas Magembe told Reuters that the rescue mission to find survivors from the disaster had been halted until dawn on Friday with 42 people confirmed dead.

But it was hard to establish the precise number of passengers on board since the person dispensing tickets had also drowned with the machine recording the data lost.

820,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",Italy's government allies seek higher deficit to spur growth,"By Giselda Vagnoni
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's ruling parties want to spur economic growth by setting next year's budget deficit target at more than two percent of annual output, a level that clashes with European Union commitments and may boost the country's mammoth debt.
Earlier this month, Economy Minister Giovanni Tria reassured the European Commission he would stick to goals that would improve public finances, including cutting Italy's structural deficit, which is adjusted for economic cycles and one-off spending or income, and lowering debt.
But Tria, an academic and member of neither ruling party, is locked in a tug-of-war with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League, who want major spending on their flagship campaign promises amid flagging growth. 
""I think we can even breach the 2 percent level on condition we do it not to fund demagogic measures but to put the country on a growth path,"" Cabinet Undersecretary Giancarlo Giorgetti, a prominent member of the League, said in a television interview on Wednesday night.
To improve the structural deficit even slightly, Italy's headline deficit probably needs to stay between 1.5 and 1.7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), EU officials and economists have estimated. 
Italy's public debt, at about 132 percent of GDP, is the highest in the EU after Greece. 
Tria wants to keep the 2019 budget deficit at 1.6 percent of GDP, according to a government source, while sources from the 5-Star and League have told Reuters they want it as high as 2.5 percent and not below 2 percent.
Tria stuck with his prudent line on Thursday, telling parliament he would ""ensure a gradual implementation of our economic policies, which are compatible with the need to guarantee the equilibrium of our structural budget"".
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, another former academic who is close to 5-Star but is not a member of either party, told reporters at an EU meeting in Austria that the budget ""must send a message we are keeping public accounts in order.""
Neither Conte nor Tria gave a figure for next year's deficit target.
SLOWING GROWTH
Tria has to set growth, deficit and debt targets for next year's budget by Sept. 27. A slowing economy is making the government's task harder.
The economy ministry sees growth at 1.2 percent this year, compared to an April forecast of 1.5 percent, and at 0.9 percent next year, calculated on the basis of current legislation, compared with 1.4 percent previously, sources close to the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
Italy, like all other euro zone countries, will have to submit its draft budget for next year by mid-October. The Commission could reject it if it decides it is out of line with rules, a power the EU executive has so far never used.
But markets have been unnerved by the debate, with Italian bond yields widening and falling according to the tone of daily comments from the ruling parties, which took power in June. 
Yields have trended down in recent weeks due to confidence that Tria will keep a lid on the deficit, but they jumped on Thursday after 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio seemed to hint his party may even quit the government over the budget.
""If we don't find the resources (to fund promised measures) it's better to go home. It's useless to just chug along,"" Di Maio said in a radio interview.
Di Maio later issued a statement saying his words were not intended as a threat, and the government was fully united in its determination to keep its policy pledges.

The League's Giorgetti followed up with a statement saying the two parties would govern together for a full 5-year term, ""fulfilling our government contract point by point.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Aided by fellow Republicans in the Senate, President Donald Trump is rapidly filling vacancies on U.S. appeals courts, moving some that had liberal majorities closer to conservative control in an ideological shift that could benefit his administration.
These 13 courts wield considerable power, usually providing the last word on rulings appealed from lower courts on disputes involving federal law.
Their rulings can be challenged before the U.S. Supreme Court, but most such appeals are turned away because the top court typically hears fewer than 100 cases annually. Eleven of the courts handle cases from specific multi-state regions, one handles cases from Washington, D.C., while another specializes in patent cases.
Presidents can reshape the federal judiciary with their appointments and seek to appoint judges they believe share their ideological leanings. Republicans typically strive to pick conservatives while Democrats generally aim to appoint liberals, all subject to Senate confirmation. 
Although there are no guarantees a judge will rule the way a president might like, the number of Republican and Democratic appointees is generally an indicator of an appeals court's conservative-liberal balance. 
With the Republican-led Senate rapidly considering and confirming many of his judicial nominees, Trump already has appointed 26 appeals court judges. That is more than any other president in the first two years of a presidency, according to Russell Wheeler, a scholar at the Brookings Institution think tank, although he points out that there are more appellate judges now than in the past.
Trump's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, appointed 55 in eight years as president. 
Only four of the 13 federal appeals courts currently have more Republican-appointed judges than Democratic selections.
(For a graphic showing Trump's impact on federal appeals courts, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2PPsGtM)
The two appellate courts closest to shifting to Republican-appointed majorities are the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Trump already has made three appointments to the 11th Circuit, leaving it with a 6-6 split between Democratic and Republican appointees. The 3rd Circuit, to which Trump has made one appointment, now has a 7-5 Democratic-appointee majority, with two vacancies for Trump to fill.
Should further vacancies open up on those courts, Trump's appointees would tip the ideological balance.
The ideological ""flipping"" of a judicial circuit, where cases typically are decided by panels of three judges, can have a direct impact on how cases are decided and new legal precedents established. Cases before circuit courts span a wide range of issues, from hot-button topics such as abortion, gay rights and the death penalty to voting rights, regulatory and business disputes, employment law and the environment.
Trump pledged as a candidate in 2016 to appoint conservatives to the bench. So far, he has largely kept his promise.
Many of Trump's judicial nominees have close ties to the Federalist Society conservative legal group, which organizes networking events and conferences for lawyers and law students.
INHERITED VACANCIES
Trump inherited a large number of vacancies, in part because the Senate - controlled by Republicans since 2015 - refused to act on some of Obama's nominees.
There are currently 13 appeals court vacancies, six of them with pending nominees picked by Trump, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.
Both the 11th Circuit and 3rd Circuit have major cases pending in which Trump appointees could make their mark. 
An 11th Circuit three-judge panel on July 25 revived a civil rights lawsuit challenging the state of Alabama's move to prevent the city of Birmingham from increasing the minimum wage. Alabama has asked for a rehearing, which would be heard by the entire 12-judge 11th Circuit if the request is granted. 
In the 3rd Circuit, the Trump administration has appealed a lower court decision blocking the Justice Department from cutting off grants to Philadelphia over so-called sanctuary city policies limiting local cooperation with federal authorities on immigration enforcement.
When Obama took office in 2009 after Republican President George W. Bush's eight years in office, the courts were tilted heavily toward Republican appointees, with only one having a majority of Democratic appointees. When Obama left office in 2017 after his own two four-year terms, nine of the 13 regional courts had majority Democratic-appointees. 
Leonard Leo, who took leave from his role as executive vice president of the Federalist Society to advise the White House on judicial nominations, said there is ""tremendous desirability to flipping circuits that are majority liberal activists."" But Leo said that ""every White House is subject to the vagaries of when a judge decides to retire."" 
Flipping courts that have solid Democratic-appointee majorities will be difficult for Trump. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has seven vacancies and Trump has already filled one. Even if Trump fills all of them, Democratic-appointees would still hold a 16-13 majority. 
Trump and conservative allies have criticized the 9th Circuit for high-profile rulings against his administration including over the legality of the president's ban on people entering the United States from certain Muslim-majority countries. The Supreme Court, with its conservative majority restored by Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch last year, in June upheld the travel ban policy.
A circuit court vacancy is created when a judge takes a form of semi-retirement known as ""senior status.""

""You have to have a wave of Democratic-appointed judges taking senior status for Trump to have any hope of flipping the 9th Circuit,"" University of Pittsburgh School of Law professor Arthur Hellman said.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday called on the Myanmar government to pardon and release two imprisoned Reuters journalists as soon as possible.
""It is not acceptable to have the journalists of Reuters being in jail for what they were doing,” Guterres told reporters at the United Nations in response to a question about Aung San Suu Kyi’s recent remarks on the case. 
""It is my deep belief that that should not happen and I hope that the government will be able to provide a pardon to release them as quickly as possible.”
Reuters reporters Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were convicted on Sept. 3 under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act in a case seen as a test of democratic freedoms in Myanmar.
The reporters, who pleaded not guilty, said they were handed rolled papers by police shortly before they were detained last December, and a police witness testified in court that they had been set up.
The reporters had been investigating the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys by security forces and local Buddhists amid a military response to insurgent attacks last August.
Suu Kyi said at a forum in Hanoi last week the case had nothing to do with freedom of expression. She said the reporters had been sentenced for handling official secrets and ""were not jailed because they were journalists.""
Earlier on Thursday, the British foreign minister, Jeremy Hunt, said on a visit to Myanmar that he was ""extremely concerned"" about the case of two Reuters journalists. He said he raised specific concerns with Suu Kyi about the conviction and asked her to consider giving them a pardon.
""She indicated that the judicial processes would probably need to be concluded before that could be considered, but I did put that squarely on the table as something I hoped she would consider,"" Hunt said.
""This is a critical moment for Burma as one of the newest democracies in the world to show that its court system is effective and there is due process, and I think there are a number of grounds for concern that that didn't happen in this case.""
Hunt told Reuters he pressed Suu Kyi on the importance of holding the armed forces accountable for any atrocities, adding that if that did not happen within the country, other options should be considered, including referral to the International Criminal Court.

Some 700,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar into Bangladesh from the military crackdown, which U.N.-mandated investigators said last month was launched by senior Myanmar generals with ""genocidal intent.""

The six-week operation also seized more than 20 tonnes of the trinkets stored in depots outside the capital. Police units involved in combating illegal immigration helped conduct the raids, the Paris prefecture said in a statement.
Migrants can often be seen selling the souvenirs near the Eiffel Tower and at other sites popular with tourists, including Montmartre and around Notre Dame cathedral.
""The operation led to the seizure of 20 tonnes of the trinkets stashed in boxes in Val-de-Marne and Hauts-de-Seine, as well as 15,000 euros in cash, several money-counting machines, coins and three delivery vans,"" the police said.
The street value of the merchandise was estimated at 600,000 euros ($700,000). The smallest ones are usually sold on key-rings for as little as one euro for five copies, while larger versions can sell for as much as 10 euros a piece.
Ten people were detained for questioning, police said.

In some cases, migrants are press-ganged into selling the trinkets to pay off the debts they owe to traffickers after being smuggled into Europe from Africa. Police have said previously that many of the souvenirs are made in China.

Bad weather in Mexico City, which is in its rainy season, temporarily closed the airport on Wednesday, creating chaos and delay for hundreds of passengers.
The president-elect, who won a landslide victory in July, has vowed to run an austere government. He has promised to turn the presidential palace into a cultural center, and sell the presidential plane. 
""I'm not going to change my mind because of this, I won't get on the presidential plane,"" Lopez Obrador said while stuck on the commercial jet, videos on local media showed. 
Local media reported that Lopez Obrador's flight from the beach resort of Huatulco on the Pacific coast was delayed by around four hours, including three with the passengers already on board.
Construction of a new $13 billion airport for Mexico City to replace the current one, which is often crowded and has no room to expand, is underway. But Lopez Obrador has been skeptical of the project and his team have proposed an alternative plan to build two new runways at a military airbase near the capital and maintain the current airport.
There will be a public consultation in October on the project's future.

Alaa and Gamal Mubarak, along with seven other men, are accused of violating stock market and central bank rules to make unlawful profits through dealing in shares of Al Watany Bank of Egypt in 2007.
They deny any wrongdoing. The Mubarak brothers and three of the accused were detained on Saturday while four others of the group remained at large. 
The Cairo Criminal Court on Thursday released the five who had been detained on 100,000 Egyptian pounds ($5,570) bail each and set a new hearing for Nov. 20, a witness in the court said.
Analysts have cited the arrests last week as being partly behind negative sentiments that led to a steep drop in the stock market on Sunday.
Among those detained were Yasser El Mallawany and Hassan Heikal, current and former board members respectively at Egyptian investment bank EFG-Hermes. 
Mubarak’s eldest son, Alaa, is a businessman. Gamal, a former banker, was widely viewed as being groomed for Egypt’s top job until Hosni Mubarak was forced to step down in February 2011.

The pair were detained after Egypt's 2011 uprising but had been free since 2015.

Abdulkarim Omar, joint head of foreign relations in the Kurdish-led area, told journalists its administration was holding around 500 foreign fighters and 500 family members from around 40 countries, following last year's defeat of Islamic State in nearly all territory it once held in Syria and Iraq.
""For us it is a very large number because these Daeshis are dangerous and they committed massacres, and their presence in our detention is an opportunity for the international community to put them on trial,"" Omar said, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State members. 
Backed by the United States and its allies, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia alliance captured swathes of northern and eastern Syria from Islamic State over the past two years, including the jihadists' one-time capital Raqqa. 
The SDF is now fighting to take the last few villages Islamic State holds along the Euphrates River in Syria, close to the border with Iraq, and has detained more foreign fighters, Omar said.
Omar said the administration in the area lacked the resources to properly rehabilitate so many prisoners. It would put Syrians on trial, but not foreigners, and it would not execute anyone as it did not impose the death penalty.
""We will try on the path of dialogue... to hand them over to their countries, but if our hope is cut, we will have other options,"" he said. He declined to explain what he meant by ""other options"" apart from no longer detaining the prisoners.
Omar was speaking at a news conference in Qamishli near the Turkish border to announce that Sudan was taking back a captured Sudanese woman who had joined Islamic State. 
She was one of only 50 or 60 people taken back by their countries so far, including women and children, Omar said. He said Russia and Indonesia had each taken back families.
The continued presence of foreign fighters in an unstable part of the world posed a danger to the whole international community, because they might take advantage of any new period of chaos to escape, Omar said. 

""We alone cannot bear this burden,"" he said. ""This problem is no less dangerous than that of the Daesh state.""

828,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 11:54AM ET</span>",From Congo to Greece's basketball league: a migrant boy's journey,"By Karolina Tagaris 
THESSALONIKI, Greece (Reuters) - He fled hardship and unrest in Congo Republic with nothing but his ball and a change of clothes. Now, not yet 18, Christ Wamba is training with a professional basketball club in Europe.
Taking a well-trodden route north out of sub-Saharan Africa, Wamba clung on to his treasured ball until he had to jettison it on the sea crossing from Turkey to Greece. He is now under the wing of one the country's biggest clubs, Aris, as he waits for his asylum application to be processed.
""I didn't have shoes to play basket,"" Wamba, a towering figure with boyish looks and bleached hair, said of life in Congo, a nation rife with poverty despite its oil wealth.
""I played with flip-flops. Sometimes with nothing, without shoes, with only my legs, with blood sometimes,"" he said, cradling a ball between legs that are almost too long for the bed in the room provided by a U.N. refugee agency scheme.
When Wamba, 17, arrived in Greece in March 2016, his prospects, like thousands of asylum-seekers languishing on Greece's islands, were dim. 
Then technology changed his luck.
After months on Lesbos, he created a profile on Athlenda, a start-up described by its founder Lazaros Papadopoulos, a former Greece national team player, as ""LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) for athletes,"" bringing together players, coaches, clubs and scouts. 
He was quickly spotted by Aris, the Thessaloniki-based team of Greek basketball great Nick Galis, a Hall of Famer.
""I liked him from the first moment because I saw his passion. And when I see talent, a kid trying to do whatever it takes to play, I couldn't not be moved,"" said Papadopoulos, who mentors Wamba. ""He's got all the specs to succeed.""
OPPORTUNITY 
In Africa, where soccer is king, Wamba was too tall to play. He bought his first basketball with food money and taught himself by watching NBA videos and trying to emulate his idols, Kevin Durant and Kobe Bryant.
""We didn't have food to eat but I don't care. When I didn't have food I prefer to (pass) my time in the court,"" he said. 
He fled in 2015 when protests and violence broke out in the capital Brazzaville over a contested referendum by long-serving President Denis Sassou Nguesso to lift limits to his term.
He was jailed for days and feared for his safety, he said. Dozens of activists remain in prison, Amnesty International said in March.
Wamba traveled to Turkey, where he spent months scrabbling together the money to pay a smuggler for the treacherous dinghy journey to Greece.
""It was night. We didn't know the way. We spent four hours in the sea ... The water was so cold in March. You can't move. If you move people (say) 'hey, you want people to die?'""
Eventually, they were rescued by the Greek coast guard. Wearing a puffer jacket, a track suit and a beanie hat, Wamba was taken to Greece's biggest migrant camp, Moria, according to Reuters journalists who saw him arrive.
There, he skipped meals to practice for seven hours a day. Often, he ran some 20 km to find a basketball court, he said.
Since June, the 6'7"" (2-metre) player - whose full name is Christ Wamba Bouassou Joachim Mossai Fidele - trains in Aris's yellow jersey as shooting guard and forward. Without legal status in Greece, he's banned from playing.
""He's very cooperative, he's a great kid and he deserves this opportunity. We're happy to have him,"" Aris coach Vangelis Angelou said. The team is even considering taking him on as a foreign player, he said.
Back in his tiny room, Wamba dreams of joining the NBA one day.
""I try to be the best. Maybe one day in the future they will talk also about me,"" he said.

829,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 11:42AM ET</span>",Turkish court orders release of jailed opposition lawmaker: Anadolu,"ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish court ordered the release of a jailed opposition lawmaker on Thursday who had been sentenced to more than five years for disclosing government secrets, the state-run Anadolu news agency said.
Enis Berberoglu was the first lawmaker from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) to be jailed amid government purges following a failed military coup in 2016.
Berberoglu was initially sentenced in June 2017, to 25 years for espionage on charges that he gave an opposition newspaper a video purporting to show Turkey's intelligence agency trucking weapons into Syria. He denied the charges.
In a retrial in February, Berberoglu's jail sentence was cut to five years and 10 months in jail. [nL8N1Q31RH] In Turkey's snap parliamentary election in June, Berberoglu was re-elected to parliament from behind bars.
Turkey's court of appeals ruled on Thursday that Berberoglu's sentence should be suspended and it freed him for the remainder of his term as a CHP lawmaker, Anadolu said.
The court of appeals was not immediately available for comment.
The opposition Cumhuriyet daily published its original report about the alleged weapons shipment to Syria based on a video that allegedly came from Berberoglu. 
Two of the newspaper's journalists, Can Dundar and Erdem Gul, were sentenced to at least five years in jail over the report, but were later released pending an appeal process.
Dundar, who for critics of President Tayyip Erdogan's post-coup security clampdown has become a symbol of press freedom, has since left Turkey and is now being tried in absentia. Gul remains in the country and free while his appeal is in process.
More than 50,000 people have been detained and more than 150,000 have been sacked or suspended from their jobs since the abortive coup in July 2016. Around 150 media outlets have also been shut down, while 160 journalists have been jailed.

In April, a Turkish court sentenced 14 staff of Cumhuriyet to prison on terrorism charges and acquitted three, in a case that sparked global outrage over press freedom under Erdogan.

The letter written by a senior official in the ministry covering health and gender issues asked the head of FHI 360, a U.S.-based non-governmental organization, to immediately stop airing advertisements under a project called Tulonge Afya (Let's speak health). 
""The ministry intends to revise the contents of all your ongoing radio and TV spots for family planning, thus I request you to stop with immediate effect airing and publishing any family planning contents in any media channels until further notice,"" the letter, dated Sept. 19, said.
A source at the health ministry who did not wish to be named confirmed the letter's authenticity.
On September 9, Magufuli expressed his doubts about family planning.
""If you cannot work then opt for family planning but if you can work hard why family planning?"" he said.
""Let me tell you in front of the minister of health who is always advocating for family planning, go to farm, work hard … if you have enough food then give birth as you can,"" he said during a tour in central Tanzania's Simiyu region. 
Magufuli, nicknamed 'The Bulldozer' for his forceful leadership style, has introduced anti-corruption measures and tough economic reforms since taking office in November 2015, including cuts to government spending and overhauling the fiscal and regulatory regime of the mining sector in Africa’s fourth-largest gold producer.
Critics say his cost-cutting measures and policy changes are excessive and undermine growth by stifling foreign investment in vital sectors such as mining.

Officials from FHI 360 and U.S. Aid Tanzania office did not immediately respond when Reuters sought comment.

SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced new limits on the ability of immigration judges to terminate deportation cases on Wednesday, the latest in a series of decisions to facilitate the removal of immigrants in the country illegally.
Unlike the federal judiciary system, U.S. immigration courts fall under the Department of Justice and the attorney general can rewrite opinions issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals. Sessions, a Republican former U.S. senator appointed by President Donald Trump, has been unusually active in this practice compared to his predecessors.
In his most recent decision, Sessions said judges can only terminate or dismiss cases in “specific and circumscribed” circumstances. Judges “have no inherent authority to terminate removal proceedings even though a particular case may pose sympathetic circumstances,” he said. 
The decision laid out specific circumstances under which immigration judges can terminate deportation proceedings, including in cases where the government cannot prove its case for removal. Judges can also terminate proceedings if the government asks for a dismissal or to allow an immigrant time for a final hearing on a pending petition for naturalization when the matter involves “exceptionally appealing or humanitarian factors.”   
Having a deportation case terminated does not confer legal status on an immigrant, but it does give them time to pursue other avenues of remaining in the country legally. The Department of Homeland Security can place immigrants whose cases are dismissed back into deportation proceedings with a new charging document.
“The decision is the next step in a concerted effort by the A.G. to undermine judicial independence and to minimize the role of judges in immigration court,” said Kate Voigt, associate director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers’ Association.
Dana Leigh Marks, president emeritus of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said the decision “shows again the amount of pressure being applied to judges to move cases forward toward removal as quickly as possible.”

The Department of Justice declined to comment.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Islamabad has invited Saudi Arabia to become the third partner in the Beijing-funded Belt and Road corridor of major infrastructure projects inside Pakistan, Pakistan's information minister said on Thursday.
The announcement comes on the back of a two-day trip to Saudi Arabia by new Prime Minister Imran Khan, who had been expected to push for financial assistance from Islamabad's ally to help Pakistan deal with a brewing currency crisis.
Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry did not reveal if Saudi Arabia would be loaning money to Pakistan to help top up its dwindling foreign currency reserves, but said he expected Saudi Arabia to invest in Pakistan in a major way.
""Saudi Arabia is the first country whom we have invited as third country partner in CPEC,"" Chaudhry said, referring to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the Pakistan leg of China's vast Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.
Beijing has pledged $60 billion to build power stations, major highways, new and upgraded railways and higher capacity ports, to help turn Pakistan into a major overland route linking western China to the world. 
Chaudhry said a Saudi delegation will be coming to Pakistan in the first week of October, including the Saudi minister for finance and energy, and that should lay down a ""foundation for a very big partnership"".
""God willing, very big investments will be coming to Pakistan from Saudi Arabia this way,"" he added.
Khan's term began with new doubt over the CPEC projects, when his commerce minister was quoted as saying Pakistan would suspend them for a year and review them. The minister later said his comments were taken out of context, and Pakistani officials reassured Beijing there would be no delay.
Pakistan has in the past suggested that other countries could join CPEC, but the response has been lukewarm due to concerns that China would dominate any relationship. 
Saudi Arabia has a history of bailing out Pakistan financially. In 2014, six months after Pakistan obtained its last IMF bailout, Saudi Arabia loaned it $1.5 billion that the government used to strengthen its rupee currency.

Ahead of Khan's visit to Saudi Arabia speculation was rife that Islamabad will be asking for a loan to help Pakistan avoid being forced to seek another IMF bailout.

Philip Hammond made his plea at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Vienna at the beginning of this month, according to an EU official with direct knowledge of the matter.
He called on the EU Commission to ""engage"" on preparing plans that could reduce or avoid disruption to the financial sector in case of a so-called hard Brexit. 
Hammond is most concerned that financial contracts could be rendered invalid by a hard Brexit.
Although he insisted that Britain was still committed to reaching a Brexit deal, he acknowledged the risks of there being no agreement before March.
No one was immediately available for comment at Britain's finance ministry.
The EU commissioner on financial services, Valdis Dombrovskis, said at that meeting that work was underway to address ""possible"" problems, according to the EU official. But he played down Hammond's concerns about the continuity of financial contracts, saying he expected limited problems.
The argument mirrored an earlier clash between the EU Commission and the Bank of England over contingency planning.
Brussels is saying it is up to supervisors and firms to adapt to Brexit.
The Bank of England has called this approach ""impractical"" and said 82 billion pounds ($109 billion) of insurance liabilities involving 48 million policyholders could be disrupted across Britain and the European Economic Area. 
Derivatives worth a notional 26 trillion pounds are also likely to be affected by Brexit.

U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of that nuclear accord - which curbed Iran's atomic activities in return for sanctions relief - in May, saying it did not go far enough.
The U.S. special envoy for Iran, Brian Hook, said on Wednesday that Washington now wanted to negotiate a treaty that included Tehran's ballistic missile program and its regional behavior. 
Hook said the new deal that Washington hoped to sign with Iran, would not be a ""personal agreement between two governments like the last one, we seek a treaty.""
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif took to Twitter to dismiss the characterization of last deal as a ""personal agreement"", saying it was ""an int'l accord enshrined in a UN (Security Council resolution)"".
""U.S. has violated its treaty obligations too... Apparently, U.S. only mocks calls for peace,"" he added in the message that was attached to a video of a protester who took to the stage after Hook's speech, shouting that sanctions were hurting Iranian people.

840,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Leading Asian cardinal calls for Vatican foreign minister to resign over China dealings,"By James Pomfret and Anne Marie Roantree
HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Hong Kong cardinal who has spearheaded opposition to the Vatican's rapprochement with China called on Thursday for the Pope's secretary of state to step down, saying any deal with Beijing would amount to a betrayal of the Catholic faith. 
The Vatican and China have been in advanced talks this year to forge what would be an historic breakthrough and precursor to a resumption in diplomatic relations after 70 years, with Secretary of State Pietro Parolin among the chief negotiators.
The Vatican may send a delegation to China before the end of this month. If the meeting goes well, the two could reach an agreement on the appointment of bishops, a Chinese state-run newspaper reported earlier this week.
Cardinal Joseph Zen, the most senior Catholic cleric on Chinese soil, said he believed the two sides were making a ""secret deal"", although he acknowledged he had no connection with the Vatican and was ""completely in the dark"". 
""They're giving the flock into the mouths of the wolves. It's an incredible betrayal,"" he said. 
He described Parolin, the highest ranking diplomat in the Vatican, as someone who despised heroes of faith. 
""He should resign,"" Zen told Reuters at his home on a wooded hillside on Hong Kong island.
""I don't think he has faith. He is just a good diplomat in a very secular, mundane meaning.""
Zen, who at times knocked his knuckles on the table to make a point, stopped short of calling on Pope Francis to step down, saying: ""I would not come out to fight the Holy Father, that is my bottom line.""
The Vatican did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Zen's remarks.
At a time when the Vatican is also under pressure for purportedly covering up a sex abuse scandal in the United States, with one archbishop even calling for the Pope to resign, Zen suggested this China deal would further add to the Church's vulnerability.
""The consequences will be tragic and long lasting, not only for the church in China but for the whole church because it damages the credibility. Maybe that's why they might keep the agreement secret.""
China's roughly 12 million Catholics are split between an underground Church that swears loyalty to the Vatican, and the state-supervised Catholic Patriotic Association.
The potential deal has divided communities of Catholics across China, some of whom fear greater suppression should the Vatican cede greater control to Beijing, but others want to see rapprochement.
Zen said he believed only half the underground church in China would accept a deal and was concerned how the remainder might react.
""I'm afraid they may do something irrational, they may make rebellion,"" said 86-year-old Zen, a former bishop of Hong Kong and the most outspoken critic of the Pope's China strategy. 
Pope Francis has rejected criticism that the Holy See may be selling out Catholics to Beijing's communist government. 
Zen said he believed any deal with atheist China would deal a significant blow to Pope Francis' credibility. 
""It's a complete surrender. It's a betrayal (of our faith). I have no other words, said Zen.

841,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 09:27AM ET</span>","Relief for UK pet owners: Serial cat killer does not exist, police say","LONDON (Reuters) - A feared serial cat killer who for three years was believed to have mutilated pets across London does not exist, and foxes or other wildlife were probably to blame, police said on Thursday.
Hundreds of suspected incidents were reported to police raising widespread concern that a single figure - dubbed the ""M25 Cat Killer"" or the ""Croydon Cat Killer"" after the capital's orbital motorway and the south London town where the mutilations were first recorded - was responsible.
But, police said that after a thorough examination of the evidence and investigation of corpses in six suspected cases, officers had found nothing to indicate human involvement.
""Officers working alongside experts have concluded that hundreds of reported cat mutilations in Croydon and elsewhere were not carried out by a human and are likely to be the result of predation or scavenging by wildlife,"" London police said.
The police investigation began in Nov. 2015 after reports from Croydon of mutilated cats missing their heads and tails. Many other distraught owners came forward with similar stories and British newspapers speculated that the cat killer might move on from animals to humans.
However, local animal charity, the South Norwood Animal Rescue League (SNARL) carried out 25 post-mortems on suspected victims which indicated the cause of death was blunt force trauma suggesting the cats were most likely run over by a vehicle and the mutilations occurred after death.
Closed circuit TV footage in three cases showed foxes carrying parts of the dead animal, including one which took a cat's head into a school playground in Catford, south London. Further tests on six cases that still appeared suspicious concluded the cats had also been victims of scavenging.

""Such apparent spates of cat mutilations are not unknown in the UK and elsewhere,"" the police statement said. ""Officers were aware of a spate of reported mutilations some 20 years ago which were eventually attributed to predation by wildlife.""

In a letter seen by Reuters, Cardinal Oswald Gracias, the president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India, said Pope Francis had received the bishop's request to be temporarily relieved of his pastoral responsibilities.
The Vatican had accepted the request, the letter said.
The nun from the southern Indian state of Kerala has accused Bishop Franco Mulakkal, who heads the Diocese of Jalandhar, of raping her repeatedly over a period of two years.
The bishop has not been charged, but has given interviews denying wrongdoing and saying he wanted to defend his name. He wrote to the Vatican on Sunday asking to step down temporarily as protests and calls for his arrest grew in the state.
""Having considered all circumstances, the Holy Father has accepted this request,"" the letter said.
The case comes at a time when the Christian community, which accounts for 19 percent of the state's population, is reeling under an erosion of trust as sexual abuse cases involving the clergy pile up.

The Catholic Church faces crises worldwide involving sexual abuse of minors by members of the clergy.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - A campaign to drive the Houthi movement from Yemen's main port of Hodeidah, which resumed this month after peace talks failed, will not be halted again until the city is captured, a Yemeni commander leading southern separatist forces said on Thursday.
Aidaroos al-Zubaidi is the leader of the separatists who aim to restore the independent state of Southern Yemen, which united with northern Yemen in 1990.
His Southern Resistance Movement has 20,000 men positioned in Hodeidah, providing the bulk of a ground force led by the United Arab Emirates that is trying to capture Yemen's main port city from the Houthis who control the capital Sanaa.
UAE-led troops launched a major offensive in Hodeidah in June this year but suspended it after several weeks to allow the possibility for U.N.-brokered peace talks. The campaign resumed this month after the Houthis failed to attend the talks.
On Wednesday, Zubaidi's Giants Brigade said it was reinforcing its lines in Hodeidah, sending more men, armored vehicles and heavy artillery. The escalation has raised international alarm because of the threat to civilians, both from fighting in the city and from potential disruption to supply lines that keep more than 8 million Yemenis from famine.
""The civilian lives are very precious and all the coalition's operations in the air and sea are taking into consideration the civilian casualties, but the military operation has begun and there will be no going back,"" Zubaidi told Reuters in an interview in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi.
""In all the wars across the world, there is always humanitarian suffering. But we are looking beyond the liberation of Hodeidah which will be in the interests of the city's population,"" said Zubaidi. ""The battle of Hodeidah is continuing and the war is not over.""
VICIOUS CIRCLE
Zubaidi's separatists have occasionally fought alongside forces of President Abd Rabbu Mansour al-Hadi, who was driven out of the capital in 2014 and now heads a government based in the southern port of Yemen.
They later fell out, but both remain important components of an anti-Houthi alliance backed by Arab forces led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Hadi lives in exile in Riyadh and has a close relationship to Saudi Arabia, while Zubaidi's separatist Southern Transitional Council maintains its luxurious headquarters in Abu Dhabi, the Emirati capital, and is backed by the UAE.
The separatist force, built with UAE support, has more than 50,000 fighters. They helped drive the Houthis from Aden and al Qaeda militants from the southern port of Mukalla in 2015, often acting in a shaky alliance with Hadi's troops.
Intervention by the Arab states has so far failed to break the Iran-aligned Houthis, who still control most of Yemen's populated areas and strategic cities. The anti-Houthi coalition says it has seized the road linking Hodeidah to Sanaa to isolate the two cities. The Houthis deny that the road has been taken.
Zubaidi characterized the fighting around Hodeidah as ""hit-and-run style with the enemy, and the resistance forces with all their factions have fought heroically.""
He dismissed suggestions that the aim of resuming the offensive was to put pressure on the U.N. envoy over the peace talks. He said he supported the talks but they should include the southern separatists because they control the ground.

""Talking to people who do not control the ground is like getting locked in a vicious circle,"" he said, adding that talks should lead to a referendum on self-determination for the south.

844,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>",Greek minister optimistic Macedonia name deal will be approved,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias on Thursday hailed an agreement with Macedonia on changing its name and opening the way for it to join NATO and the European Union.
""History should be a school and not a prison,"" Kotzias told reporters after a meeting with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas in Athens. ""This accord took us out of prison.""
Macedonians will vote on Sept. 30 on a deal reached with Athens in June that would change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia. 
Greece's northern neighbor currently calls itself the Republic of Macedonia but, because of the dispute with Greece, is provisionally recognized at the United Nations as the ""Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"". 
Athens had long objected to its use of the name Macedonia, arguing that it, along with contentious articles in the country's constitution, could imply territorial claims over Greece's own northern region named Macedonia.
Greece insisted on the name change in return for lifting its opposition to Skopje joining NATO and the EU, a row which has bedevilled the two states' relations for more than two decades. 
Both ministers on Thursday said the deal added to stability and security in the Balkans. 
""This is a historic opportunity,"" Maas said. ""I hope that this historic accord will be implemented."" 
NATO has invited Macedonia to begin accession talks with the alliance, but says it must first change its constitution.
Under the deal, the constitution must be amended to adopt the new name, and it must be used in all international organizations.
The two countries have also agreed that amendments will be made to the constitution to make clear Skopje's use of the terms ""Macedonia"" and ""Macedonian"" does not refer to ancient Greek civilization, or the history and culture of Greece's Macedonia region.
The EU has also said it will set a date for Macedonian accession talks pending implementation of the deal.
Kotzias said the Greek parliament would vote on the deal and on Macedonia's accession to NATO immediately after the constitutional changes are implemented, most likely in January. 
Greece's left-led governing coalition is backed by 153 lawmakers in the 300-seat parliament and opposition parties, including the conservatives, have vowed to vote against the agreement with Skopje. 
The leader of the ruling coalition's junior partner, the Independent Greeks party, has also said he will not back the government in a vote in parliament, fuelling fears of a snap election in a country which has only just emerged from its third international bailout.
Kotzias brushed off criticism, saying he was certain that if Skopje delivered the required constitutional changes, the deal would pass in parliament, with the backing of center-left and independent lawmakers. 

""We need a majority of lawmakers, not a majority of parties,"" Kotzias said. ""The majority (of lawmakers) for the approval of this deal is there.""

845,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 08:38AM ET</span>",French court orders Le Pen to submit to psychiatric evaluation,"PARIS (Reuters) - A French court ordered Marine Le Pen to submit to a psychiatric evaluation as part of its investigation into her decision to post images of Islamic State executions on Twitter, the far right leader said on Thursday and denounced the order.
The investigation is one of a series that have distracted Le Pen's National Rally, formerly known as the National Front, as it seeks to rebuild after her loss to President Emmanuel Macron in the second round of an election last year.
The investigation relates to three graphic images of Islamic State executions Le Pen posted on Twitter in 2015, including the beheading of American journalist James Foley.
The tribunal declined to confirm it had ordered the evaluation but said the assessments were a normal part of such probes.
""I thought I had seen it all: but no! For having denounced the horrors of #Daesh in tweets, the 'justice' is submitting me to a psychiatric evaluation! How far will they go?"" Le Pen wrote on Twitter. ""It's UNBELIEVABLE.""
She later told reporters she would skip the test. ""I'd like to see how the judge would try and force me do it,"" she said.
Le Pen's criticism fits the party's narrative that it is persecuted by judges as part of an attempt by the establishment to undermine it politically.
Le Pen was placed under formal investigation in March on suspicion of disseminating violent images. The law states that medical evaluations must be carried out in such probes.
Le Pen and her party have been targeted by a series of other judicial probes, including over the alleged misuse of EU funds.
According to a copy of the court document dated September 11, which Le Pen published on Twitter, the judge wants the evaluation to assess if she suffers from any mental illness and, if so, if that could have affected her understanding of what she was doing when she posted the tweets.
The expert is also tasked with determining whether her mental health could be a risk to the public. 
Le Pen's hard-left rival Jean-Luc Melenchon said the evaluation was unnecessary because Le Pen was ""politically responsible for her political acts."" 
""This is not how we will weaken the far-right,"" he said.

Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said in a statement: ""A court orders a psychiatric assessment for Marine Le Pen. Words fail me! Solidarity with her and with the French who love freedom!""

General Assembly this month, the Indian foreign ministry said on Thursday, the first such high-level meeting in years between the nuclear rivals and arch foes.
Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had written to his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, suggesting their foreign ministers meet in New York to try to break an impasse in ties.
With Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party 
gearing for elections by the middle of next year, prospects of a rapprochement are low. The BJP has long advocated a tough stance toward Pakistan.
The Modi government has insisted that Pakistan act against anti-India Islamist militant groups that operate from its soil before it can resume peace talks to resolve long standing differences over the Himalayan region of Kashmir and other disputes.
Pakistan denies aiding and abetting attacks in India including in Kashmir and says it is fighting militant groups for its own security.
Indian foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said New Delhi had agreed to a meeting between Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj and her Pakistani counterpart, Shah Mahmood Qureshi. 
He sought to play down hopes of a full resumption in talks between the neighbors that have been in deep chill ever since coordinated attacks in Mumbai in 2008 in which 166 people were killed by Pakistan-based militants.

Among the 96 people killed in the 2010 crash in Russia was Lech Kaczynski, then president of Poland, whose twin brother Jaroslaw leads Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party.
The European Court of Human Rights decided unanimously that ""there had been a violation of Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life) of the European Convention of Human Rights,"" the court's statement read.
Under the previous government of the centrist Civic Platform (PO), the Polish authorities concluded that the crash was an accident. A panel led by a prominent PiS politician suggested there might have been an explosion on board.
The issue has deeply divided Polish society. 
PiS was accused of exploiting the crash during its 2015 election campaign but has said it just wanted to get to the bottom of the tragedy. 
Polish prosecutors ordered the exhumation of the bodies, including Lech Kaczynski's, to check whether the fatalities had been caused by an explosion or impact with the ground. 
The wives of the two victims complained that they were given no opportunity to appeal the decision before the bodies were exhumed without consent.

SZEGED, Hungary (Reuters) - A Hungarian court sentenced a Syrian-Cypriot man to five years in prison on Thursday for crossing the border as part of a riot during the migrant crisis, in a case that has drawn criticism from the European Parliament and Amnesty International.
Ahmed Hamed was among a group of migrants that crossed into Hungary on Sept. 16, 2015 from Serbia, pelting policemen with rocks before hundreds of migrants forced open the border gate and police fired water cannon and teargas.
He was provisionally sentenced in March to seven years in jail for illegally crossing the border and for being an accomplice in what the court called a ""terrorist act"" during clashes with police at the border.
Thursday's final ruling in the case, which has drawn criticism of Hungary's hardline stance against Muslim immigration to Europe, relaxed the sentence to five. 
The court upheld the preliminary verdict that Hamed should be expelled from Hungary for 10 years.
Hamed's case featured in a report on the rule of law in Hungary, which culminated last week in an unprecedented decision by the European Parliament to sanction Hungary for flouting EU rules on democracy, civil rights and corruption.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban's tough stance against immigration has pitted Hungary against fellow European Union members Germany and France. As well as building a steel fence on its southern border, Hungary has toughened laws on immigration and clamped down on non-government organizations that Orban accuses of supporting illegal immigration.
Human rights group Amnesty International has said it believed the terrorism clause was unduly applied in Hamed's case by Hungarian authorities. On Tuesday, it submitted a petition to the Hungarian Justice Ministry calling for Hamed's release.
The court found that the terrorism clause was applicable as Hamed and others acted in concert to force the border open.
The final ruling relaxed the seven-year verdict issued in March as the court considered new mitigating circumstances in the case, Judge Erik Mezolaki told a courtroom packed with dozens of journalists.
""The objective of punishment is to deter either the accused or anyone else from committing a crime,"" Mezolaki said. ""Retribution does not fall under the scope of punishment."" 
The court considered the fact that Hamed does not speak Hungarian, and that he has been separated from his family, as mitigating circumstances, as well as the fact that he has been detained for more than three years, the judge said.
That means he is likely to serve two years in jail.

The European Parliament's report said the court ruling issued in March raised ""the issue of proper application of the laws against terrorism in Hungary, as well as the right to a fair trial.""

SOACHA, Colombia (Reuters) - Yeimy sobbed with her head in her hands as she described how her husband was tied to a pole, gagged and made to watch as she was raped by four fighters from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) 12 years ago.
Her husband, Elkin, had been abducted by the FARC's 45th Front in the Tolima region of central Colombia after refusing to pay a revolutionary tax or hand their six-year-old son to the Marxist rebels to become part of the armed group, Yeimy said. 
After trekking through the jungle for days to find the rebel camp, Yeimy pleaded for her husband's release but the FARC commander, known by the nom de guerre Pepito, demanded a terrible price, she said.
""He told me, 'I will pick four of my men and they can do what they want with you',"" said the 37-year-old, who asked that her family name not be used.
After securing a deal for the release of her husband, Yeimy fled with her family to Soacha, near Colombia's capital Bogota, which is home to tens of thousands displaced by the conflict. 
But two years later the rebels who had kidnapped Yeimy's husband found them, claiming the couple still owed FARC the so-called revolutionary tax. Yeimy said they took away her husband and shot him. 
Yeimy is one of hundreds of women who has come forward to talk to victims groups about their alleged sexual abuse during Colombia's five decades of civil war. After a 2016 peace deal with the FARC the government set up a Special Peace Tribunal (JEP) to try crimes committed by all sides in the conflict. 
Yeimy has started therapy sessions with a psychologist to overcome her fear so she can testify before a public defender, said Sonia Tarquino, who runs a victims program in Soacha. 
Reuters has not been able to verify Yeimy's account independently. FARC spokesman declined to comment on individual allegations of war crimes since the peace deal, saying these cases will be heard by the JEP. 
But last month, three victims associations delivered 2,000 documented cases of sexual abuse to the JEP. 
The tribunal's president, Patricia Linares, has said those responsible would not be allowed to escape justice, but would be eligible to receive non-jail sentences if they came clean about the crimes.
Colombia's National Centre for Historical Memory estimates 15,687 people were victims of sexual violence during the conflict, at the hands of right-wing paramilitary groups, security forces and the guerrillas.
Armed groups used sexual violence, including gang rape, to instill fear in communities, as a way of imposing their control over an area and as a form of punishment, rights groups have said.
The 2016 peace deal between the Colombian government and the FARC guarantees non-jail sentences for crimes related to the conflict, provided those responsible fully admit their wrongdoing and tell the truth about what happened. It also furnishes rebels who disarm with lodging and a monthly stipend.
The terms of the accord frustrated many Colombians and it was rejected in a referendum before a modified version was approved by Congress.   
 
IMPLEMENTING THE PEACE DEAL
Colombia's right-wing President Ivan Duque, who took office in August, has promised to toughen the terms of the peace deal and make FARC commanders pay for crimes with prison time. He has said those guilty of rape should not be provided with special treatment under the deal.
Yet Duque faces a challenge to overhaul the accord as most parties in Congress support it and the constitutional court has also ruled that the terms of the pact cannot be altered for three presidential terms.  
Former President Juan Manuel Santos, who signed the deal with the FARC, told Reuters in an interview in July that most Colombians wanted it implemented to turn the page on the conflict.
Duque has pledged not to do anything that would derail the accord as his government seeks to restore peace but a presidency spokesman said that he would continue to press for rapists to not receive amnesty.
Yet, with large areas of Colombia still prey to armed groups including dissident FARC fighters, Mexican-backed drug gangs, and the ELN leftist rebel group, some Colombians say they fear that tampering with the peace process could drive more former rebels to take up arms again.
More than 7 million people, nearly one sixth of the population, remain displaced by violence in Colombia after decades of internal conflict, according to government figures.
ABUSE BY PARAMILITARY AS WELL AS FARC
Tarquino, who runs the victims program in Soacha, has been holding meetings for women abused during the conflict for four years. Many of the women have, like Yeimy, had family members killed by the FARC rebels or right-wing paramilitary fighters.
Lina, who is now 49 and asked not to reveal her family name, said she was sexually assaulted 22 years ago in northern Colombia by paramilitaries belonging to the Heroes of the Montes de Maria group.
When she refused to take any more, the men sexually abused her using a tent pole, Lina said.
The paramilitary groups, which continued to operate in many parts of Colombia despite a 2006 peace deal, were founded by landowners to protect themselves from rebels but quickly turned to drug trafficking and violence.
Lina’s home province of Sucre was involved in a scandal that erupted in 2006 over ties between paramilitary fighters and local politicians that resulted in the arrest of several congressmen. 
""The doctors were named by them. The mayor was appointed by them,"" said Lina. ""I had to put on a mask to hide the pain that I felt from my child. After 22 years, I can finally declare the facts to the competent authorities.""
Colombia's government provides compensation to victims of sexual violence, including rape, under a 2011 law.
Lina has given testimony to a public defender and has been classified as a victim but has not yet received any compensation. Her case document, reviewed by Reuters, recognizes she suffered sexual violence, torture and personal injury. 
Lina took part in a secret meeting this year with former paramilitaries, including one of the men who abused her, in which they asked forgiveness. Reuters reviewed a video of the meeting but Lina asked not to reveal its location nor the identity of the men.
""We as women have to forgive because we cannot live with this anger inside us,""said Lina.

853,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 20, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>",Who will come out on top in Maldives election - and are the polls fair?,"(Reuters) - More than a quarter of a million people will vote on Sunday for the next leader of the small Indian Ocean nation of the Maldives in an election criticized internationally for a lack of transparency and suppression of government critics.
Restrictions on the media and alleged changes to voting practices have also raised questions over the fairness of the poll and created uncertainty over the post-election situation in the islands, best known as a luxury holiday destination and a key state in the battle for influence between India and China.
WHO HAS THE EDGE IN THE ELECTION?
With no opinion polls, calling a winner is difficult.
Non-government organizations and diplomats who have traveled to the country say opposition candidate Ibrahim Mohamed Solih (Ibu), pledging greater democracy and a corruption crackdown, would be likely to win if there were free and fair elections. 
President Abdulla Yameen, who is seeking a second five-year tenure, is campaigning on a promise to boost the economy in a Chinese-backed infrastructure drive - a vote-winning strategy, say his supporters. 
But his government has locked up scores of popular leaders who backed him in the 2013 polls including his half-brother, former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ruled the country for 30 years. 
Gayoom's wife posted a video on Thursday urging voters to ""end this tyranny"" and supporters of all the jailed leaders are expected to vote against Yameen, though that may not be enough to defeat him. 
HAS THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN BEEN FREE AND FAIR? 
Along with the jailing of opposition leaders for various reasons after speedy trials, Yameen has made several appointments activists say make a free and fair election difficult.
He annulled a Supreme Court ruling that quashed the convictions of nine opposition leaders, including former president Mohamed Nasheed, the country's first democratically elected leader, sparking a political crisis in February. 
He then appointed a new chief justice after removing his predecessor for ordering the releases, sacked two police chiefs and enacted laws in parliament without a required quorum. 
Diplomats say Yameen's action in the last 18 months have been aimed at removing any barriers to winning the election. 
HOW ABOUT THE ELECTION MONITORS? 
Many international organizations including the European Union have declined the offer to visit and monitor the election, fearing they might be used as a tacit endorsement to Yameen if there are voting irregularities. 
The Elections Commission has said 61 international monitors are expected, but they have not said who they will be. Locally they expect more than 2,000 monitors, but observers have expressed concern over new vote-counting rules they say will prevent them from seeing individual ballot papers - a charge the government denies. 
WHAT ABOUT INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE?
Backed by China and Saudi Arabia, Yameen has so far been able to resist international pressure to free his opponents over the last two years - though he did allow former president Nasheed to leave jail in 2016 for medical leave in Britain, where he claimed asylum. 
That could change in the future, however: the European Union and the United States have both warned of possible sanctions against Yameen and his allies if the upcoming elections are not free and fair. 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER THE ELECTION?
Most analysts and diplomats expect a chaotic situation with the loser not accepting the result. If Yameen loses, the opposition expects him to declare a state of emergency, use the Elections Commission and the Supreme Court to annul the poll and either call for a fresh election, or change the constitution to extend his term. Opposition candidate Ibu could also face arrest, they add. 
Even if Yameen loses, he will be the president until Nov. 17 this year, according to the constitution. 

If Ibu loses, the opposition is expected to protest across the country, but diplomats expect Yameen to use a state of emergency, police, and the military to control any such protests.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel said on Thursday it would not halt strikes on Syria but would do more to ""deconflict"" them with Russian forces, after Moscow accused it of ""irresponsible and unfriendly actions"" that led to Syrian ground fire mistakenly downing a Russian plane.
Fifteen Russian crew were killed when the IL-20 surveillance plane crashed near Latakia in northern Syria on Monday. Russia has said Syria shot the plane down shortly after Israeli jets hit the area, and accused Israel of creating the dangerous conditions by failing to give sufficient advance notice.
Although Russian President Vladimir Putin initially described the downing as ""tragic chance"", Moscow has made its anger clear.
""Moscow views as irresponsible and unfriendly actions of Israeli Air Force, which exposed Russian Il-20 aircraft to danger and led to death of 15 servicemen,"" the Russian embassy in Tel Aviv said on Twitter in English, adding that Russia would ""take all necessary measures to eliminate threat to life and security of our military fighting against terrorism"".
Israel has struck Syria scores of times during its seven-year civil war to prevent what it says are transfers of weapons to Hezbollah fighters and other Iranian allies. Russia has largely overlooked the sorties, which the Israelis say pose no direct threat to Moscow's ally, President Bashar al-Assad.
Israel dispatched its air force chief to brief Moscow about the incident on Thursday. Expressing regret at the loss of life, Israel denied wrongdoing and blamed what it called wanton Syrian anti-aircraft fire after its jets had withdrawn back over the border.
Speaking to Army Radio, Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman made clear that Israel would not halt attacks in Syria.
""We will do whatever is necessary to safeguard the security of Israel's citizens ... and we will not hold these discussions over the airwaves,"" he said.
But when pressed during the interview, Lieberman avoided asserting Israeli ""freedom of action"" over Syria, a term he has used in the past.
Naftali Bennett, another member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet, said ""deconfliction mechanisms"" would be improved, referring to a Russian-Israeli hotline designed to avoid inadvertent clashes with forces Moscow sent to Syria as part of a military intervention mounted in 2015. 
""We will of course strengthen these mechanisms. We will do everything so as not to harm anyone we do not intend to, God forbid,"" Bennett told Army Radio in a separate interview.
Ron Ben-Yishai, a veteran Israeli military commentator, predicted a more patient air force approach in future strikes.
""It is possible that, next time, they will say, 'Okay let's wait until the (Russian) plane goes back to its base, and then we will carry out the attack,'"" Ben-Yishai told Ynet TV.
Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrillas, who like their patron Iran have been helping Assad militarily in Syria, said Israeli strikes there would not prevent them getting advanced weaponry.
""No matter what you do to cut the route, the matter is over and the resistance possesses precision and non-precision rockets and weapons capabilities,"" Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a speech.

Huge crowds came from all over the world to commemorate the slaying of Imam Hussein, grandson of the Prophet Mohammed. 
Most Sunni Muslims also mourn Hussein's death, but less fervently, and Ashura is a reminder of Sunni-Shi'ite rifts dating from disputes over the Prophet Mohammad's succession.
In the past, suicide bombers staged attacks on the mass gathering hoping to trigger sectarian tensions.
Those days are gone. Iraqi worshippers are able to immerse themselves in their faith, setting aside other problems that impact daily lives, including poor government services, unemployment and corruption.
Ashura is the 10th day of the lunar month of Muharram when according to Islamic tradition Imam Hussein was killed in battle in 680.
It is observed in Iraq and in other countries with sizeable Shi’ite communities, including Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Iran, Lebanon, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Syria. 
On the first day of Muharram, the army of Caliph Yazid laid siege to Hussein and followers in the desert near Kerbala. Hussein was killed in battle 10 days later after he had refused to pledge allegiance to Yazid. 
Hussein was decapitated and his head was taken to Damascus, the seat of the Ummayad dynasty to which Yazid belonged.
Self-flagellation is a big part of the ritual.
On Thursday, crowds of pilgrims brandished swords. One man gashed the head of a teenager with a knife. Blood dripped down their heads to white smocks. A pilgrim banged a drum.
""Blood is but a simple thing we offer to Hussein. All we offer Hussein is actually nothing,"" said pilgrim Haider Sabah.

""Even if we give our lives for him it is not enough. We are ready to offer all we have, our lives, our children and our families for Hussein to have his intercession in doomsday.""

The center-right government garnered support for the reshuffle after initial internal coalition tussles, although analysts say Prime Minister Boyko Borissov needed to do more to boost support for his government, which took office in May 2017.
More than 20 people were also injured in the crush in late August in northwest Bulgaria, in which a bus fell into a ravine. 
The accident triggered a heated public debate over government accountability for quality of road construction and transport safety.
The chamber voted to appoint Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the telecoms regulator, as transport minister. 
Petya Avramova, a lawmaker from ruling GERB party, will take over regional development and the interior ministry's secretary general, Mladen Marinov, will be the new interior minister.
The opposition Socialists voted against the appointments, demanding the resignation of the whole government.

There is no immediate risk of political instability or early elections, analysts say, adding that the government should be able to push ahead with reforms ahead of the European election next spring - seen as a test whether it would be able to carry out its full mandate.

Shortly after takeoff from the financial capital of Mumbai, the flight crew forgot to select a switch to maintain cabin pressure and oxygen masks were deployed, India's civil aviation regulator said.
The plane returned to Mumbai, where 30 of its 166 passengers were treated for minor injuries, including headaches and bleeding from the nose or ears, the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation said in a statement.
Jet Airways did not immediately respond to an email from Reuters to seek comment. 
Videos taken by passengers quickly went viral on social media, focusing public attention on the airline at a time when it is struggling to cut costs and embroiled in a pay dispute with pilots.

The airline, partly owned by Etihad Airways, last month said it would inject funds and cut costs in excess of $278 million over two years to try to stem losses.

Hundreds of people have been killed in Xinjiang in recent years in unrest between the Uighur minority which calls the region home and members of the ethnic Han Chinese majority. Reports of mass detentions and strict surveillance of Uighurs have sparked a growing international outcry.
U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has called on China to allow in monitors, while the United States is considering sanctions against Chinese officials and companies linked to allegations of rights abuses in Xinjiang.
China has rejected all accusations of mistreatment in Xinjiang, but also says it has to crack down on separatism and militancy.
Speaking at a daily news briefing in Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Xinjiang was stable, its economy developing well, its people living in harmony and enjoying religious freedom.
In 2017, Xinjiang received more than 100 million domestic and overseas tourists, up a third on the previous year, Geng said.
For the first seven months of this year, it received more than 78 million visits, up almost 40 percent on the same period a year earlier, he added.
""If Xinjiang were not safe, stable and harmonious, then there would not be so many Chinese and foreign tourists going to Xinjiang for sight-seeing,"" Geng said. ""I think that this aspect proves Xinjiang's current good situation.""
While Xinjiang has been keen to promote itself as a tourist destination, foreign reporters who visit tend to be kept under close surveillance by security forces.
Beijing says Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists. Officials deny mistreating Muslims there, instead saying they are putting some people through ""vocational"" style courses to prevent militancy spreading.

Brian Hook, U.S. special envoy for Iran, said on Wednesday the United States is seeking to negotiate a treaty with Iran to include Tehran's ballistic missiles and its regional behavior.
Iran has rejected U.S. attempts to hold high-level talks since President Donald Trump tore up a nuclear deal between Tehran and six world powers earlier this year.
Anwar Gargash, United Arab Emirates Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, described Hook's comments as ""important"".
""It is essential that the Gulf Arab states be a party to the proposed negotiations. It is prudent for Tehran to avoid sanctions and to take these proposals seriously,"" he tweeted.
The UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain swiftly backed Trump's decision in May to withdraw from the nuclear accord and reimpose sanctions on Tehran. The Sunni Muslim-ruled states are at loggerheads with Shi'ite Iran, fighting a proxy war that has influenced conflicts in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.
The Gulf Arab states were not party to the nuclear accord, and while they were consulted by Western powers during the talks that led up to it, they played no direct role in those negotiations.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo listed a dozen demands in May that he said could make up a new agreement, although Hook referred to a treaty, which would have to be approved by the U.S. Senate.

Hezbollah, backed by Iran, has played a critical role in supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad during Syria's seven-year-long civil war.
Israel regards Hezbollah as the biggest threat on its borders and has said that it has carried out repeated strikes in Syria to prevent it getting arms deliveries from Iran.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards helped form Hezbollah in the early 1980s to resist Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon, which ended in 2000. Israel and Hezbollah fought a brief war on Lebanese soil in 2006.

It was the latest such incident to cause a public outcry in South Africa and shows the racial tensions that endure more than two decades after the end of apartheid rule.
In the video on Twitter, a man identifies himself as Kessie Nair and says ""(I) hereby call for that kaffir state president Mr Cyril Ramaphosa to be charged for frauding this nation, for oppressing this nation.""
Representatives for Nair could not be reached for comment.
The ""K word"", as it is known in South Africa, is apartheid-era slang for a black person and is regarded as a deeply offensive slur on a par with the ""N word"" in the United States. 
The man will appear at a magistrates court in Kwa-Zulu Natal province on charges of crimen injuria and inciting public violence after he was arrested on Wednesday, a police spokesman said.
South Africa remains deeply scarred by its apartheid and colonial past.

Below are comments of leaders arriving on Thursday.
FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON
""First of all, I'm not the one who created an Irish government... Second, we have very clear principles regarding the integrity of the single market and regarding precisely the Irish border. It was precise in March and it was endorsed by the 27 members. So, we have to find collectively and we need a UK proposal precisely preserving this backstop in the framework of a withdrawal agreement."" 
""I never command speculations. I have sufficient work with reality.""
IRISH PRIME MINISTER LEO VARADKAR
""I had a very good meeting this morning with Prime Minister May and her team. Time is running short. There's proposals for another summit in October and then in November. Ireland is a country that obviously wants to avoid a no deal scenario, we want to avoid a no deal Brexit, (but) we are preparing for that, we are hiring extra staff and officials, putting in IT systems, we're ready for that eventuality should it occur. But I think we need to double our efforts over the next couple of weeks to make sure that we have a deal."" 
""That deal of course would involve three elements, so withdrawal agreements providing for the UK to leave with a transition period, a protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland making sure that under all circumstances there won't be a hard border on the island of Ireland, and also a joint political declaration outlining what that new relationship is going to look like.""
""Prime Minister May and I have conversations about this all the time, but this is a negotiation between the European Union and United Kingdom, and Ireland is staying at the heart of Europe, we're staying in the single market in the Euro, we help defend those great projects that have brought enormous prosperity across the continent of Europe. So this ultimately is going to be a new treaty, a new negotiation between the EU and the UK.""
""We have a border already in the sense that there's a political border and different currencies used in Northern Ireland vs. Ireland, for example, so a political border does exist. What we want to avoid is any new barriers to the movement of goods, any new barriers to trade, any new barriers to the movement of people. Just think of all the people everyday who cross the border to work or study, think of all the businesses who trade across the border, so that's what we're trying to engineer in many ways, is a new relationship that at least when it comes to those matters, is very much like the one we have now, but that's difficult to do.""
BELGIAN PRIME MINISTER CHARLES MICHEL
""Today I can see that it is necessary to make all the steps because the proposals are not enough in order to have an agreement.""
EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER
ON THE PRESENTATION OF BRITISH PM THERESA MAY ON WEDNESDAY
""It was interesting, it was polite, it was not aggressive. She is doing her job.""
LUXEMBOURG PRIME MINISTER XAVIER BETTEL
""We listened to Teresa May yesterday, I think that she told us the efforts the British government did, and today we listen to Michel Barnier on the different points. I still believe that there's some difficult points. I fully believe that we will be able to find an agreement.""
""It's a compromise from both sides, it's not on one side.""
AUSTRIAN CHANCELLOR SEBASTIAN KURZ

VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - A regional election in Russia's Far East will be re-run, the local election commission said on Thursday, dealing a rare blow to the Kremlin after allegations the vote had been rigged in its candidate's favor.
The ruling, in Russia's Primorsky Region which includes the Pacific port of Vladivostok, 6,400 km (4,000 miles) east of Moscow, came a day after Russia's top election official recommended that the election be re-run.
Ella Pamfilova, head of the Central Election Commission, had not accused the Kremlin-backed candidate, Andrei Tarasenko, of orchestrating the vote-rigging, but had said that a raft of irregularities had been identified, including ballot stuffing and vote buying.
""We believe that in the circumstances it is not possible to reliably understand the result of the will of the people, which means we can't declare either of the candidates elected,"" Tatyana Gladkikh, the chairwoman of the local election commission, said on Thursday.
The new election must be held within three months of the annulled Sept. 16 vote.
Tarasenko's struggles and three other reversals in elections to select regional governors this month amount to the worst showing for Kremlin-backed candidates since 2012.
Though there is no immediate threat to the ruling United Russia party's grip on power, it suggests growing discontent over living standards, not least plans to delay the retirement age, which have also been reflected in declining popularity ratings for President Vladimir Putin.
The decision to re-run the election was made after Communist Party supporters took to the streets of Vladivostok to protest after Tarasenko mounted an improbable comeback in the final stages of counting to edge out his Communist challenger Andrei Ishchenko.
Ishchenko said on Thursday he disagreed with the decision to have a re-run and judged he should be declared the winner of the original vote. The Interfax news agency cited him as saying he would try to overturn the ruling for a re-run via the courts. 
Tarasenko, the Kremlin-backed candidate, said the ruling to re-run the election was fair, saying there had been too many complaints. 
With just under 99 percent of votes counted on Sunday night, Tarasenko was trailing Ishchenko by more than 2 percentage points.

But on Monday, the local election commission said Tarasenko had won by just over 1 percentage point, with results showing he had received almost every one of the final 20,000 votes counted.

Thailand has tough lese-majeste laws, with those found guilty of defaming, insulting or threatening members of the royal family facing up to 15 years in jail, but there have been no fresh prosecutions this year in what one rights lawyer said ""appears to be a new policy direction"".
The six, aged between 18 and 20, were arrested last year for setting fire to portraits of King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his father, the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, at several spots around the northeastern province of Khon Kaen.
A court found them guilty of lese-majeste, arson damaging public property and organized crime. 
One of the six was jailed for 11 and a half years, three received terms of seven years and eight months, while two got three years and four months.
The appeals court on Tuesday cut the jail terms slightly - nine years instead of 11 and a half; six years instead of seven years and eight months; and three years instead of three years and four months.
""They are happy not to be sentenced under Article 112 (lese-majeste) because they did not have any ill intention,"" their lawyer, Pattana Saiyai, said.
He said earlier the six had been hired to burn the royal portraits. Two men were jailed in June in connection with this.
The military, which took control of the government in a May 2014 coup, has said it needs to crack down on critics of the monarchy for the sake of national security.
Since the coup, at least 94 people have been prosecuted for lese-majeste, but the Thai Lawyers for Human Rights Centre said there had been no such prosecutions this year.
Only 10 lese-majeste cases remained before the courts, Pawinee Chumsri, a lawyer for the Thai Lawyers for Human Rights Centre, said.
""Since the beginning of this year, the court has dropped Article 112 prosecutions and pursued other charges instead,"" Pawinee told Reuters. ""It appears to be a new policy direction.""
A source within the junta, formally known as the National Council for Peace and Order, said the government was ""careful"" with lese-majeste prosecutions because of accusations that it uses the royal defamation law for political purposes.
All lese-majeste complaints were now being carefully screened by a police committee before any prosecution, the source said.

Rescuers were called to Cid Harbour at Whitsunday Island, near the Great Barrier Reef, on Thursday afternoon and found the girl with bad leg injuries, said Tracey Eastwick, the regional ambulance operations manager.
""The patient's injuries today are again a shark attack bite to the patient's thigh area, with significant blood loss,"" Eastwick told reporters in Mackay, where the girl is in a serious condition in hospital.
""It is horrific ... it is quite confronting to have two similar incidents in the space of 24 hours,"" she said.
Australia ranked behind only the United States in the number of unprovoked shark encounters with humans in 2017, according to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack File.
The island where the girl was bitten is a popular tourist site 900 km (560 miles) northwest of the state capital Brisbane.
The attack followed the dramatic rescue of a 46-year-old woman, Justine Barwick, who was bitten by a shark while swimming at dusk from a yacht in the same area on Wednesday evening.
Barwick was badly hurt on the upper right leg, ambulance officials said, and a doctor who was on a nearby boat attended to her until rescuers arrived by helicopter. 
The doctor, John Hadock, was about to go for a swim when he was summoned to jump into a dinghy and rush to Barwick's aid.
""I was very worried that I might find severe bleeding still going. They had been able to stop the bleeding but Justine was very, very ill,"" he told Channel Seven television.
Hadock said he treated Barwick before a helicopter crew winched her to safety and flew her to Mackay hospital, where a spokeswoman said Barwick is in critical condition.
Last year, a spate of shark attacks off Australia's northeast coast led to the controversial deployment of protective nets, which authorities said would save lives and guard the country's reputation as a tourist destination.
Environmentalists say the nets can also harm a number of threatened and migratory species.
A teenage girl was killed in 2017 by a shark while surfing at a break in Western Australia, and a surf competition at Margaret River was canceled after two surfers were bitten by sharks.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used a visit to a secretive Israeli atomic reactor in late August to warn the country’s enemies that it has the means to destroy them, in what appeared to be a veiled reference to its assumed nuclear arsenal.
""The United Nations’ members should not turn a blind eye to these threats and must take firms actions to eliminate all Israeli nuclear weapons,"" Fars news agency quoted Iran's ambassador to the United Nations Gholamali Khoshrou as saying in letters to the U.N. secretary general and the security council.
Khoshrou asked the United Nations to force Israel to join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and bring its nuclear program under supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a UN atomic watchdog.
Israel, which is outside the NPT, neither confirms nor denies having the bomb, a decades-old “ambiguity” policy that it says keeps hostile neighbors in check while avoiding the kind of public provocations that can spark regional arms races.
Israel is trying to lobby world powers to follow the United States in exiting their 2015 deal with Iran that capped the Islamic Republic’s nuclear capabilities in return for lifting of sanctions.
The Israelis deem the agreement insufficient for denying their arch-foe the means to eventually get the bomb - something that Tehran, which is a signatory to the 1970 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), denies wanting.
Since its 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran has preached Israel’s destruction. It backs the Lebanese militia Hezbollah and the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas. Its reinforcement of Damascus during Syria’s civil war is seen by the Netanyahu government as a further Iranian deployment on Israel’s borders.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia on Thursday increased the jail term to 15 years for anyone convicted of contaminating foodstuffs as a scare over needles found in strawberries and other fruits gripped the country.
Police are investigating more than 100 reports of sewing needles found in strawberries, which have forced farmers to dump fruit as demand plummets, and cast a shadow over an industry worth A$160 million ($116 million).
Australia's parliament passed legislation on Thursday to increase the maximum prison term to 15 years from 10 years for anyone convicted of tampering with food, in line with offences such as financing terrorism.
It also criminalized hoax claims, making them punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
""That's how seriously I take this,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Royalla, a rural town 35 km (21 miles) south of the capital Canberra.
The legislation was rushed through in less than day as lawmakers try to repair public trust in the strawberry industry.
Politicians across the political divide spent much of the day promoting the industry, with Morrison promising to cook a strawberry curry.
Strawberry farmers have welcomed the action, saying they faced financial ruin if demand did not recover quickly. 
Consumers remained wary, forcing retailers in Australia and New Zealand to pull strawberries from store shelves. 
Australia supermarket giant Woolworths said on Thursday it had also withdrawn sewing needles from its shelves nationally. 
""We've taken the precautionary step of temporarily removing sewing needles from sale in our stores. The safety of our customers is our top priority,"" a Woolworths spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.

If Abe, who resigned abruptly after a troubled 2006-2007 term, stays in office through November 2019, he will have exceeded the 2,886 days marked by Taro Katsura in the early 20th century.
""I want to tackle constitutional reform together with all of you,"" Abe told his Liberal Democratic Party after the vote.
First, however, he has the immediate challenge of a likely summit with U.S. President Donald Trump next week, when he will face pressure to cut Japan's $69 billion surplus with its key ally, nearly two-thirds from auto exports. 
Abe must also keep economic growth on track with a dwindling policy tool-kit. After years of heavy money printing, the Bank of Japan has little ammunition left. Japan's huge public debt and rising social welfare costs for a fast-ageing population also leave Abe with little room to ramp up fiscal spending.
Abe, who surged back to power in 2012 promising to reboot the economy and strengthen defense, defeated former defense minister Shigeru Ishiba in the LDP leadership election.
Abe won 553 votes to Ishiba's 254. Of the 810 votes up for grabs from LDP parliamentarians and rank-and-file party members, 807 were valid.
Abe is assured the premiership because his LDP-led coalition controls parliament.
TRADE IMBALANCE
Abe is expected to meet Trump on the sidelines of a U.N. General Assembly meeting next week. They have forged close ties but Trump has made clear he's unhappy about the bilateral trade imbalance and wants a two-way agreement to address it.
Tokyo opposes a bilateral deal for fear it would boost pressure on sensitive sectors such as agriculture.
The Trump administration is also exploring raising tariffs on Japanese auto exports, a step Japanese officials say would do serious damage to the two economies and world trade.
At home, the premier's ""Abenomics"" recipe of hyper-easy monetary policy, spending and structural reform has helped reflate growth, although critics say reforms came up short.
Now he is pledging to reform social security, making it easier for people to stay in the workforce and offset Japan's shrinking population by raising the retirement age to above 65 and letting them defer pension payouts beyond age 70.
Abe is also promising to invest in infrastructure to cope with the natural disasters that increasingly batter Japan, though more spending could make it harder to rein in debt.
He has said he will implement a planned rise in the sales tax to 10 percent from 8 percent in October 2019 but that could hit the economy just as Trump's protectionist policies could hurt Japanese exports.
High among Abe's personal priorities is revising the post-war constitution's pacifist Article 9 to clarify the military's ambiguous status. The article, if taken literally, bans maintenance of armed forces but has been interpreted to allow a military for self-defense.

The amendment would be a largely symbolic change, but pushing for it would be politically risky since the public is divided. Amendments require approval by two-thirds of both houses of parliament and a majority in a public referendum.

Four people were pulled out alive after boulders and earth loosened by rain engulfed a cluster of homes near a limestone quarry on the fringes of Naga City on the central island of Cebu.
""The landslide buried about 20 to 24 houses and all the people inside were trapped,"" regional police official Debold Sinas told reporters.
Rescuers were looking for about 50 to 80 people, city councillor Carmelino Cruz told the ANC news channel. 
""The ground is still shaky,"" Cruz added. ""Every now and then you will hear vibrations.""
Heavy weekend rains brought by Typhoon Mangkhut caused more than 100 landslides, most in the mountainous Cordillera region on the main island of Luzon. The storm's death toll countrywide was 88 by Thursday, police said, most from the landslides.
A major recovery effort was underway in Itogon at a small mining site, where the bodies of 21 people, mostly miners, had been found by late on Wednesday.
Rescuers looking for 53 people buried since Saturday say there is little chance of finding survivors.
Rescuers in Cebu on Thursday had heard cries and shouting from under the rubble, media said.
""I was sleeping when I heard a loud noise,"" said Vhann Quisido, who had a lucky escape when a tide of earth and rocks stopped behind his house.

""I was waiting for the land to come into our house. It was very traumatic,"" he said by telephone.

Bolsonaro, who is recovering in hospital from a near-fatal stabbing two weeks ago, is backed by 28 percent of the voters surveyed by polling firm Datafolha, a gain of 2 points since the previous poll a week ago.
The Workers Party's candidate Fernando Haddad surged into second place with 16 percent of the voters surveyed backing him, a 3 percentage point rise, but he is statistically tied with Ciro Gomes, a center-left populist.
Datafolha surveyed 8,601 voters across Brazil on Sept. 18 to 19. The poll, published by the newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, has a margin of error of 2 percentage points.
Haddad replaced jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on the ticket nine days ago. 
Gomes' support remained at 13 percent, according to Datafolha.
With no candidate projected to win a majority in the first ballot, the two best-performing hopefuls will meet in a run-off.
Gomes is the only candidate projected to beat Bolsonaro in a second-round vote, according to the poll. 
Gomes, a former Ceará state governor would defeat Bolsonaro with 45 percent of the votes against 39 percent for the right-winger, Datafolha said.
Bolsonaro, a former army captain who favors easing gun controls, may have trouble winning a second round race against Haddad as they are tied at 41 percent each, according to Datafolha.
Bolsonaro shot ahead early in the race by tapping the anger of Brazilians fed up with political corruption and rising crime. 
The poll indicated that Lula's strategy of convincing his supporters to vote for Haddad, a former mayor of Sao Paulo, is working well and his stand-in could well reach the second-round vote.
Two-term president Lula was banned from running due to a corruption conviction but he remains Brazil's most influential politician and his party is could return to power after governing Brazil from 2003 to 2016.
Among the other candidates in the first-round vote, Geraldo Alckmin, a favorite of the country's business class and a former governor of Sao Paulo, stayed at 9 percent and environmentalist Marina Silva sunk to 7 percent, less than half the support she had the outset of the campaign last month.
The most divisive election since the end of Brazil's military rule three decades ago has become increasingly polarized between right and left, raising concerns about the future of the country's democracy.
Bolsonaro, an admirer of Brazil's 1964 to 1985 military regime, has accused the Workers Party of trying to rig the elections. His running mate retired General Hamilton Mourão has said the armed forces should carry out a coup if the country's judiciary cannot end political corruption.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican authorities said on Wednesday they had fired the top prosecutor in Jalisco state, the second official to lose his job after the discovery of a container truck holding the bodies of hundreds of victims of the country's drug war.
Authorities are struggling to manage the death toll in the western state, which is home to one of the country's most powerful drug gangs and has already seen a record number of killings this year. 
With morgues at capacity, a refrigerated semi-trailer truck filled with corpses was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of the state capital and, later, near a residential neighborhood, touching off an uproar.
During a press conference Wednesday evening, authorities said the truck held 273 bodies, up from the previous count of 157. Another truck was found with 49 bodies inside.
Speaking to reporters, Governor Aristoteles Sandoval attributed the problem to poor planning and insensitivity on the part of state officials. The state will ensure all the bodies are stored adequately by Oct. 15, Sandoval said.
""We can't accept acts of indifference, of a lack of sensitivity,"" Sandoval told reporters. ""There is no way I will tolerate them.""
Authorities said they had dismissed the state's top prosecutor, Raul Sanchez. Sanchez could not immediately be reached for comment late Wednesday evening. 
On Tuesday, the state fired Luis Octavio Cotero, who had headed the forensic institute. Cotero told Reuters that his agency was not responsible for storing the unclaimed bodies, and accused the government of making him a scapegoat.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian doctors said on Thursday a ""humanitarian emergency"" is unfolding at an Australian-run detention center in the Pacific and they asked for government permission to treat asylum seekers at the remote facility.
Australia's hardline immigration policy requires asylum seekers intercepted at sea trying to reach Australia to be sent for processing to three camps in Papua New Guinea and one on the South Pacific island of Nauru.
In a letter to Prime Minister Scott Morrison, the Australian Medical Association (AMA) said there was an urgent need to send a delegation of doctors to Nauru after reports of some asylum seekers harming themselves.
""There are now too many credible reports concerning the effects of long-term detention and uncertainty on the physical and mental health of asylum seekers,"" AMA President Tony Bartone said in the letter seen by Reuters.
The AMA represents doctors and medical students.
More than 1,000 men, woman and children are living in the camps in Papua New Guinea and Nauru. They are told they will never be settled in Australia.
Morrison declined to comment on the AMA letter when asked by reporters in Canberra. He said many asylum seekers would soon be transferred to the United States. 
The United States has said it will accept up to 1,250 refugees from Australia's detention centers. Refugee advocates said about 300 have been resettled so far.
Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said in May hundreds of asylum-seekers are likely to remain in the centers indefinitely as no other country is willing to resettle them.
The detention of about 100 children, some of whom have spent their entire lives on Nauru, has drawn the most severe criticism, spurred by a recent spate of self-harm incidents.
Australia, which claims the policy is necessary to deter drownings at sea, has transferred several children off Nauru.
In August, Australia relocated a 12-year Iranian boy who had been on a hunger strike, two sources familiar with the transfer said.

Chinese President Xi Jinping has overseen a drive to re-assert the ruling Communist Party, its ideology and its history at the center of education, and to promote patriotism in the place of ideas that the party considers Western.
The sweep by China's education ministry, running until Oct 15, will ""correct and dispose of"" illegal foreign or self-written courses used instead of state-approved materials in China's nine-year compulsory education period, the official Xinhua news agency said.
""Recently, it has been discovered that some companies that write and publish textbooks have without permission altered the content of certain textbooks, and certain schools are using their own textbooks in the place of national textbooks,"" the ministry's teaching materials bureau told Xinhua.
From the 2019 Spring term onwards, the ministry will continue to make follow up checks and random inspections and any serious cases of schools still found to be using unapproved content can be held accountable by law, Xinhua said.
Attempts by the Chinese Communist Party to make love of the motherland and its own history and ideology a core part of the country's education system have increasingly come up against a flourishing private school sector and an interest in alternative or foreign education among middle class families.
In response, the Chinese government has ramped up oversight of schooling with new regulations guiding textbook content and private schooling.

Xi has called for greater ""ideological guidance"" in Chinese universities and has launched efforts to re-vamp mandatory ideology classes that teach about Marxism, Mao Zedong Tought and Xi's own signature ideology.

General Qamar Javed Bajwa is the most senior Pakistani figure to visit ally China since the new government of Prime Minister Imran Khan took office in August, and his trip comes a week or so after a senior Chinese diplomat visited Islamabad.
Pakistan has deepened ties with China in recent years as relations with the United States have frayed.
Bajwa may be hoping to smooth out any Chinese alarm at comments last week by Pakistan's commerce minister, Abdul Razak Dawood, who suggested suspending for a year projects in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the Pakistan leg of China's Belt and Road Initiative that includes recreating the old Silk Road trading route.
Meeting Bajwa on Wednesday, Xi said the two countries were ""iron friends"", China's official Xinhua news agency said on Thursday.
""China always places a high premium on China-Pakistan relations,"" the report cited Xi as saying.
Xi expressed his appreciation for the support and security safeguards provided by Pakistan for the Belt and Road Initiative and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor construction, Xinhua added.
""As long as high-degree mutual trust and concrete measures are in place, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor construction will succeed and deliver benefits to people of the two countries,"" Xi said.

Beijing has pledged to invest about $60 billion in Pakistan for infrastructure for the Belt and Road project.

The 82-22 vote in favor of Vizcarra commits Congress to passing his judicial and political reforms, and marks a rare victory over the conservative opposition party that controls the single-chamber legislature. 
Vizcarra called for a vote of confidence late on Sunday to force passage of legislation to curb graft and rebuild trust in public institutions following back-to-back scandals in recent years.

Under Peru's constitution, a vote of no-confidence would have forced Vizcarra to replace his entire cabinet, but he would have been allowed to call new legislative elections.

(Reuters) - The mysterious 11-day closure of a New Mexico solar observatory stemmed from an FBI investigation of a janitor suspected of using the facility's wireless internet service to send and receive child pornography, federal court documents showed on Wednesday.
The National Solar Observatory in Sunspot, New Mexico, was evacuated without public explanation on Sept. 6, leading to a swirl of social media speculation and rumors driven by its proximity to two U.S. military installations and the town of Roswell.
Approximately two hours away from the observatory by car, Roswell was the site of a famous 1947 sighting of unidentified flying objects that the U.S. Air Force later said were top-secret high-altitude weather balloons.
UFO conspiracy lore has it that a flying saucer crashed near Roswell, and that remains of the craft and alien crew were clandestinely removed from the crash site by the government and taken to a top-secret test site in Nevada for examination.
But the mystery of the Sunspot Observatory closure proved far less complicated. It was finally explained in newly unsealed FBI records, including a 39-page application for a warrant to search the suspect's residence.
An agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation wrote in the affidavit that she was ""investigating the activities of an individual who was utilizing the wireless internet service of the National Solar Observatory in Sunspot, New Mexico, to download and distribute child pornography.""
The FBI affidavit identified the suspect as a janitor under contract to clean the facility, whose laptop was found to have been used to connect to the observatory's wireless system. 
According to the affidavit, observatory officials made the decision to close and evacuate the site out of concern that the suspect might pose a danger to other personnel.
The observatory was reopened on Monday.
The person has not been arrested or charged, and no arrest warrant has been issued, according to the FBI.
Frank Fisher, a spokesman for the FBI field office in Albuquerque, told Reuters that the case was still under investigation.
The warrant issued by a U.S. magistrate in Las Cruces, New Mexico, showed that on Sept. 14 agents removed from the man's home three cell phones, five laptops, one iPad, an external hard drive, 16 thumb drives, 89 compact flash disks and other material.

Xu Qin, a founder of Zhongjin Capital and related companies, was given a life sentence by the Shanghai No. 2 Intermediate People's Court on Wednesday, the official Shanghai Daily newspaper reported. The court gave nine others sentences ranging from five to 12 years, it said.
The Zhongjin empire grew quickly and even opened an imposing office on Shanghai's historic - and expensive - Bund, luring eager investors seeking the double-digit returns it promised on short-term financing products, part of a then-thriving ""shadow banking"" sector.
However, the image of riches and success that it cultivated came crashing down in early 2016. Police arrested 21 executives linked to Zhongjin, including Xu, on suspicion of ""illegal fundraising"".
The Shanghai Daily said Xu and the nine others who were sentenced on Wednesday had been unable to make a profit ""so used online ads, offline promotions and TV commercials to convince people that Zhongjin companies were rich and reputable"".
""They fabricated financing products with short-term, yet extremely high, returns to pull in investors,"" it said. They had illegally collected 40 billion yuan, it said, and much of the money was spent cultivating an image of wealth and reputability.
Xu was detained on April 4, 2016, attempting to board a flight out of Shanghai, the newspaper said.
The 10 people sentenced still owed more than 12,000 investors more than 4.8 billion yuan, it said. Their personal assets and company properties were frozen to pay debts.

GUATEMALA CITY/UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations said on Wednesday that it would send an assistant director to lead its anti-graft mission in Guatemala as the group's chief remains banned from entering the country. 
In a letter to President Jimmy Morales, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he stood by Ivan Velasquez, who leads the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, but would instruct him to name a deputy, according to a copy of the correspondence seen by Reuters. 
""I see no reason to lose confidence in Commissioner Velasquez,"" Guterres wrote in the letter dated Tuesday. ""Nevertheless, considering the fact that he finds himself impeded from doing his work in Guatemala, I have asked the commissioner to name a deputy commissioner who can continue the work in the country, after consultation with authorities."" 
Under the agreement struck between the United Nations and Guatemala to create CICIG, the United Nations appoints the CICIG leader, who in turn appoints staff. The agreement does not mention consulting with authorities about staff appointments.
President Morales' moves to dismantle CICIG have prompted what critics call a ""constitutional crisis"" in the country after his government appeared to defy an order by a top court permitting Velasquez's return. 
Last month, Morales announced he would not renew the group's mandate. Days later, he banned Velasquez, a hard-charging Colombian prosecutor, from re-entering the Central American country. 
Guatemala's constitutional court issued a provisional ruling on Sunday allowing Velasquez to return. But the government has nonetheless refused to let him set foot in Guatemala, asking the United Nations on Monday to name a new leader for the mission within 48 hours. 
The moves against CICIG have drawn international condemnation and sparked protests across Guatemala. 
Founded in 2007 to investigate criminal groups in Guatemala, CICIG brought down former President Otto Perez with a corruption probe and sought to prosecute Morales, a former comedian, over illegal financing allegations.

CICIG has said Velasquez is working in New York and following the case.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican troops and police committed two extrajudicial killings while confronting presumed fuel thieves in the central state of Puebla in May 2017, a Mexican human rights group said on Wednesday, adding to allegations of abuse against the military.
A report by the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) said police and troops manipulated the scene by placing high-caliber firearms beside the two bodies. Eight other people died and 13 people, including four minors, were detained with excessive force, the report said.
Neither the defense ministry nor the Puebla police force responded to requests for comment. The state government declined to comment.
The military has assumed some police duties in Mexico for more than a decade, working to combat rising drug violence that contributed to a record 31,000 homicides in 2017. Their increased responsibilities have coincided with accusations of human rights violations including extrajudicial killings, kidnappings and torture. 
""As a result of its investigation, the CNDH has the evidence to show grave violations to human rights and personal freedom,"" the group said of the reported deaths in Puebla.
The CNDH urged state oil firm Pemex to cooperate in investigations and not let its property be used to hold detainees. 
Pemex did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The CNDH previously found that armed forces were involved in the murder of four people in the state of Tamaulipas in 2014, and that soldiers arbitrarily executed two people after an illegal raid in 2016. 
""This case is one more example of how the Mexican military violates human rights,"" Amnesty International said in a statement in response to the CNDH report. ""It's time for the armed forces to return to their barracks."" 
The CNDH called on the Mexican attorney general's office to investigate, and said national and state officials should provide reparations for the victims. 
Mexico's congress passed a controversial security law last year that would lay out the rules under which the armed forces can operate in the battle with organized crime. The law was strongly criticized by opponents who fear it could open the door to more abuses. 
Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has said the law will not be implemented until it is reviewed by the Supreme Court.

Colombian President Ivan Duque said in his inaugural address last month he would take 30 days to evaluate the talks and had urged the National Liberation Army (ELN) to release 19 hostages before dialogue could resume. 
The deadline has passed without a definitive government decision on whether to continue.
The guerrillas have so far freed nine hostages, all members of the security forces or contractors. The remaining ten hostages are civilians.
Duque will name a new negotiating team if the ELN frees the hostages and ceases criminal activities, High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos told journalists, adding the decision was ""merely administrative.""
The negotiators finished their contracts on Aug. 3, just before former President Juan Manuel Santos left office, he said.
""There isn't any justification to say that the possibilities are closing,"" Ceballos said. ""It's simply confirming an administrative decision of the previous government.""
The ELN, considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union, has been at war with the Colombian government since 1964.

""We’ve always recognized that there are unique circumstances that apply in Northern Ireland, for example in relation to checks for some agricultural products. But what we cannot accept is seeing Northern Ireland carved away effectively from the United Kingdom’s customs territory.
""Regardless of where the checks will be, what that would mean is that there would be a challenge to our constitutional and economic integrity.""
She criticized some members of the opposition Labour Party for pressing for a vote to reverse the 2016 Brexit referendum:
""There are prominent Labour members like the mayor of London who are now trying to take us back to square one and are backing a second referendum and postponing the Brexit date, the exit day. I want to be absolutely clear - this government will never accept a second referendum.

Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29, 2019, and Tusk said that he would call a Brexit summit for mid-November.
Raab said he believed that a deal could be struck in the current timeframe, and ruled out delaying or suspending Article 50 -- the EU treaty clause that Britain invoked to start the exit process -- to buy more time.
""We won't extend Article 50. We don't need to extend Article 50... we've got enough time,"" he said, adding that Britain would leave on March 29 even if it meant a ""no deal"" Brexit.
Asked about comments from a minister earlier in the day that no Brexit deal could make a second referendum more likely, Raab reiterated that the government would not call a second referendum, and that parliament was unlikely to ask for one.

""What he's saying is, if we end up with no deal, the risk is that parliament, because of the arithmetic, might try and direct the government a certain way. I don't think that's a likely outcome,"" he said.

An Israeli military spokeswoman said she had no knowledge of the incident, initially.
Ashraf Al-Qidra, a spokesman for Gaza's health ministry, said 15-year-old Moamen Ibrahim Abu Eyada was shot dead by Israeli soldiers east of the town of Rafah, which lies at the southern end of the Gaza Strip and borders Egypt.
The border between Gaza and Israel has been the scene of weekly Palestinian demonstrations since March 30 and recently, protests have taken place late at night, as was the case on Wednesday.
The Israeli military said earlier that during the day there had been several incidents along the Gaza-Israel border ""with the participation of hundreds of rioters"" who rolled burning tires and hurled firebombs and rocks at soldiers. It said there were no Israeli casualties.
At least 182 Palestinians have been killed in the protests, according to Palestinian health officials.
The Israeli army says it is defending its border against rioting protesters who have sought to breach the fence and enter Israel.
Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintains tight control of its land and sea borders and has fought three wars there in the past decade against Hamas Islamist militants that control the territory.
With Egypt, Israel has imposed a blockade that the World Bank says has brought Gaza's economy to crisis, leaving its 2 million people with limited access to health care, clean water and electricity.
Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been stalled since 2014.

The so-called CPMF tax introduced in 1993 as a temporary measure to subsidize Brazil's public healthcare system charged 0.38 percent on all financial transactions, including checks. It was in place until 2007. 
Bolsonaro's economic strategist Paulo Guedes, who has single-handedly won the market's confidence in his candidate - a seven-term congressman who has consistently voted against liberal economic policies - said he planned to reintroduce a similar tax, according to a story published on Wednesday by the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper. 
Bolsonaro has already said that if he wins, Guedes would become a ""super minister"" overseeing Brazil's economy.
The tax on financial transactions would be used to guarantee the solvency of Brazil's social security program while its unsustainable pension system gets overhauled, the newspaper said of the Guedes plan.
The story was immediately refuted by key members of Bolsonaro's team. 
""Bolsonaro is not studying the return of the CPMF tax as many media are saying!"" Bolsonaro's son Carlos tweeted.
Bolsonaro's running mate, General Hamilton Mourão, told Reuters in a telephone interview that he opposed reviving the tax, but said it was up to Bolsonaro to decide. 
Mourão later said at a campaign stop that restoring the tax would be ""shooting oneself in the foot.""
A message on Bolsonaro's Twitter account said his economic team was working to reduce the tax burden on Brazilians. ""Enough taxes is our motto,"" it said.
Brazil has the highest tax burden in Latin America, with taxation levels that are closer to developed nations.
Presidential candidates for the Oct. 7 vote have vowed not to raise taxes. But the need to reform a cumbersome tax system is espoused by most, along with overhauling a generous pension system that is considered the main cause of Brazil's unsustainable budget deficit.

Over what has become a key dinner in Austria for her plans to leave the European Union, May will also try to underline what Britain can still bring to the bloc, long after it leaves in March next year after almost half a century of the closest ties.
With just over six months until Britain leaves, May is trying to seal a deal before the end of the year and has long seen current security and justice cooperation as one of her strongest cards to try to win a favorable future trade deal.
Speaking to the other EU leaders at a summit in Salzburg, May will say the lessons that Britain and its partners have learned in tackling online radicalization should now be applied to illegal migration.
She will describe migration as a ""generational challenge"", her office said, and that, post-Brexit, Britain will remain fully committed to playing its part.
Migration has become a major test for the EU, which has struggled to agree a common stance on how to deal with the arrival of migrants from the Middle East and Africa onto its Mediterranean shores.
May will say it is too easy for traffickers and smugglers to advertise their services online, and will set out how Britain has referred 539 social media pages advertising people smuggling services for closure by Europol in the last year.

She will offer to share British expertise and put Britain at the forefront of a combined effort to work with social media platforms to prevent criminals exploiting their networks.

897,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Colombia's coca cultivation hits record in 2017: U.N.,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's acreage of coca, the raw material for cocaine, expanded 17 percent to hit a new record last year, the United Nations said on Wednesday, as the government mulls whether to restart aerial fumigation with the herbicide glyphosate.
The total area of the Andean nation under coca cultivation increased to 171,000 hectares (422,550 acres) by the end of 2017, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, due to increased productivity and growers eager to expand in the hope of getting more aid to switch to legal crops.
The figure is the largest since the U.N. began keeping records, it said, adding that potential cocaine production was 1,379 metric tons last year.
Colombia has long been ranked as the world's top producer of cocaine. In June, a U.S. government report said its potential cocaine output had risen to 921 metric tons in 2017.
President Ivan Duque, who took office last month, has said aerial fumigation with glyphosate could be restarted if the effort complies with conditions laid out by the country's Constitutional Court.
Use of the herbicide was suspended by previous President Juan Manuel Santos in 2015 after the World Health Organization linked it to cancer. 
In June, Santos authorized the use of glyphosate in fumigations using drones, saying they fly low enough to limit dangers associated with the herbicide.
But the Constitutional Court has said studies must be conducted on glyphosate and strict regulations put on its use, among other conditions, if spraying is to resume.
Duque said on Wednesday the government would implement a new strategy to fight drug trafficking soon.
""Our goal in the next four years is to have concrete results,"" he told journalists. ""So we can at least eradicate more than 70 percent of what we have today.""
Glyphosate is a key ingredient in the world's most widely-used herbicide, Roundup, produced by Bayer (DE:BAYGN) AG's  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) unit. Bayer denies allegations that glyphosate causes cancer.
Colombia has been plagued by violence associated with the drug trade for decades. Rebel groups, right-wing paramilitaries and armed gangs make billions of dollars moving cocaine overseas.
The government signed a peace accord in late 2016 with the Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group, which was heavily involved in coca production. But new armed groups are now fighting over lucrative growing and trafficking routes.

Between 2000 and 2015, the United States, the main destination for Colombian cocaine, gave the country some $10 billion to fight drug trafficking. U.S. aid now stands at about $400 million annually.

Mexicans stood silently in the street with their fists raised aloft just after 1:14 p.m. local time (1814), the moment a quake struck the capital city and surrounding states on Sept. 19 last year.
Quake rescue workers had used the gesture to request quiet as they listened for signs of life below the rubble of fallen buildings.
Just over a minute later, authorities activated quake alarms in Mexico City and office workers began carrying out practice runs for emergency evacuations of buildings. The timing of the drill brought back traumatic memories for many city residents, including children who were at school when the quake struck.
""My daughter came out crying last year, and I think she's going to be worried again today,"" said Adriana Guerrero, waiting for her child outside a school in the wealthy Polanco area of Mexico City as the children and teachers evacuated classrooms.
Even before the disaster last year, another anniversary on the same date had been engraved in the minds of older residents of the capital who remembered a massive earthquake that killed thousands of people in 1985.
The 7.1 magnitude quake hit central Mexico last year hours after a memorial evacuation drill. It killed 370 people, most of them in the capital. Tens of thousands of buildings were damaged, and dozens died as a school and offices collapsed.

The tremor shook the country just 12 days after a separate, more powerful earthquake struck off the southwest coast of the country, killing about 100 people.

Mnangagwa, elected in July in a vote ratified by the courts after an opposition challenge, is under pressure at home and abroad to differentiate his administration from that of his former mentor Mugabe, who was ousted in a bloodless coup in November.
Misheck Sibanda, chief secretary to the president, said Mnangagwa had retired nine senior government officials, including Tobaiwa Mudede, an abrasive lawyer-turned-bureaucrat who had served as registrar general since independence in 1980 and was until recently in charge of the voter register.
Mnangagwa also re-assigned 19 other top civil servants without giving them specific roles, including Willard Manungo the most senior bureaucrat in the finance ministry. His replacement is George Guvamatanga, a former managing director at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Bank Zimbabwe.
The 76-year-old president appointed 17 other permanent secretaries - the civil servants in charge of running the daily affairs of government ministries.
Mugabe's spokesman of 25 years George Charamba, who had continued in the role since first Mnangagwa took office in November, was promoted to deputy chief secretary in charge of presidential communications.

Charamba, who writes a weekly ghost column critical of government opponents in a state-owned daily paper, is known for his testy character especially by foreign journalists. His replacement is expected to be named soon.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Outgoing Democratic Republic of Congo president Joseph Kabila's preferred successor will face a credible election challenge in December from two opposition leaders, the final list of candidates published on Wednesday showed.
Kabila has ruled since his father's assassination in 2001. He agreed last month not to defy term limits by standing for re-election, opening the door to the Central African nation's first democratic transfer of power.
His announcement calmed tensions that have seen dozens of anti-Kabila demonstrators killed by security forces since he refused to step down when his constitutional mandate expired in December 2016.
Kabila is backing Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary in the long-delayed, Dec. 23 poll.
His biggest challengers are likely to be Felix Tshisekedi, the president of Congo's largest opposition party, and Vital Kamerhe, who placed third in the last election in 2011.
But in all 21 candidates have been approved for the single-round contest, including several other prominent Kabila critics, which risks diluting the opposition vote and boosting Ramazani's chances.
The authorities' exclusion from the race of other leading opposition figures, including former vice president Jean-Pierre Bemba and ex-provincial governor Moise Katumbi, has also raised questions about the election's fairness.
The opposition accuses Kabila's camp of plotting to rig the elections with untested electronic voting machines, a charge the ruling coalition rejects. 
In a rare opinion poll in July, Katumbi finished joint first with Tshisekedi on 19 percent of the vote. Bemba received 17 percent and Kamerhe got 9 percent.
Ramazani did not receive enough votes to figure in the results but is expected to now benefit from the ruling coalition's financial and institutional muscle.
Opposition leaders have repeatedly said they intend to coalesce behind a single candidate but have traditionally struggled to present a united front. In 2011, Kabila won with 49 percent of ballots cast as the opposition vote split. 
The final candidate list also includes former prime minister Samy Badibanga and long-time Kabila ally Tryphon Kin-Kiey. 
Bemba was disqualified by the constitutional court earlier this month over a witness tampering conviction while Katumbi was prevented from re-entering the country last month to register his candidacy after two years in exile. [nL8N1VP4C9]
The electoral commission also validated more than 15,000 candidacies for parliamentary elections due to take place the same day.

The government signed off on the consignment of four artillery positioning systems, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier wrote in a letter to lawmakers seen by Reuters. The vehicle-mounted systems can locate enemy fire, enabling accurate counter-strikes.
The weapons delivery is the first documented one to Riyadh since March, when Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition agreed to the Yemen-related ban.
A Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen's war in 2015 to restore the country's internationally-recognized government, ousted by the rebel Houthi group.
Germany is one of the world's five biggest arms exporters, according to the SIPRI research group, but weapons sales are a sensitive issue there due to the country's World War Two history.

908,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 02:13PM ET</span>",U.S. seeking to negotiate a treaty with Iran,"By Lesley Wroughton
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is seeking to negotiate a treaty with Iran to include Tehran's ballistic missile program and its regional behavior, the U.S. special envoy for Iran said on Wednesday ahead of U.N. meetings in New York next week. 
Iran has rejected U.S. attempts to hold high-level talks since President Donald Trump tore up a nuclear deal between Tehran and six world powers earlier this year. 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo listed a dozen demands in May that he said could make up a new agreement, although Hook's reference to a treaty, which would have to be approved by the U.S. Senate, appears to be a new focus.
""The new deal that we hope to be able to sign with Iran, and it will not be a personal agreement between two governments like the last one, we seek a treaty,"" envoy Brian Hook told an audience at the Hudson Institute think tank.
Among Pompeo's demands was the release of Americans jailed by Tehran, an end to its nuclear and missile programs and for Iran to withdraw its forces and end financial support for sides in the conflicts in Syria and Yemen.
But Hook acknowledged Iranian leaders have not been interested in talks despite statements by Trump this year that the administration was willing to meet.
The 2015 deal was an executive agreement that was not ratified by the U.S. Senate and covered only Iran's nuclear program. A treaty would require approval by the Senate. 
Some opponents of the nuclear agreement have argued that Obama's failure to seek Senate approval of the deal allowed Trump to unilaterally withdraw.
""They did not have the votes in the U.S. Senate so they found the votes in the U.N. Security Council. That is insufficient in our system of government if you want to have something enduring and sustainable,"" Hook said, adding that Washington hoped U.S. sanctions would force Tehran to negotiate.
Iran views the United States as acting in bad faith by withdrawing from a deal and has longed blamed Washington for stoking instability in the Middle East. It has said Trump's offer to negotiate contradicts his actions and accused Washington of trying to foment regime change.
Trump will chair a session on Iran during the U.N. General Assembly meetings in New York next week. In July, Trump said he was willing to meet Iran's leaders ""anytime they want"" prompting speculation that a meeting might take place at the U.N. meetings next week.
""The Ayatollah, the president and foreign minister have all indicated they are not interested in talking,"" Hook said, referring to Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, President Hassan Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.
""We respect that though that does not change our plans. We have a sanctions regime that is underway, stronger measures are yet to come,"" he added.
Hook said the administration was expanding its diplomatic efforts to ensure that purchases of Iranian oil are drastically reduced by Nov. 4 when Washington reimposes oil sanctions against Tehran.
Hook said Iran posed an international threat to peace and security that went beyond the six major powers that signs the initial nuclear deal. European and Asian countries have been trying to salvage the nuclear deal despite new U.S. sanctions against Tehran. 

""If we want to have a stable and prosperous Middle East it starts with constraining Iran,"" Hook said.

Moria, Greece's biggest migrant camp in a former military base on the island, is holding 9,000 people, nearly three times its capacity, according to the latest government data. 
Aerial footage obtained by Reuters shows several dozen tents have spilled over into an adjacent olive grove, where hundreds of asylum-seekers, most of them Afghan, live in grim conditions. 
Young children with muddied faces play among piles of rubbish and women wash clothes and plates in buckets of murky water. Others break off tree branches to shelter their tents from the elements.
""The situation is so bad here,"" said Ali, an Afghan asylum-seeker who arrived in Greece with his three children in August. ""Night is so bad ... my children cannot go to the toilet because everywhere it is dark here and we are in a forest.""

The European Parliament, in an unprecedented vote last week, backed sanctions against Hungary, accusing Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing government of flouting EU standards on democracy, civil rights and corruption.
This could theoretically result in Hungary losing its EU voting rights - but any one member state could veto such a move, and both Poland and the Czech Republic have already said they would do so. 
Krasimir Karakachanov, a member of the anti-immigrant United Patriots, junior partner in Bulgaria's ruling coalition, said the cabinet had unanimously agreed to forge a common position that would oppose any sanctions against Hungary.
""We think that this is a violation of the sovereignty of an equal member state of the European Union,"" Karakachanov told reporters after a cabinet meeting.
""Today it is Hungary, tomorrow it could be Poland, and one day it could be Bulgaria in the dock. Central and eastern European countries should act in solidarity and help each other because they have common problems,"" he said.
Poland is also being investigated by the EU over its record on democracy and the rule of law.
Bulgaria, although criticized by Brussels for failing to effectively impose the strict rule of law, is not facing any such investigation.
Its center-right prime minister, Boyko Borissov, a close ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the EU, has not commented publicly on the Hungarian investigation.
But Borissov's GERB party voted against the censure motion in the European Parliament last week. He needs the support of the nationalist United Patriots to stay in power, while Bulgaria is regularly criticized by the EU over its failure to tackle corruption and organized crime.
Like Hungary and other ex-communist states, Bulgaria has been critical of Merkel's decision to take in more than a million migrants, mostly Muslims fleeing conflicts in the Middle East, since 2015. 

Also like Hungary, Bulgaria has built a fence along its southern border - with Turkey - to deter illegal migrants trying to enter the EU.

EU leaders were meeting in the Austrian city of Salzburg later on Wednesday to tackle migration once again, an issue that has badly damaged their unity in recent years. 
They will seek more ways of reducing immigration and, right before chairing the talks, EU Council chairman Donald Tusk said progress had been made since migrant arrivals peaked in 2015. He said fewer than 100,000 migrants had crossed the Mediterranean to Europe without necessary documentation this year. 
""In fact, this is less than in the years before the migration crisis,"" Tusk said.
""I will call on EU leaders to stop the migration blame game. Despite aggressive rhetoric, things are moving in the right direction,"" he told reporters in Salzburg. 
""Instead of taking political advantage of the situation, we should focus on what works ... We can no longer be divided into those who want to solve the problem of illegal migrant flows and those who want to use it for political gain.""
More than a million migrants arrived from the tumultuous Middle East and impoverished Africa in 2015, stretching public services and leading to a rise in far-right anti-immigrant parties challenging liberal democracies around the EU. 
The EU has since struck deals with countries from Turkey to Lebanon to Libya, offering them money and aid in exchange for keeping a tighter lid on migration to Europe. It has also tightened its borders and made it harder to win asylum. 
Despite a steep drop in immigration numbers since 2015, however, political aftershocks are still reverberating with member states at loggerheads over how to distribute new arrivals and share the burden of integrating migrants already in the EU. 
Italy's firebrand far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, has excoriated the EU over its disarray on migration.

A majority of Europeans support taking in refugees although many disapprove of how the EU has handled a record influx, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center.

Israeli children rode freely on the main road that leads into the heart of Jerusalem, where there were similar scenes on the deserted highways west of the Old City.

The decades-old traditional driving ban is not dictated by law but is maintained out of deference for the holy day. Israeli Jews refrain from driving during the 25-hour holy period which this year began at dusk on Tuesday and ends after dark on Wednesday.
The days leading up to Yom Kippur are the busiest of the year for Israeli bicycle sellers and repairers, as children prepare for their big day of fun out in the fresh air when the weather is still warm.
Alongside the cyclists, scooters and pedestrians the occasional police car and ambulance could be seen driving slowly along highways, usually flashing their blue or red beacons to give warning of their approach.

Rescue services report several hundred cases of cyclists sustaining injuries during the day, but few of the casualties are considered serious.

PARIS (Reuters) - France will not name a new ambassador to Tehran before getting information from Iran following a foiled plot to bomb an Iranian opposition rally in Paris last June, French officials said on Wednesday.
An Iranian diplomat based in Austria and three other people were arrested on suspicion of plotting the attack on a meeting of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI).
Iran has said it had nothing to do with the plot, which it called a ""false flag"" operation staged by figures within the opposition group itself.
The incident has hit relations just as France and its European partners are seeking to salvage a 2015 nuclear agreement between Tehran and world powers. 
France's ambassador to Iran departed in the summer. Iran has also yet to replace its departed ambassador to Paris.
""We have a charge d'affaires today in Tehran and there is a high-level dialogue between French and Iranian authorities,"" said a French presidential source. 
""We are working together to bring to light what happened around this event ... I wouldn't say there is a direct link (in not appointing an ambassador), but Iran has promised to give us objective facts in the coming weeks that would allow us to pursue our diplomatic relationship as it is today."" 
A French diplomatic source said the nomination had indeed been suspended as a result of the alleged plot.
France's Foreign Ministry in August told its diplomats and officials to postpone non-essential travel to Iran indefinitely, citing the plot and a hardening of Tehran's attitude toward France, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.
President Emmanuel Macron is likely to discuss the issue with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani when they meet on Sept. 25 on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, the source said.
Along with Britain and Germany, France is trying save a 2015 agreement on Iran's nuclear program, which was thrown into disarray when U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the accord in May and re-imposed economic sanctions on Iran.
Even so, tensions between Paris and Tehran have grown in recent months as Macron and his government have become increasingly frustrated with Iran's activities in the Middle East region, in particular its ballistic missile program.

914,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>",Divisive Brazil election careens into 'dangerous' polarization,"By Brad Brooks and Anthony Boadle
SAO PAULO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's presidential campaign, already the most divisive since the end of military rule three decades ago, has become even more polarized, raising concerns about the future of the country's democracy.
Less than three weeks before the vote, polling shows that the middle has collapsed, with the electorate heading to either a left or right extreme.
On the right is poll-leading Jair Bolsonaro, a retired Army captain, who has emerged from a Sept. 6 assassination attempt more radical than ever. He said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) video viewed 7 million times by Wednesday morning that if he loses the election, it would be because the leftist Workers Party (PT) rigged the voting system. That jolted an already tense political landscape.
On the other side, the PT has called the election a fraud because its jailed founder and Brazil's most popular politician, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has not been allowed to run due to a corruption conviction. The party has made ""Free Lula"" its rallying cry.
The PT's stance has stoked concerns among a wide swath of voters, who blame the party for widespread political corruption and fear that if the PT's candidate, Fernando Haddad, wins he would pardon Lula. Haddad on Tuesday flatly denied he would do that, though he said the former president would be an essential adviser to his government, even from jail. 
Lost in the increasingly toxic atmosphere ahead of the Oct. 7 first-round vote is any chance Brazil's election will unite a deeply split country, raising the risk that the next government will be paralyzed by infighting and opposition, unable to make headway against the dual economic and political crises facing Brazil, the world's eighth-largest economy. 
""Many thought that by the time we got close to the election, some middle ground would be found, and that is not what we are seeing,"" said Monica de Bolle, director of Latin American studies program at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. 
Instead, Bolsonaro, 63, is heading to a likely Oct. 28 runoff vote against Haddad, 55, a matchup that polls show is deadlocked. The election has become ""very dangerous,"" de Bolle said.
That is mainly because Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly praised Brazil's military regime, and his running mate, Hamilton Mourão, a retired Army general, have openly talked ""about constraining civil liberties and rewriting the Constitution in a authoritarian way,"" de Bolle said. 
Mourão has said the armed forces should carry out a coup if the country's judiciary cannot end political corruption,
""They are not shying away from saying these things openly and they are not being criticized for saying them,"" she added.
EASY ANSWERS
Amid rising crime and continued revelations of corruption, the Bolsonaro ticket offers a simple formula for voters, while enticing powerful business sectors with promises of liberal economic policies and, above all, stopping the return of Lula's party and its state-led plans for the economy.
""What I find really surprising is that there is a large segment of the Brazilian population, the elite, the people who should know better, who are basically throwing risk aside and saying 'you know, I don't care. I just don't want the PT back in power,'"" de Bolle said. 
That is seen in the open arms that influential Brazilian economic groups are offering to Bolsonaro's team. 
On Monday, Mourão, who last week said Brazil's Constitution could be re-written without direct input from voters, addressed a luncheon of Sao Paulo business leaders, who interrupted his 40-minute address on several occasions with applause. 
When asked during a panel discussion if he believed in the democratic process, Mourão said ""if I were anti-democratic, I would not be participating in this election. I'd be home polishing my .45 pistol and waiting for better days."" 
The line drew laughter from the crowd.
Asked about Bolsonaro's allegation the PT would try to rig the voting system to win, Mourão said that ""you have to take into account he is a man who practically died just over a week ago.""
However, Carlos Melo, a political scientist with Insper, a Sao Paulo business school, said Bolsonaro has raised that concern before and is doing so now as a ""preemptive measure ... anticipating any defeat so he can question the results.""
""Bolsonaro is a political actor who has never fully supported Brazilian democracy,"" Melo said. ""His choice of Mourão as a running mate obviously adds another element that puts pressure on our democracy."" 
For Sergio Praça, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a leading Brazilian university, the most present danger would be any attempt by Haddad to pardon Lula. 
""Until a few days ago, I would have said that any threat against Brazilian democracy was a joke,"" he said. ""Now, there is a tense vibe. The rhetoric from Bolsonaro's running mate is highly unusual, it is not normal. 

""But what worries me the most is any pardon of Lula. Not because I want to see Lula in prison for a long time, but because it would be a serious blow against the judicial system that would provoke enough support within civil society for a military coup.""

The right-wing government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban is one of the strongest opponents of immigration into the European Union. It has built a fence along Hungary's southern borders and made it very difficult for refugees to apply for asylum. 
A U.N. rights watchdog, which reviewed Hungary's record, urged the government in April to crack down on hate speech by politicians against Roma, Muslims and other minorities, and to repeal a law allowing migrants to be deported without a chance to seek asylum.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, in an angry and apparently improvised speech on Wednesday, appeared to take aim at the panel composed of 18 independent experts, saying ""they should not be independent from the truth"".
""Recently, unfortunately, some U.N. officials started to spread lies against and about my country,"" he told the U.N. Human Rights Council, where Hungary is currently among the 47 member states of the Geneva forum.
Szijjarto, who headed Hungary's delegation to the review by the separate watchdog in March-April, noted that Orban's conservative Fidesz party had subsequently won re-election for a third consecutive term with a large majority.
""U.N. officials would like to force on us impossible things, to allow illegal migrants to enter our country. They say that migration is a fundamental human right, which is a lie,"" he said.

John Fisher, Geneva director of the New York-based activist group Human Rights Watch, tweeted: ""#Hungary unhinged. Foreign Minister embarrasses himself and his country by launching anti-migrant, anti-NGO, anti-#UN tirade.""

916,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",Peru president confident Congress to back him in high-stakes vote,"LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's centrist President Martin Vizcarra said on Wednesday he was confident lawmakers would renew their confidence in his Cabinet and avert a situation that could lead to the dissolution of his Cabinet and Congress.
In a late-night message to the nation on Sunday, Vizcarra called for a vote of confidence in his Cabinet over four proposed anti-graft bills that he has accused lawmakers of stalling. 
Under Peru's constitution, if Congress issues a vote of no-confidence, Vizcarra must replace his Cabinet. But, because Congress has already voted out one Cabinet in this government, he would also be authorized to dissolve Congress in response.
With their jobs on the line, lawmakers passed one of the four bills on Tuesday and the president of Congress said the remaining three could be approved in early October, in time to put them to voters in a referendum in December.
I have ""total confidence in receiving the vote of confidence today,"" Vizcarra told journalists outside the presidential palace surrounded by his Cabinet. ""The four bills must be approved. That's what I asked for in a message to the nation on Sunday and I ratify that again today.""
If Vizcarra succeeds, the vote could give him a victory over Popular Force, the conservative opposition party that helped topple his predecessor, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.
Kuczynski resigned in a graft scandal on the eve of his near-certain impeachment in March. Vizcarra, then the vice president, took office to replace him.
Popular Force, which has a majority in Congress and is led by twice-defeated presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori, said on Tuesday that it had not yet take a position on whether to renew its confidence in Vizcarra's Cabinet. Popular Force lawmakers with the party have described the move as unconstitutional and authoritarian.
Prime Minister Cesar Villanueva formally asked Congress to support Vizcarra's anti-graft push in a plenary session on Wednesday, reminding lawmakers of widespread anger at the political class following back-to-back corruption scandals in the past two years.
""It's we, the politicians, who must make decisions to solve these kind of problems,"" Villanueva said. ""We're not betting on partial solutions.""

Vizcarra's proposals include a new system for selecting judges, a return to a bicameral Congress, stricter campaign financing rules and a ban on the re-election of lawmakers. He pitched the reforms following an influence-peddling scandal involving judges, lawmakers and businessmen that triggered street protests and diminished trust in public institutions.

The money was channeled into the social cash transfer scheme, a donor-supported program under which the government relays money to vulnerable households in rural areas.
Lungu's spokesman Amos Chanda said Olipa Phiri had been made Community Development and Social Welfare Minister, replacing Emerine Kabanshi.
""The new minister has been given a clear mission to get down to work and clean up the mess that has been identified in the administration of the social cash transfer,"" Chanda said.
Kabanshi has not made any public comment on the affair, and Reuters was unable to reach her by phone.
Chanda said Phiri would work with the auditor-general and other investigative agencies to ensure that accountability was restored.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the state-owned company engaged by the government to distribute the money had used part of it to pay its retirees and refurbish offices, Chanda said.
Chanda said on Tuesday that Lungu had ordered an inquiry four months ago into possible misuse of the aid funds since 2012, and a number of suspects would be prosecuted.

BERLIN (Reuters) - A clumsy compromise to end a row over the fate of Germany's spy chief has exposed a cruel fact: the parties in Chancellor Angela Merkel's right-left coalition are loveless partners in a dysfunctional relationship that none of them can afford to quit.
The coalition leaders sought on Tuesday to end a scandal that had rumbled on for 11 days by agreeing to replace the head of the BfV domestic intelligence agency, who has faced accusations of harboring far-right sympathies.
Their solution - promoting spymaster Hans-Georg Maassen to a better paid position at the Interior Ministry - has only inflamed tensions among the rank-and-file of the ruling parties, whose leaders are united by fear more than collective purpose.
The scandal, the latest in a series of setbacks to shake the six-month-old coalition, threatens to erode further the German ruling elite's authority and may point to years of policy drift just as Germany and Europe are crying out for firm leadership.
Polls show both Merkel's conservative bloc and its junior coalition partner, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), would bleed votes to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the ecologist Greens in any new elections.
That leaves their leaders hanging on to the awkward right-left 'grand coalition' as Merkel, serving her fourth and likely final term as chancellor, tries to secure her legacy as a stateswoman and the SPD struggles to remain relevant to voters.
""The grand coalition is like a dead marriage where the spouses have too many intertwined assets to be able to separate without heavy losses,"" said Josef Joffe, publisher-editor of weekly Die Zeit.
""They would be trounced in snap elections. Nor can they recruit more docile partners among the four opposition parties.""
The Maassen scandal comes only two months after Merkel closed a painful row with her Bavarian CSU allies on immigration - an issue that goes back to her 2015 decision to leave open Germany's borders to refugees fleeing war in the Middle East.
The SPD had wanted Maassen removed after he questioned the authenticity of video footage showing far-right radicals hounding migrants in the eastern German city of Chemnitz.
But Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, leader of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), sister party of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), stood behind Maassen.
By promoting the spymaster to the post of state secretary in his Interior Ministry, Seehofer found a solution that satisfied the SPD's demand for Maassen's removal from the BfV but left the coalition looking lame.
""The only thing that is still grand in this coalition is the absolute determination to carry on muddling through,"" mass-selling daily Bild wrote in an editorial.
""PERMANENT CRISIS MODE""
The grand coalition only took office in March, nearly six months after last year's election, as there was effectively no other viable governing option following the collapse of talks between Merkel's conservatives and two smaller parties.
After the Maassen deal, pressure is growing in the SPD for its leaders to reconsider the coalition or else deliver results that will win back working class voters who are turning to the far right or left, and middle class voters moving to the Greens.
""Patience in the SPD with this grand coalition is extremely thin,"" said Ralf Stegner, a senior SPD official.
Even SPD Secretary General Lars Klingbeil questioned Maassen's promotion, adding: ""We must finally get out of this permanent crisis mode.""
SPD leader Andrea Nahles said the party should remain in the coalition but added that Seehofer's decision to transfer Maassen to his ministry was a ""further burden"" for cooperation.
In a letter to party members, she added: ""The SPD shouldn't sacrifice this government because Horst Seehofer employs a civil servant whom we consider to be unsuitable.""
Merkel's 2015 decision on refugees has proved to be the defining moment of her leadership and one that still haunts her as the CSU, fearful of losing votes to the AfD in Bavaria's state election on Oct. 14, tries to sound tough on immigration.
The CSU is likely to lose its absolute majority in Bavaria, which could make it an even more difficult partner for Merkel.
Nationally, the conservative bloc is polling around 30 percent, down from 33 percent in last September's election. The SPD is on about 18 percent, down from 20.5 percent. The AfD is polling around 15 percent, with the Greens close behind.
""So it is in (Merkel's) interests to keep up the image of a coalition that is functional and capable of acting,"" said Gero Neugebauer, political scientist at Berlin's Free University.

""She is managing to do that less and less,"" he said, adding that even after the Maassen deal conflicts between the coalition parties were ""bubbling away like lava in a volcano"".

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani court on Wednesday ordered the release from jail of ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter, suspending prison sentences a lower court handed down in July over the purchase of upscale apartments in London.
Sharif's supporters cheered as the Islamabad High Court suspended the 10-year jail term of the three-time premier, who was once the favorite of Pakistan's powerful generals but has since fallen out and clashed with the military.
The ruling comes almost two months after Sharif's party lost a general election to the party of new Prime Minister Imran Khan. Sharif's party and others allege the July 25 polls were rigged to favor Khan, seen to be close to the army.
The court also freed Sharif's daughter and political heir Maryam, who was jailed for seven years on corruption charges relating to the family's acquisition of the London flats.
""The prosecution has failed to show the properties belong to Nawaz Sharif,"" Justice Athar Minallah told the court. ""It also failed to prove how was Maryam Nawaz sentenced under the same charge sheet which convicted Nawaz Sharif."" 
The convictions are still under appeal with the same Islamabad High Court, but the judge said they should be freed immediately while the case continues.
""Justice has been served, and I congratulate Nawaz Sharif's supporters,"" former Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif, a staunch Sharif ally, said outside the courtroom, where supporters chanted pro-Sharif slogans.
OFFSHORE ALLEGATION
Sharif was ousted and disqualified from holding office by the Supreme Court in July 2017 and jailed earlier this year in absentia. He was arrested on July 13 upon returning from London.
The case against Sharif stemmed from 2016 Panama Papers revelations that showed his family owned the London apartments through offshore companies. Maryam was convicted for concealing ownership of the properties. They both deny wrongdoing.
Sharif's release comes a week after the death aged 68 of Kulsoom, his wife of 47 years, who had been battling cancer in a London hospital. The former First Lady's funeral in Pakistan, for which the family were briefly paroled, gripped the nation.
Sharif has repeatedly called the cases against him politically motivated, suggesting collusion between the military and courts to destabilize his Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party and throw him out of power.
Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), the ruling party led by former cricketer Khan, said the judiciary was independent and the cases would continue.
""The Sharif family still has not proven where the billions of rupees came from for their property,"" said Fawad Chauhdry, the government's information minister, according to PTI's official Twitter account.
In opposition, Khan was a vocal supporter of the legal cases that saw the Supreme Court removed Sharif from office.
Sharif, a political survivor, was previously jailed after the 1999 coup by military ruler Pervez Musharraf. Sharif later went into exile after striking a deal with the military and returned in 2007 to contest an election after Musharraf stepped down in the face of mass protests.

His impending release comes as Khan is making his first official overseas trip to Saudi Arabia, the country that gave Sharif shelter after the 1999 coup, where he is reportedly seeking financial help to stave off the likelihood of another IMF bailout.

SALZBURG, Austria (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May received less than glowing praise for her Brexit plan on Wednesday, with top EU official Donald Tusk saying Britain must rework its proposals for Northern Ireland and trade.
Hours before the British prime minister was due to try to sell her plan to the other European Union leaders, summit chairman Tusk repeated criticism of her proposals for future customs arrangements and for the border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.
May has shown little sign of backing away from her ""Chequers"" plan, and repeated her aims in a carefully placed article in a German newspaper on the eve of the two-day EU summit in Salzburg, Austria.
But Tusk was clear - her customs proposals and those aimed at preventing a hard border on the island of Ireland would have to be reworked. Earlier, EU negotiator Michel Barnier signaled he was ready to address Britain's border concerns.
""The Brexit negotiations are entering their decisive phase. Various scenarios are still possible today but I'd like to stress that some of Prime Minister May's proposals from Chequers indicated positive evolution in the UK's approach,"" Tusk told a news conference.
""On other issues, such as the Irish question, or the framework for economic cooperation, the UK's proposals will need to be reworked and further negotiated.""
A British government source said London welcomed the EU's commitment to finding a solution to the border issue, but could not accept any proposal that would effectively move the customs frontier into the Irish Sea, separating Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom.
With just over six months to go till Britain leaves the EU, time is pressing and both sides are keen to secure some kind of deal before the end of the year and ease concerns over a disorderly Brexit, which could push the economy into a downturn.
Writing in Germany's Die Welt, May said the two sides were ""near to achieving the orderly withdrawal that is an essential basis for building a close future partnership"".
""To come to a successful conclusion, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to do the same. 
""With goodwill and determination on both sides we can avoid a disorderly exit and find new ways of working together.""
'SOUND OF MUSIC'
At a summit dinner at the Felsenreitschule theater -- known to film fans for a scene in the musical 'The Sound of Music' -- May will make another pitch for support for her Chequers plan, named after her country residence where a deal was hashed out with her ministers earlier this year. 
Then she will be out of the room on Thursday afternoon when the other 27 leaders discuss her Brexit proposals. 
Tusk said he would call an additional summit in mid-November to seal any deal with Britain.
While both sides have been making positive noises, how to keep an open border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic remains one of the biggest obstacles.
""On Brexit, it's very difficult. We have nothing on Ireland,"" Jean Asselborn, Luxembourg's foreign minister, told Reuters.
Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which backs May's minority government in Westminster, criticized Barnier's ideas for handling customs crossing the Irish frontier, saying they would still mean an unacceptable border between the province and the rest of the United Kingdom.
The government source said: ""We have been very clear that what we cannot accept is Northern Ireland being separated off from the UK customs territory."" 
But EU officials are minded not to paint May into a corner, aware that she faces increasing opposition to her plans in her Conservative Party, and needs a victory of sorts to persuade a reluctant parliament to back a deal.

May has told lawmakers that they will vote either for a Chequers-based deal or to leave without an agreement. Mel Stride, a junior treasury minister, said pro-Brexit and pro-EU lawmakers could usher in a second referendum on EU membership if they reject her plan.

At a time when anger over migration has fueled a rise in eurosceptic, anti-immigrant parties across Europe, the survey, conducted between May and July of this year, showed that over 80 percent of adults in Spain, the Netherlands, Germany and Sweden favor taking in refugees who are fleeing violence and war.
At over 70 percent, support was also high in France and the United Kingdom. Even in Greece and Italy, the main entry points for migrants into Europe, the survey showed that a majority of respondents still favor accepting refugees.
The European country with the lowest acceptance was Hungary, at 32 percent, well below Poland at 49 percent. 
The survey also showed many Europeans are critical of how the EU has handled the influx.
The crisis of 2015 exposed deep divisions within the EU, with frontline countries like Italy and Greece frustrated with eastern European countries that have refused to accept refugees, and others, including Sweden and Germany, taking on a disproportionately large share.
Some 92 percent of Greeks, 78 percent of Italians and 66 percent of Germans and British expressed disapproval with the EU's handling of the issue.

Outside of Europe, Mexico, Canada and Australia all showed high refugee acceptance rates of over 70 percent, while the United States and Japan both stood at 66 percent.

The homecoming of Robert Kyagulanyi, a pop star and opposition lawmaker, could present a significant challenge to Museveni, who has ruled since 1986. 
Kyagulanyi, 36, attracted a youth following through songs critical of Museveni and his prominence rose due to an incident in August in which his driver was shot dead and he was detained and charged with treason over what authorities said was the stoning of Museveni's convoy.
He said in a tweet on Wednesday he was ""headed home"" and showed a picture of himself at an airport holding a walking stick. 
Police said they had received information that supporters of Kyagulanyi, also known as Bobi Wine, planned to stage rallies and processions on his return but had not sought permission.
""As a result, they (the rallies) are unlawful and would disrupt normal business activities,"" a police statement said.
Kyagulanyi has pleaded not guilty to treason charges. 
He said he was beaten with an iron bar in detention in northern Uganda. The government denies that he was mistreated. 
Kyagulanyi's case sparked protests in Uganda's capital Kampala and drew international condemnation from the government's major backers including the EU and the U.S. The Pentagon has donated equipment and weapons to the unit of the Ugandan military accused by Kyagulanyi of torturing him. 

In a statement on Tuesday five U.S. legislators said they were ""gravely concerned"" by the torture of the legislators and their supporters and described it as ""unacceptable"". Five legislators in all were detained, two say they were badly beaten and all say they were mistreated.

The security services had ruthlessly clamped down on independent political, social and cultural spaces, Amnesty said.
""These measures, more extreme than anything seen in former President Hosni Mubarak's repressive 30-year rule, have turned Egypt into an open-air prison for critics,"" it said.
Sisi's supporters maintain the president, who was reelected in March, has been trying to combat an Islamist insurgency and restore order to the country following years of chaos after Arab Spring demonstrations forced Mubarak to step down in 2011.
They say that Sisi has improved security since 2013, when as army chief he ousted Islamist President Mohamed Mursi following mass protests against his rule.
Among those arrested were at least 35 people held on charges of ""unauthorized protest"" and ""joining a terrorist group"" after a peaceful protest against metro fare increases, and comics and satirists who posted commentary online, Amnesty said. 
They also include prominent figures and possible presidential contenders, such as former military chief of staff Sami Anan and former presidential contender Abdel Moneim Abol Fotouh, as well as former state auditor Hesham Genena.
Amnesty said at least 28 journalists were also among those detained since December 2017. 
""President al-Sisi's administration is punishing peaceful opposition and political activists with spurious counter-terrorism legislation and other vague laws that define any dissent as a criminal act,"" Bounaim said.

929,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",Prominent British Conservative distances himself from Steve Bannon,"By Mark Hosenball
LONDON (Reuters) - One of the leading British politicians pushing for a sharp exit from the European Union, Jacob Rees-Mogg, says he has no interest in joining a campaign to disrupt EU operations organized by former Trump White House advisor Steve Bannon.
Rees-Mogg, whose image as an old-fashioned, unashamedly ""posh"" Conservative has endeared him to many voters disillusioned with more modern-looking politicians, said he had met Bannon only once, in 2017. 
""Meeting someone does not mean you're endorsing them,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
""He is a very well informed man,"" Rees-Mogg said of Bannon, but added: ""We just had a discussion on world affairs. His world view is not my world view.""
Rees-Mogg, chair of the European Research Group of anti-EU Members of Parliament, is a leading light of the staunchly anti-EU wing of Theresa May's party that is urging the prime minister to drop her ""soft Brexit"" strategy which would maintain many of Britain's close ties to the bloc.
He said he had had no contact with Bannon since the one meeting in 2017 and had no interest in supporting a Brussels-based, Europe-wide ""Movement"" that Bannon is putting together to elect right-wing nationalist and populist members in European Parliament elections next May.
In a telephone interview on Wednesday, Bannon praised Rees-Mogg as a ""very important"" British leader. 
But he said that as it appeared certain that Britain is leaving the EU, he and his advisors, including British European Parliament member Nigel Farage, decided some time ago not to involve Britain in The Movement. 
Bannon, who addressed a conference of France's far-right National Front in March, said he planned to speak at an populist gathering this weekend in Rome where Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, who recently endorsed Bannon's Movement, will also speak. 
Before returning to the United States to help support pro-Trump candidates in Congressional elections, Bannon said he hoped to check in with other European leaders who might be interested in joining his campaign. Such figures are likely to include Hungarian Prime Minster Viktor Orban, Bannon's associates have said.
Rees-Mogg is one of three British Conservatives Bannon identified as political contacts in a recent Reuters interview https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-politics-bannon/ex-trump-strategist-bannon-targets-britain-in-anti-eu-campaign-idUKKBN1KH260.
A spokesman for Environment Secretary Michael Gove, also identified by Bannon as a member of a ""deep talent bench"" of potential anti-EU Conservatives, said Gove had met Bannon briefly only once and that two meetings to discuss U.S. politics had been explored but never took place. 
During a visit to London in July, Bannon said he had spoken by phone and ""texted a lot"" with former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, seen as the most likely figure to challenge May's leadership. Johnson has not responded to requests for comment on his contacts with Bannon.
Rees-Mogg said that he did not regard himself as aligned with anti-EU forces on continental Europe. 
""What's going on on the continent is very different"" than what is happening in Britain, he said.

He said that despite calls from some anti-Brexit politicians for a second referendum on Britain leaving the European Union, ""I think there would be real anger"" if significant moves were made to reverse or stop Brexit.

Cheap, homemade liquor is popular among poor, migrant workers in Muslim-majority Malaysia, which has high taxes on alcohol. 
A total of 57 cases of methanol poisoning had been reported in Kuala Lumpur, the capital, and its surrounding state of Selangor, Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said. 
""The number of cases is expected to increase as more patients come in for treatment,"" he told a news conference in the administrative capital of Putrajaya. 
Methanol, an alcohol compound used in making spurious liquor, is harmless in tiny amounts but lethal in larger concentrations. 
Five Malaysians were among those affected, while the rest were foreigners from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Myanmar and Nepal, Dzulkefly added.
Authorities had tested several types of alcoholic drinks to find some samples contained methanol in higher proportions than authorized, he said.
""We are very concerned because it comes in batches... people are resorting to cheap, compounded hard liquor,"" Dzulkefly said.
Police arrested seven people in raids on 12 sites where they seized nearly 3,000 bottles and cans of whisky and beer, in a bid to identify the contaminated drinks and curb the outbreak, Selangor police chief Mazlan Mansor said in a statement.
Police are investigating the deaths as culpable homicide, which carries a jail term of up to 10 years, a fine, or both. 
In neighboring Indonesia, also a Muslim-majority country, more than 50 people died in April after consuming homemade alcohol tainted with ingredients such as mosquito repellent.

931,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 07:45AM ET</span>",Nigerian military struggles against Islamic State in West Africa: sources,"By Paul Carsten
ABUJA (Reuters) - Islamist militants have killed hundreds of soldiers in attacks in northeastern Nigeria in recent weeks, security and military sources say, forcing a turnaround in the course of an insurgency which the government has frequently claimed to have vanquished.
The fatigued, ill-equipped government troops have reached breaking point, they said.
The setback in the war against Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) and the Boko Haram insurgency from which it split in 2016 comes as President Muhammadu Buhari seeks a second term in elections next February. 
(GRAPHIC: Islamist insurgencies in Nigeria - http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/NIGERIA-SECURITY/010062F043W/NIGERIA-SECURITY.jpg)
Buhari came to power in 2015 on a promise to defeat Boko Haram, and security has once again emerged as a main campaign issue.
In the past three weeks, according to military and security sources, ISWA killed 48 soldiers at a military base and, in a separate attack, left 32 dead in Gudumbali - a town to which thousands of refugees were ordered to return in June.
""The situation in the northeast is deteriorating,"" said one security source, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""They are running out of weapons, ammo and basic equipment. They are exhausted.""
Now, ISWA is winning almost all its battles with the military, security sources said.
That marks a contrast with the situation in early 2015 when the Nigerian army, backed by troops from neighboring countries, pushed Boko Haram off a swathe of land that the insurgents controlled. 
Before the insurgency, Nigeria's northeast, sitting in the arid Sahel that skirts the Sahara's southern border, had for centuries been a hub of cross-continental trade through the desert and one of the country's agricultural breadbaskets. 
ISWA's influence extends from the Lake Chad region, including in Niger and Chad itself, and stretches about 100 miles into the Nigerian states of Borno and Yobe, where government has in many areas all but vanished after a decade of conflict. It was not immediately clear how control of that territory has changed in recent months. 
MILITARY DENIES
A military spokesman denied the army was losing most of its clashes with ISWA.
""It's not true,"" said Brigadier General John Agim, adding that no soldiers had died at Gudumbali.
Agim declined to show battle reports or comment on the rest of the situation, other than saying the military did not have enough equipment.
In one of the army's biggest defeats since Buhari came to power, an ISWA attack on a base in July killed at least 100 soldiers, according to people familiar with the matter. Many of the dead were interred in a mass burial, two sources said.
Other grueling battles have been fought - at least 45 soldiers killed in Gajiram in June, scores dead and missing after a convoy ambush in Boboshe in July, and 17 killed in Garunda in August. These are just some of the recent attacks, according to military and security personnel, that are taking a heavy toll on the military.
With each victory, ISWA gets stronger, collecting weapons, ammunition and vehicles abandoned by fleeing troops. Its tactics have also improved, using trucks mounted with heavy guns to pin down ill-equipped troops, as well as suicide-bombing vehicles.
""SITTING DUCKS""
""The military are a bit like sitting ducks, waiting for a very mobile and versatile enemy to strike at a weak point or another,"" said Vincent Foucher, who studies Boko Haram at the French National Centre for Science Research.
The military has kept details of its most recent challenges and defeats close, rarely acknowledging them or any loss of life, say security sources who have sought briefings.
Buhari's administration and the military continue to issue statements about victories against an insurgency aimed at creating an Islamic caliphate that dates back to 2009. Normality is returning to the northeast, it says.
""The country has been stable for the past three years,"" Defence Minister Mansur Dan Ali told Reuters last month.
However, the minister, discussing the Jilli attack, acknowledged that a strong and well-equipped insurgent force was capable of wiping out as many as 200 soldiers.
""A CRISIS OF MORALE""
Soldiers have become terrified of the insurgents, afraid to leave their bases, said a security source and a diplomat. While hundreds have died recently, hundreds more have deserted.
One retired general, speaking on condition of anonymity, described ""a crisis of morale,"" linking the frequent allegations of human rights abuses - rape, torture, shake-downs and extra-judicial killing - to broken spirits. 
The Nigerian military denies such accusations, though it set up a panel last year to probe allegations. Its findings have not been made public.
Last month, Nigerian special forces mutinied at an airport, refusing to be deployed after learning that after years in the northeast they were being rotated to another, more dangerous part of the region.
""Many of our troops have been in the theater for over two years,"" said one captain. ""They don't know how their families, their wives and children, are.""
Some soldiers said though they do get a few days of leave, it is often barely enough time to go from the field to their families before they must return.
Others said their wages and rations are often embezzled by their commanders, there is too little equipment, and many vehicles are broken and gathering rust. One said his men had to buy blankets from refugees for 300 naira ($1) each to keep warm.
The United States, Britain and France support the military, mostly through training and information-sharing, but it has struggled to secure arms supplies due to human rights concerns.

The United States and Nigeria this year finalised a $500-million deal for 12 Super Tucano fighter planes. British Prime Miniser Theresa May, on a visit to Nigeria last month, promised to increase military support in the war against the Islamists.

934,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>",Calls grow for U.N. action on China's Muslim 're-education camps',"By Stephanie Nebehay
GENEVA (Reuters) - France and Germany have called on China to close ""re-education camps"" in its restive far western region of Xinjiang where up to one million Uighurs and other Muslims are thought to be held for political indoctrination as pressure grows for UN action.
Reports of mass detentions and strict surveillance of the Turkic minority in Xinjiang have sparked a growing international outcry since coming to light last month.
Beijing says Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists. Officials deny mistreating Muslims there, instead saying they are putting some people through ""vocational"" style courses to prevent militancy spreading. 
China has blamed a group called the East Turkestan Islamic Movement for many of the attacks in recent years in Xinjiang, though some experts have questioned whether the group exists in any coherent form. 
The calls by European powers at the U.N. Human Rights Council on Tuesday coincided with the first side-event held on the politically sensitive issue.
""What we are seeing now in East Turkestan is more than just repression, it is an intentional campaign of assimilation by the Chinese government targeting the Uighur identity,"" Dolkun Isa, president of the exiled World Uyghur Congress, told the panel.
""Everything that makes us unique, our language, our culture, our religion - is under attack... Every Uighur family in the diaspora has a family member detained in the camps,"" he said.
""Mass imprisonment of more than one million people cannot be justified on any grounds,"" Isa said. ""U.N. member states have an absolute obligation to act immediately.""
Inmates include his brother and at least 56 professors at Xinjiang University, he said.
""SOCIAL RE-ENGINEERING""
Adrian Zenz is a German academic and expert on Chinese minority policy whose research is based on government documents and accounts of visitors to the remote region.
""We can say this appears to be the most intensive social 
re-engineering effort of the Chinese state since the Cultural Revolution,"" he said.
""In Xinjiang we are looking at a minimum of several hundred thousand, possibly over one million in possibly over 1,000 to 1,200 facilities,"" he said.
Zenz based his findings on satellite imagery, government procurement bids for building internment facilities, and recruitment notices for Mandarin teachers.
""The aim is political indoctrination, changing people, actually changing the hearts, minds and souls you could say.""
U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet called on China last week to allow in monitors after the ""deeply disturbing"" allegations emerged.
But there appears to be little appetite among states for launching a U.N. probe, said John Fisher of Human Rights Watch.
""In similar circumstances in other countries, it would not be at all unwarranted for violations on this scale to be met with calls for a commission of inquiry, a fact-finding mission, a special rapporteur,"" he said.
""Because it is China, states' voices are muted.""

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan police and volunteer groups of armed civilians tightened controls across the capital Kabul on Wednesday ahead of Ashura, the holiest day of the Shi'ite Muslim calendar, following a series of attacks on Shi'ite targets by Islamic State militants.
Armed men stood at key points in areas like Dasht-e Barchi, a zone in western Kabul where many members of the mainly Shi'ite Hazara minority live and where some 20 people were killed in a suicide attack on a wrestling club two weeks ago.
For Shi'ites, Ashura, on the 10th day of the month of Muharram, commemorates the martyrdom of Hussein, one of the grandsons of the Prophet Mohammad, and is marked by large public processions that have been targeted by attackers in the past.
""If my life is needed, I will not hesitate for the safety of our people,"" said Ghulam Yahya, a 22 year-old standing guard with an AK-47 automatic rifle.
""This gun was provided by the government but there are many people who voluntarily came out with their private weapons even with hunting guns to assist our security forces to assure our people's safety,"" he said.
No up-to-date census data exists for Afghanistan but different estimates put the size of the Shi'ite community at between 10-20 percent of the total population, mostly Persian-speaking Hazaras and Tajiks.
Afghanistan, a largely Sunni Muslim country, had not suffered the sectarian violence seen in countries like Iraq but hundreds of Shi'ites have been killed over recent years in attacks on shrines and other sites.
Reports that the government had distributed 500 weapons to Hazara groups for self-defense have fueled worries, even among some Hazaras, about the potential for armed private groups to undermine the rule of law.
A senior official in the interior ministry denied the government had handed out weapons to Hazara groups but said security forces and the intelligence service were stepping up controls to head off any attack.
On Tuesday, officials said they had arrested 26 suspected militants from Islamic State, the Sunni militant group which has said its attacks on Shi'ite targets are retaliation for support it says is given to Iran by Afghan Shi'ites.
Arif Rahmani, a Hazara member of parliament, said the task of protecting the roughly 400 Shi'ite mosques in Kabul alone would far exceed the reach of any volunteer force but he said the government had no choice but to allow self-defense groups.
However, he said they should be incorporated into the regular security forces. ""Powers for public protection have to be under the law.""

936,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 07:22AM ET</span>",Greenland and the hunt for better climate science,"By Alister Doyle, Elizabeth Culliford and Lucas Jackson
GREENLAND (Reuters) - Flying over eastern Greenland, the NASA scientists stared down from a Gulfstream jet as it followed the precise course they had flown in previous years - using radar to map the loss of ice.
“In the tube,” flight engineer David Elliott said as the team locked into their route over the ice sheet covering 80 percent of the world’s largest island. Out the window, massive chunks of broken ice looked like salt flakes on the water.
The March mission was part of NASA’s Oceans Melting Greenland (OMG) project, a five-year, $30 million effort aimed at improving sea level rise projections by understanding how warming oceans are melting ice sheets from below - the most ambitious research on the subject to date.
Rising seas threaten low-lying cities, islands and industries worldwide. But projections for how high and how soon the rise will come vary wildly in part because scientists lack clarity on how fast warming oceans are melting polar ice sheets. The uncertainty confounds the preparations of governments and businesses and fuels the arguments of climate-change skeptics.
(For additional stories, graphics and videos from the Project Greenland interactive series, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2xvdzOS )
A draft report by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), for example, predicts that seas are likely to rise between 33 centimeters and 1.33 meters by 2100 - a wider range than the 28-to-98 centimeters estimate in the last IPCC assessment from 2013.
The IPCC projections, which were reviewed by Reuters, have not been previously reported.
Until now, most glacier research has focused on how warming air melts ice sheets, but warming oceans play a crucial role, said OMG’s principal investigator, Josh Willis.
“It’s not just an ice cube and a hair dryer,” he said, offering an oft-used metaphor for how warmer air melts glaciers. “We’re really just beginning to grapple with how these ice sheets are going to behave in a warming world.”
The OMG project aims to clarify how Greenland itself contributes to rising seas, but also to apply that knowledge to the study of the much larger region of Antarctica, which has far more ice and could ultimately play a much bigger role in sea-level rise. And while most of Greenland's ice is on land above sea level, large parts of the Western Antarctic ice sheet are below sea level, making them more vulnerable to warming oceans.
Melting ice in Greenland currently adds 0.8 millimeters of water to global ocean levels annually, more than any other region, according to NASA. That’s enough water to fill 115 million Olympic-sized swimming pools. 
Scientists authoring the IPCC study, expected to be the most authoritative sea-level assessment to date, declined to discuss the preliminary findings on the record. Hans-Otto Poertner, a leader of the IPCC report, said the document will be “subject to review and further revision” before its planned release in September 2019.
The forecast range for sea-level rise, however, is unlikely to get more precise, one scientist working on the draft said on condition of anonymity.
“The range for sea level rise is getting wider,” the scientist said.
HOLES IN THE DATA
Better projections would be invaluable to governments worldwide. Britain’s Environment Agency, for instance, foresees upgrades to a barrier on the Thames River to protect London against 90 centimeters of sea level rise by 2100, but could modify the plans to account for a catastrophic 2.7 meters.
One 2017 study published by U.S. scientists in a journal of the American Geophysical Union estimated a rise of 50 centimeters by 2100 would submerge land that is now home to about 90 million people, mainly in China, Vietnam and Bangladesh. A rate of 1.5 meters would swamp the homes of more than 150 million people worldwide, the study estimated. 
A 2016 study published in a journal of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences predicted that an event comparable to Superstorm Sandy, which flooded large swaths of the New York region in 2012, would be up to 17 times more likely by 2100 if seas rise by 1 meter.
Higher seas are already creating more dangerous storm surges, the IPCC says, exacerbating flooding or coastal erosion from the U.S. Gulf Coast to the Maldives to China. Some low-lying island nations, such as Fiji and Vanuatu, have moved some coastal communities to higher ground.
The IPCC draft says that the rate of sea level rise in 2100 will depend heavily on the effectiveness of governments in reducing fossil fuel pollution, which the U.N. panel says has been the dominant cause of global warming since the mid-20th century.
But holes in scientists' understanding of ice sheet dynamics also make it difficult to predict how glacier melt will contribute to rising seas, said David Holland, a New York University oceanographer who has studied Greenland’s glaciers for 12 years.
“The modeling of it is like Swiss cheese,” Holland said. “It’s getting into the more challenging projections and unknown physics.”
DEEPER, WARMER WATERS
Some of Greenland’s glaciers are disappearing more rapidly than others, and understanding why is a key goal of NASA’s mission.
New NASA data on water temperature, depth and salinity has helped explain why the rate of ice loss at northwestern Greenland’s Tracy glacier is almost four times the rate of the nearby Heilprin glacier. That’s because the fresh water flowing from Tracy, which sits on deeper bedrock, is mixing with a layer of warm, salty water off Greenland’s coast, accelerating the melting process, the researchers found.
Many more Greenland glaciers are in similar trouble. Researchers discovered last year that 67 glaciers were connected to the warmer, deeper layer at least 200 meters below sea level – at least twice as many as previously known.
In June, an iceberg four miles wide broke away from Greenland’s Helheim Glacier and cracked into pieces in a process called calving, an event that can be caused by warming oceans. Scientists worry that calving will happen on a disastrous scale in Antarctica, where the much larger Thwaites glacier, for instance, is believed to be a linchpin holding back the West Antarctic ice sheet.
“If the Thwaites was to behave in the way of Helheim, we have no idea"" how fast it could erode, said Robert DeConto, who is a professor of geosciences at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and a member of the IPCC team producing the sea-level rise report expected next year.
The IPCC draft suggests that Antarctica alone could contribute up to half a meter of sea level rise this century and cites increasing evidence that the process may be irreversible. 
SOUNDING THE ALARM
The importance of glacier change for global sea-level rise this century was not widely grasped in the scientific community until recently. In 1995, the IPCC’s second assessment said “little change in the extent of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is expected over the next 50–100 years.”
By 2007, it said new data showed “losses from the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica have very likely contributed to sea level rise over 1993 to 2003” but did not factor in future ice-sheet melt because of a lack of published research.
“In the beginning people thought, ‘let’s just assume that those things are stable’,” said climate scientist Gavin Schmidt, who directs the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Even today, he said, “there are very few climate models that have a credible simulation of any kind of dynamic ice sheet behavior at all.”
The scientific uncertainty is a political problem, said Tad Pfeffer, a professor at the University of Colorado and former IPCC author. Skeptics including U.S. President Donald Trump attack the science of climate change as an unproven and politically motivated attack on fossil fuel industries, and Trump last year said he would pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement that includes almost 200 nations.

""The public, especially if they are getting nudged by anti-science views, take uncertainty as saying, ‘These scientists don't know what they’re doing',"" Pfeffer said.

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron's closest security officer, fired after video showed him beating May Day protesters, defended himself before a Senate inquiry on Wednesday, saying he was neither a police officer nor a genuine bodyguard.
Alexandre Benalla, whose case erupted into a political scandal and accusations of unchecked abuses of power in the presidential palace, was questioned for more than two hours about the nature of his job as Macron's security shadow.
Speaking under oath, the neatly dressed former logistics aide at the Elysee was not questioned about the May Day beatings in Paris, but rather his very rapid ascent within Macron's inner circle and how he had gained the right to carry a firearm.
""I was not Macron's bodyguard and never was ... I had a job of ensuring general organization, of security in general,"" the 27-year-old, who has been accused of abusing his office and securing powers unchecked by higher Elysee staff.
Complaining of what he described as a media frenzy around him, Benalla calmly answered questions about how he came to carry a Gluck 43 pistol and to what extent his logistics job overlapped with the self-attributed role of bodyguard.
The Senate inquiry is being conducted in parallel with a judicial investigation into the May 1 incident, which involved Benalla manhandling protesters during a police-led crowd-control operation. While Benalla had asked to be present at the event as an observer, he ended up directly engaged in security and was seen on video wearing some police-marked clothing. 
What turned the incident into a broader political scandal -- the most serious of Macron's 15 months in office -- was the fact Benalla was fired only after the smartphone video became public on July 19, more than six weeks after the events.
That fueled a public perception that the office and people around Macron, whose approval rating has plunged to about 30 percent from highs of 60 percent, were either inept or slack or both when it came to matters of policing and security.
Macron's ministers have rounded on the opposition-controlled Senate, warning member that they risk undermining the presidency and overreaching with their decision to summon Benalla, despite a separate judicial investigation.
In response, opponents have denounced what they regard as an unprecedented attack by the presidency on the parliament.
Benalla himself initially refused to testify, calling the senators ""illegitimate"" and the investigation's chairman a ""little marquis"". He flatly apologized on Wednesday, saying he had felt under pressure by the ""media frenzy"".
Responding to senators' questions without hesitation, Benalla said he requested a firearms permit for his personal safety rather than any bodyguard role. But he admitted he had attended public meetings with Macron with the gun on his belt.

TOKYO (Reuters) - As a Japanese military recruiter sat patiently at a booth outside a supermarket in northern Tokyo one recent weekend, she welcomed a rare visitor, high school student Kazuaki Matsumura.
But Matsumura, who plans to go to university, wasn't there to sign up. He was just curious.
""There are scenes in the media that spark interest in the Self-Defence Forces,"" the 16-year-old said, referring to Japan's military. ""But there are also scenes showing how tough it is and I don't think many want to join. They want to do other things.""
Empty recruiting tables and disinterested audiences are becoming more common for the SDF as Japan's demographic troubles and robust economy have created what some defense insiders call a ""silent crisis"" for military recruiting.
Amid a rock-bottom birth rate, the number of Japanese age 18 to 26 - the core of the recruitment pool - has shrunk to 11 million from 17 million in 1994. That group is forecast to shrink to 7.8 million over the next 30 years.
That has left the SDF unable to hit recruitment quotas since 2014. Overall, the military was only able to recruit about 77 percent of the 9,734 lowest-rank enlisted personnel it had sought in the year ending in March.
""Twenty years from now, unless we can replace a considerable number of people with robots, it'll be hard to maintain the current level of war capability,"" said Akihisa Nagashima, a former parliamentary vice defense minister and conservative independent lawmaker. ""Japan's (security) situation won't be more peaceful, so I think this is really serious.""
The personnel crunch could force Japan's military into tough choices about future missions as it tries to contain China's maritime expansion and deal with volatility on the Korean peninsula. 
""The manpower shortage will affect operational efficiency,"" said Hideshi Tokuchi, a former vice defense minister who once headed the ministry's personnel bureau. ""It is a headache. There is more to do with fewer people and I don't think there is any easy solution.""
A TOUGH SELL
As Japan's economy has improved, unemployment has fallen to around a 25-year low. More high school grads are also heading to college.
That is good news for the country, but it makes military recruiting even tougher. 
""Even though we have the budget, we fall below the allotted number of troops,"" said Kenji Wakamiya, a former defense vice minister who heads a ruling party panel on defense policy.
Japan budgeted for 247,154 SDF personnel in the year to March 2018, but the military employed only 226,789. The biggest shortfall is in the lowest ranks of enlisted personnel, which were roughly 26 percent below their budgeted level.
With conscription deemed unconstitutional, the military is trying to recruit more women, and starting next month, the maximum age for new recruits will be raised to 32. Retirement ages may be increased as well.
""There was a time when it was thought youth equals strength, but if you think about it ... experience and skill have become even more important for today's SDF,"" said Ritsuko Hiroshi, director of the defense ministry's personnel affairs division.
A Female Personnel Empowerment Initiative unveiled last year aims to double the percentage of women in the SDF from 6.1 percent in 2016, and to at least 9 percent by 2030.
That compares with about 15 percent in the United States and 10 percent in Britain.
Although Japanese women can hold a wider range of military jobs than they once could, they still are often assigned to non-combat roles, officials and experts said.
""They tend to be positions that are traditionally coded female ... anything that doesn't require picking up a weapon,"" said Sabine Fruhstuck, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
A SOFTER IMAGE
Recent pop culture campaigns such as manga-style posters help create a ""soft"" image of the SDF among the public, but the impact on recruitment is limited, experts said.
""Hardly anyone joins because he or she saw a poster. They are encouraged to join by parents or relatives or teachers who were former SDF members,"" said Hitotsubashi University professor Fumika Sato, who researches recruitment.
It takes roughly 5,000 SDF officials, many in regional headquarters, to recruit about 14,000 new personnel each year.
""It's a very time-consuming, labor-intensive business,"" Tokuchi said. ""Recruiters have to approach high schools and parents to explain what they have to do and can do in the military ... and then take kids to events organized by the defense forces and induce them to take the exam,"" he said.
The defense ministry is seeking a 5.8 percent increase in the military recruitment budget for the year from April to 2.4 billion yen ($21 million). 
The SDF last year embraced internet advertising, which resulted in a three-fold increase in visits to its recruiting homepage, said Major Yoshiaki Hayashida of the Ground Self-Defence Force staff office's personnel division.
About 90 percent of the public has a positive view of the SDF, surveys show, largely due to military disaster relief work, but that doesn't necessarily mean they want to serve, recruiters and experts said.
""People want to join because it's challenging, a stable job and because they want to be useful,"" said Colonel Shuzo Yoshida, head of recruiting at the SDF's Tokyo Provincial Cooperation Headquarters. 
Hiroki Hashimoto, 24, who attended an army technical high school and the National Defence Academy, was more explicit.
""Many people join the SDF or attend its technical high school because they are poor. That is a fact,"" said Hashimoto, who did not enlist.
A post-war attachment to pacifist ideals also complicates recruitment.
""Compared to 10-20 years ago, the SDF is more firmly established in society,"" Nagashima said. ""But because Japan had the trauma of defeat in the war, and many were sacrificed, I think it will take 100 years (for sentiments to change).""

940,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 06:22AM ET</span>",Some gun-toting Texans embrace Democrat's call for tougher firearm laws,"By Tim Reid and James Oliphant
CARRIZO SPRINGS/KATY, Texas (Reuters) - Texas cattle rancher Bill Martin is a lifelong Republican who owns more than 20 firearms and has been shooting guns since the age of 6.
He is now considering the once-unthinkable: voting for a Democratic Senate candidate who wants tougher gun laws.
Martin, 72, has a simple explanation for his change of heart: He is sick of the gun violence plaguing America and his gun-loving state, where 26 worshippers died in a church massacre last year.
""Even as conservative as I am, there has to be a middle ground on guns,"" said Martin during an interview on his ranch near the city of Carrizo Springs.
Martin’s nuanced view on firearms - he loves them but wants to see tougher restrictions - is one U.S. Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke hopes is gaining traction in Texas. 
O'Rourke, a congressman from El Paso and the Democratic challenger to Ted Cruz in November's Texas Senate race, has made reforming gun laws a central part of his platform, calling for universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons.
In previous elections, a Democrat calling for gun reforms in Texas, which has the country's highest rate of gun ownership, faced almost certain political suicide. But O'Rourke is presenting a serious challenge to Cruz. 
A Reuters/Ipsos/UVA Center for Politics poll released on Wednesday shows O'Rourke having pulled even with Cruz among likely voters. Other recent polling has shown Cruz slightly ahead, and a Quinnipiac University Poll released Tuesday found O'Rourke trailing by 9 percentage points. 
For both parties, stakes in the Texas race are high. Democrats need to pick up two seats in the Nov. 6 elections to claim a majority in the Senate, and Republicans want to keep the state, which hasn't elected a Democrat to statewide office since 1994, in its ""safe"" column for national elections. 
(For a graphic on Texas electoral politics: https://tmsnrt.rs/2pg6PRh) 
O'Rourke's competitiveness challenges the long-held assumption that gun regulation is a dangerous issue to embrace in red states like Texas. This year, seven congressional Democratic candidates in the state have also embraced gun reforms, and all of them have been endorsed by the firearms safety group founded by former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords. The organization did not endorse any Texas candidates in 2016.
Gun control is ""not a black and white issue,"" said Geoffrey Skelley, an independent analyst on Senate races at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, ""and I guess for O'Rourke that's good news, because if it was he'd probably be in a lot of trouble in a state like Texas."" 
Cruz, who is seeking a second term in the U.S. Senate, is putting his faith in the traditional playbook, attacking his opponent for his positions on firearms. 
At a recent campaign event near Houston, Cruz called O'Rourke's views on guns ""completely out of step with the values of most Texans,” saying O'Rourke advocated ""banning some of the most popular firearms in America."" 
O'Rourke's campaign did not respond to interview requests from Reuters. 
CHANGING ATTITUDES
Support for gun regulation in the United States has ebbed and flowed, but in recent years, polls have found growing support nationally for tougher gun laws. In a poll last October of American adults, Gallup found that 67 percent of respondents favored stricter laws governing gun sales, the highest percentage since 1993.
A Reuters/Ipsos national poll this year found similar support for gun control in Texas, with two-thirds of adults supporting “strong” or “moderate” regulations or restrictions on firearms. 
Texas voters remain sharply divided by party on the issue, however, a Quinnipiac University Poll found in May. While 70 percent of Texas Republicans opposed stricter gun laws, the poll found, 79 percent of Democrats supported them.
To win in November, O'Rourke would need massive Democratic turnout, said the University of Virginia's Skelley, and the gun issue might help him motivate the party's base.
Ford O'Connell, a Republican strategist and Texas native, is skeptical whether most gun owners will accept O'Rourke's message. 
""I don't see the issue helping O'Rourke,"" O'Connell said. ""It may help with his base, but this helps Cruz more.""
His position on guns has definitely helped Cruz with fundraising. This election cycle, he has been the top recipient of donations from gun rights groups, receiving nearly $42,000 from them, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. 
'SLIPPERY SLOPE' VS. 'COMMON SENSE'
Cruz hammers hard on gun rights during campaign stops. 
At the Tin Roof BBQ outside Houston, the Republican derided O'Rourke for touting his poor rating from the National Rifle Association. Later that day, Cruz spoke at his former high school in Katy, near Santa Fe High School, where 10 people were killed by a gunman earlier this year.
He said teachers with firearms training should be allowed to have a gun in classrooms.
“The number one thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” he said to cheers and applause.
The Republican's pro-gun message resonates with Valerie Hernandez, co-owner of Double H Outfitters, a deer and dove hunting business near San Antonio, and one of some two dozen Texas gun enthusiasts interviewed by Reuters. 
""It's a slippery slope,"" she said of O'Rourke's position on guns. ""He'll start to take some gun rights away and end up taking our weapons.""
That kind of criticism of O'Rourke is ""absolutely over the top,"" said Brian King, an avid hunter who owns rifles, shotguns and handguns.
King, 29, said he voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential contest but is leaning toward backing O'Rourke this year. He said that, while he doesn't favor an assault weapons ban, he is more worried about safety in schools and other public spaces than about people having their guns taken away.

""I am totally on board for some common-sense gun reform,"" King said.

941,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 06:15AM ET</span>",Tightening Texas race boosts Democrats' hopes of taking Senate: Reuters poll,"By Chris Kahn
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Democratic congressman aiming to unseat Republican U.S. Senator Ted Cruz in Texas has pulled even in the race, a Reuters poll found, a spark of hope for a party seeking a Senate majority to curb President Donald Trump's agenda.
The Reuters/Ipsos/UVA Center for Politics Poll released on Wednesday of several competitive U.S. Senate races offered a mixed picture of Democrats' chances in November of winning the two seats they would need to take control of that chamber.
It showed tight races in Arizona, where Democrats are hoping to win a seat held by a retiring Republican, and in Florida, where Republicans aim to unseat a Democratic incumbent.
Democrats are broadly seen as facing steep odds in trying to capture a Senate majority in the Nov. 6 congressional elections as they have to defend seats in 10 states that the Republican Trump won in the 2016 presidential election. Texas, Florida, Arizona and Nevada, all surveyed in the poll, are four of the most competitive Senate races.
(To see poll results: https://tmsnrt.rs/2piev5l)
Among the bright spots for Democrats: U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas had a 2-percentage-point lead over Cruz among likely voters in the state and U.S. Representative Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona had a 3-point lead over Republican congresswoman Martha McSally in the race to succeed U.S. Senator Jeff Flake, one of Trump's most vocal critics from within his own party.
Both leads are within the poll's 4-percentage-point credibility intervals, a measure of precision, meaning the candidates are drawing about the same level of support.
The finding suggests that O'Rourke has a shot at becoming the first Democrat to represent Texas in the U.S. Senate in a quarter century.
""There's a possibility it could happen. I'm not saying probable. But it's possible,"" said Larry Sabato, director of the UVA Center for Politics. 
Cruz's feuds with Trump during his unsuccessful 2016 campaign also hurt his standing with some Texas Republicans, Sabato added, saying: ""That damaged him with parts of the Texas electorate that he needs for re-election.""
The Reuters/Ipsos/UVA poll was conducted online, in English, from Sept. 5 to 17. It surveyed between 992 and 1,039 people in each of five states including California and weighted the responses according to the latest government population estimates.
The results measured how voters felt at the time of the survey. In 2016, one in eight Americans decided which candidate to vote for in the presidential election in the week before Election Day, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.
Other surveys have found that Cruz maintained a strong lead. A Quinnipiac University Poll released on Tuesday showed Cruz holding a 9-point lead over O'Rourke.
O'Rourke on Tuesday launched his campaign's first Spanish-language TV ads, a move acknowledging the Democrat would need strong turnout by Hispanic voters to win. The poll showed Hispanic voters preferring O'Rourke by about a 2-to-1 margin over Cruz, who is of Cuban heritage.
GILLUM HAS EDGE IN FLORIDA
The poll also showed Florida's Republican governor, Rick Scott, with a 1-percentage-point lead over Democratic U.S. Senator Bill Nelson. Nelson's seat is one of the 10 Democrats are fighting to keep in states that Trump won in 2016.
The poll showed Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum with a 6-point lead, exceeding the 4-point credibility interval, over former U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis in the race to succeed Scott as governor.
If Gillum wins, he would be Florida's first black governor, and enthusiasm around his campaign could help Nelson as the two share the Democratic ticket across the state. DeSantis has closely aligned himself with Trump and the contest immediately became racially charged following a comment the Republican denied was racially motivated.
The poll showed Nevada U.S. Senator Dean Heller holding a 3-percentage-point lead over Democratic U.S. Representative Jacky Rosen. Heller is the only Republican senator defending a seat in a state that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won in 2016.

In California's Democrat-versus-Democrat race, U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein held a 20-point lead state Senator Kevin de Leon, according to the poll.

942,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 06:07AM ET</span>",Korea summit economic pledge raises sanctions-busting fears,"By Jeongmin Kim and Joyce Lee
SEOUL (Reuters) - A pledge by the leaders of North and South Korea to foster economic ties has heightened worries among skeptics that Seoul's push to revive nuclear talks could undermine the sanction regime credited with bringing Pyongyang to the negotiating table.
Speaking at a joint news conference in Pyongyang on Wednesday, South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said he and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to the normalization of the Kaesong joint border industrial park and tours to North Korea's Mount Kumgang. 
The two projects, which were suspended amid tensions between the rivals under Moon's two conservative predecessors, had been lucrative sources of cash for the impoverished North.
Moon said the steps were part of an agreement to turn the Korean peninsula into a ""land of peace without nuclear weapons and nuclear threats"".
But his visit was criticized by U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham who said it risked undermining the U.S. policy of ""maximum pressure"" aimed at leaving Pyongyang little choice but to abandon its nuclear and missile development programs.
""While North Korea has stopped testing missiles and nuclear devices, they have NOT moved toward denuclearization,"" Graham said on Twitter. ""South Korea should not be played by Kim Jong Un.""
North Korea is believed to have earned hundreds of millions of dollars by skirting layers of U.N. Security Council sanctions dating back to 2006, the year of its first nuclear test, trading in banned minerals and weapons.
Some South Korean firms had been accused of importing coal from the North disguised as Russian shipments in violation of U.N. sanctions, which critics say raises questions about Seoul's will to vigorously enforce international sanctions.
""We are currently cooperating within the framework of international sanctions,"" Yoon Young-chan, South Korea's presidential senior secretary for public communications said this week. ""We believe if new conditions are formed, changes could be possible,"" he added. 
CASH COWS
The Kaesong industrial park is subject to Security Council sanctions adopted in September 2017 that banned clothing and textile exports, as well as a ban on financial joint ventures with North Korea.
At the height of its operations, it brought Pyongyang an estimated $110 million in wages and fees, according to a 2016 South Korean government statement.
The resumption of South Korean tours to the Mount Kumgang resort, meanwhile, suspended in 2008 after a South Korean woman was fatally shot by North Korean guards, could violate the U.N. sanctions banning the transfer of bulk cash to Pyongyang.
At its heyday, the tours to the East Coast border resort, operated by a unit of the Hyundai conglomerate, were a $40 million-a-year moneyspinner for the impoverished North.
Kim Sung-han, South Korean vice foreign minister under one of Moon's conservative predecessors and now a professor of international studies at Korea University, accused Moon of being ready to breach sanctions in pursuit of the goal of denuclearizing the North.
""Under the grand premise, minor disputes and unintended collateral damages like sanctions violations are seen as okay if the progress in inter-Korean relations can lead to progress in denuclearization,"" Kim said.
Bruce Bennett, of the RAND Corporation in California, said Moon's strategy could put Seoul at odds with the United States. 
""President Moon apparently hopes that President Trump will simply agree with doing what North Korea wants. I think President Moon is taking a serious risk,"" Bennett said. 
Tycoons from some of South Korea's largest family-run conglomerates accompanied Moon to Pyongyang this week at the request of the South's presidential office, with North Korean officials warmly greeting business leaders including Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) vice chairman Jay Y. Lee. 
On Wednesday, Moon was scheduled to visit Mansudae Art Studio - an entity that was blacklisted by the Security Council last year for earning cash to fund its arms program by erecting monuments and military facilities in African countries. 

Yoon, South Korea's presidential senior secretary for public communications, said Moon's visit on Wednesday afternoon had been previously scheduled and ""simply consists of viewing artworks"".

The issue could further worsen relations between Beijing and Washington, which are already engaged in an increasingly bitter trade war, and may spur China to retaliate.
The Wall Street Journal said the U.S. Justice Department had demanded that China's official Xinhua news agency and state television's English station CGTN register as foreign agents, which could limit their access in Washington.
""Both sides have had contact and communication on this issue,"" ministry spokesman Geng Shuang replied at a daily news briefing, when asked about the report.
""We hope that the relevant side provides convenience and creates conditions for the media in carrying out their normal work, and not put up barriers.""
All countries should view the media with an open and inclusive attitude and not ""politicize"" the matter, he added.
Asked if China could take corresponding measures against U.S. media groups, Geng said it had always supported foreign reporters and expected them to respect the law and report in a fair and objective manner.

The two sides are in advanced talks to resolve a dispute over such appointments, one of the biggest obstacles to the resumption of diplomatic ties cut almost 70 years ago.
An estimated 12 million Catholics in China are split between an underground Church that swears loyalty to the Vatican and the state-supervised Catholic Patriotic Association.
The Global Times newspaper, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said there were no ""disputes on issues of principle"" between the two and an agreement could be reached on the bishops.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he had no information to provide on any visit by a Vatican delegation.
""China and the Vatican have all along been maintaining effective contacts,"" he told a daily news briefing, without elaborating.
China keeps a tight grip on religious groups, despite the government professing to guarantee freedom of belief.
Last month, Beijing's most senior official for religion wrote that religious matters in China cannot be controlled by foreigners.
Another issue to be resolved is self-ruled Taiwan, with which the Vatican maintains formal diplomatic ties, although China claims it as a wayward province.

While restoring diplomatic ties was not part of the talks, full relations would give the church a legal framework to look after all China's Catholics and focus on the community's growth in a country where Protestant churches are already growing fast.

948,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 19, 2018 04:26AM ET</span>",North Korea's Kim agree to inspections in bid to salvage nuclear talks,"By Hyonhee Shin and Soyoung Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said on Wednesday it would permanently abolish its key missile facilities in the presence of foreign experts, the latest gesture by leader Kim Jong Un to revive faltering talks with Washington over his country's nuclear program.
Speaking at a joint news conference in Pyongyang, Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in said they agreed to turn the Korean peninsula into a ""land of peace without nuclear weapons and nuclear threats"". 
They said the North was also willing to close its main nuclear complex if the United States took unspecified ""reciprocal action.""
The pledges Kim and Moon made at their third summit this year could inject fresh momentum into the stalled nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang and lay the groundwork for another meeting Kim recently proposed to U.S. President Donald Trump.
""I don't think President Moon got everything he was seeking from these interactions, but Kim Jong Un gave Moon some tangible things for which he can take credit,"" said Michael Madden, an analyst at the Stimson Centre's 38 North think tank in Washington. 
""These are good-faith gestures which will likely facilitate further and more substantive negotiations,"" Madden said, adding a second summit between Kim and Trump was ""highly probable"".
Kim pledged to work toward the ""complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula"" during his two meetings with Moon earlier this year and at his historic June summit with Trump in Singapore.
But discussions over how to implement the vague commitments have since faltered. Washington is demanding concrete action towards denuclearization, such as a full disclosure of North Korea's nuclear and missile facilities, before agreeing to key goals of Pyongyang - declaring an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War and easing tough international sanctions. 
Trump‏ called the latest pledges ""very exciting"".
""Kim Jong Un has agreed to allow nuclear inspections, subject to final negotiations, and to permanently dismantle a test site and launch pad in the presence of international experts. In the meantime there will be no rocket or nuclear testing,"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
Kim said he would visit Seoul in the near future, in what would be the first-ever visit to the South's capital by a North Korean leader. Moon said the visit was expected to take place by the end of the year.
The leaders of the two Koreas also announced a series of steps to deepen bilateral exchanges in the economy, culture and sport.
VERIFICATION
Kim's latest promises come days before Moon meets Trump in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly next week. Seoul officials hope Moon will be able to convince Trump to restart nuclear talks with Pyongyang, after he canceled a trip by his secretary of state to Pyongyang last month, citing lack of progress. 
Though North Korea has unilaterally stopped nuclear and missile tests, it did not allow international inspections of the dismantling its only known nuclear test site in May, drawing criticism that its action was for show and could be easily reversed.
As a next step, North Korea will allow experts from ""concerned countries"" to watch the closure of its missile engine testing site and launch pad in the northwestern town of Dongchang-ri, according to a joint statement signed by Moon and Kim. The facilities were a key test center for its intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to reach the United States.
The North also ""expressed its readiness"" to take additional measures, such as a permanent dismantlement of its main nuclear facilities in Yongbyon should there be unspecified corresponding action from the United States.
Those U.S. steps could include an end-of-war declaration, South Korea's national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, told reporters.
The neighbors remain still technically at war because the Korean War ended in armistice and not a peace treaty.
North Korea has consistently refused to give up its nuclear arsenal unilaterally, and stressed that the United States should first agree to a formal declaration ending the war.
Satellite images and other evidence in recent months have suggested North Korea is continuing to work on its nuclear program clandestinely. 
Seo Yu-suk, a research manager at the Institute of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said the facilities at Dongchang-ri and Yongbyon are ""almost obsolete"" and the North has mobile missile launchers that are easier to use and harder to detect, while there are likely covert sites elsewhere. 
SANCTIONS BUSTING?
The two Koreas agreed to begin construction to reconnect railways and roads linking the countries within this year. They will also work to restart a joint factory park in the North border city of Kaesong and tours to the North's Mount Kumgang resort, when conditions are met. 
But some experts worry those projects could constitute a violation of U.N. Security Council sanctions aimed at drying up resources for Pyongyang's weapons programs, and upset Washington. 
The two Koreas also agreed to pursue a bid to co-host the 2032 Summer Olympic Games, and actively work together in other international competitions including the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
Later on Wednesday, Moon is scheduled to watch the North's signature ""Brilliant Fatherland"" Mass Game, with a formation of glowing drones, lasers and stadium-sized gymnastics shows designed to glorify the country.
On Thursday, the last day of his three-day visit, Moon plans to visit Mount Baektu in North Korea with Kim before returning home. 

North Korea says Kim's grandfather and father were born at Mount Baektu, a centerpiece of the North’s idolization and propaganda campaign to highlight the ruling family's sacred bloodline.

MALE/COLOMBO (Reuters) - More than a quarter of a million people will vote on Sunday for the next leader of the tropical Maldives in an election criticized internationally for a lack of transparency and suppression of government critics. 
President Abdulla Yameen is seeking a second five-year term in the Indian Ocean archipelago, a popular high-end tourist destination and a key state in the battle for influence between India and China. 
But the government has jailed many of his main rivals after speedy trials for charges ranging from terrorism to corruption, and introduced new vote-counting rules that observers say will prevent them from seeing individual ballot papers, leading to doubts about the legitimacy of the vote. 
The main opposition Maldives Democratic Party (MDP) and local and international observers have also raised concerns over restrictions on foreign journalists wanting to cover the polls and the Election Commission's refusal to share the final list of voters.
""Maldives authorities have detained critics, muzzled the media and misused the Election Commission to obstruct opposition candidates to ensure President Yameen a victory on election day,” said Patricia Gossman, Asia associate director at Human Rights Watch.
Transparency Maldives (TM), an independent election monitor, said on Tuesday that ""unless these issues are resolved, it is very likely that the outcome of such an election will not be accepted by the people"".
Election Commission spokesman Ahmed Akram told Reuters the allegations ""don't have any basis in reality"". 
""The counting process will not be different from the previous elections,"" he said. 
The Election Commission has previously said that foreign observers will be present, without naming who those will be. 
Yameen, 59, dismissed allegations of abuse of power earlier this month during campaigning. 
""If the accusations about authoritarianism are true, when I go to islands, the people will tell me 'we are tolerating so much abuse',"" he said. 
""I won't see smiles on the faces. No one will come to greet me and shake my hand, if there is tyranny.""
POLITICAL MANEUVERS
The country has faced upheaval since February, when Yameen imposed a state of emergency to annul a Supreme Court ruling that quashed the convictions of nine opposition leaders, including former president Mohamed Nasheed, the country's first democratically elected leader. 
Since then, Yameen's ruling coalition has enacted laws without a required quorum in parliament, approved by the Supreme Court after its chief justice was arrested in February for alleged corruption under emergency regulations.
MDP leader Nasheed, who in 2009 famously held a cabinet meeting underwater in scuba gear to highlight the dangers of global warming to the low-lying islands, is currently in exile in Sri Lanka and is barred from standing in Sunday's poll.
Member of parliament Ibrahim Mohamed Solih (Ibu) is running against Yameen under an opposition coalition, promising democracy, a crackdown on corruption and better relations with the West after Yameen steered the country closer to China.
""What happens from today to the voting day remains uncertain,"" the MDP's spokesman, Hamid Abdul Ghafoor, who lives in exile, told Reuters.
Yameen's administration made defamation a crime in 2016, a move government critics say was aimed at stifling dissent. It also suspended 56 lawyers from attending court last year for demanding to uphold the rule of law.
""The space for civil society has not shrunk. It does not exist any more,"" Shahindha Ismail, the executive director at Maldives Democracy Network, told Reuters. 
Yameen has disregarded calls from the United Nations, several western countries and India for an amicable solution to the lingering political crisis. In 2016, the Maldives quit the Commonwealth group of nations, which threatened to suspend the country after it criticized the government for rights abuses.

The airport is a centerpiece of a 15-year construction boom under President Tayyip Erdogan. It has an initial planned capacity of 90 million passengers a year, making it one of the world's biggest airports.
Istanbul's governor said on Sunday more than 400 people were initially detained for taking part in the protests. Work resumed at the airport on Monday with a heavy police and gendarmerie presence, according to labor unions.
A total of 43 people among those detained were sent to an Istanbul court to rule on what action would be taken and it released 19 of them subject to judicial monitoring, CNN Turk said.
The 24 formally arrested and remanded in custody faced provisional charges such resisting police, damaging public property and contravening the law governing protests, it said. 
Workers have long complained about food, housing and work safety conditions at the construction site, which unions have likened to a concentration camp. 
In February, Turkey's labor ministry said 27 workers had died at the airport since the start of work in 2015, mainly from accidents or health problems. Protests started on Friday after a shuttle bus accident injured 17 workers.

The Supreme Court outlawed the practice last year, but Modi's government wants to make it a non-bailable offense carrying a jail term of up to three years, following protests by Muslim women.
Federal Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told a news conference the cabinet approved the decree because the practice persisted despite the court decision. 
In August last year, the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional a law that allowed Muslim men to divorce their wives simply by uttering the word ""talaq"", or ""divorce"" in Arabic, three times.

The government has been trying to pass legislation to ""explicitly ban"" the procedure. In an Independence Day speech last month Modi said he would ""not stop till they get justice,"" referring to the women.

TANGIER, Morocco (Reuters) - African emigrants are defying a campaign by Morocco to keep them away from land and sea crossings to Spain, which has become the main entry point to Europe for migrants and refugees following crackdowns elsewhere.
Moroccan police conduct regular raids of areas popular with people from elsewhere in Africa and have bussed thousands to the other end of the country since 800 people stormed a fence to the Spanish enclave of Ceuta in northern Morocco in July.
The transports drew criticism from human rights groups after two men from Mali died en route and Reuters has found that many people have simply returned, hiding in forests or back streets of the main city of Tangier and planning their escape to Spain.
""We came to Morocco to stay in the north until the time was right to force our way through the Ceuta fence. We have no other choice,"" said Aboubakar, a 25-year-old sociology graduate from Guinea who withheld his surname for fear of repercussions.
His account and those of his companions sleeping in a forest overlooking the poor Tangier neighborhood of Mesnana show how hard it is to stop people who are determined to cross to Europe.
The number of people fleeing war or poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia who cross to the European Union has dropped to about 80,000 this year from more than a million in 2015, but the issue is divisive and has bolstered far-right and other anti-establishment groups.
And as Italy closes its ports to most asylum-seekers, more are entering Spain. So far this year 38,852 people have followed that route, U.N. data shows, at least twice as many as the same period of 2017. More than 310 have died at sea.
The vast majority come via Morocco, which foiled a further 54,000 illegal migration attempts by August, Khalid Zerouali, migration and border control director at the Interior ministry, told Reuters.
""We received tip-offs that trafficking networks were emboldened after the July crossing into Ceuta and were preparing large-scale assaults on security forces at the border this summer,"" he said.
The North African kingdom is a destination in itself and has granted 56,000 residency permits to foreigners, mostly from Sub-Saharan Africa, since it reformed its migration policy in 2013.
Some of these people now say they have been forced from their homes, caught up in the campaign to stop illegal migration. Zerouali said Morocco was under enormous pressure.
MASS RETURN
While some migrants try to reach Ceuta and another Spanish enclave, Melilla, others pay smugglers to put them on boats, as Spain is just 14 km across the western end of the Mediterranean.
Countries can return people arriving irregularly if asylum requests are refused. Yet when the fence was stormed again in August, Spain returned more than 100 people en masse, drawing criticism from rights groups; Madrid said it followed protocols.
The incident held echoes of an earlier spike in border stormings in 2005 accompanied by expulsions from Spain. Human rights groups accused Morocco of bussing people into the desert.
The new mass return is a sign of the sensitivity of the migrant issue in Spain, one of a dwindling number of European countries where the public has not turned against immigration.
Opposition politicians said the expulsions clashed with the tone set by new Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez when he welcomed a ship full of migrants turned away by Italy in June.
No far-right party has been in parliament since Spain's right-wing dictatorship ended in 1975 but the nationalist Vox party has criticized Sanchez over migration and his government's minority means a new election may come before it is due in 2020.
Morocco, which other Africans can visit without visas, became the main launchpad for Europe in July after Italy's tougher line and EU aid to the Libyan coastguard stemmed flows from Libya, where people-smugglers had thrived.
""The presence of some nationalities that in the past had mainly passed through Libya indicate that some migratory flows may have shifted to the Western Mediterranean route,"" the European border agency Frontex said on Friday.
FOREST
Reuters found a dozen migrants hiding in the forest near Tangier some 70 km from Ceuta -- sleeping rough on blankets.
Some had entered Morocco legally and either worked as day laborers or farm hands or begged on the streets to save enough to pay smugglers for the boat trip.
""We were arrested in our houses early in the morning in late August, taken for identification at a police station and then handcuffed and forced into a bus,"" said Aliou, a Guinean national, asking like others not to use his full name.
He had to leave all his belongings in his rented apartment in Tangier. ""We were given just one sandwich on the 10-hour trip before being abandoned near the city of Tiznit,"" he said.
Six days later he and other migrants managed to return to the forest near Tangier but they expect authorities to come back any time in what migrants call a ""black man hunt"", because it excludes Moroccans and Syrians who also try to cross to Spain.
At a much larger makeshift camp opposite the bus station of commercial hub Casablanca, some 300 km south of Tangier, people said they were on their way back north after being bussed south.
Mamadou, a young man from Cameroon who came via Algeria, said he had tried to scale the Ceuta fence in July, but had hurt his leg. He was bussed to the southern city of Agadir, but scraped together enough money for a bus ticket to Casablanca.
""Now, I will stay here until I get a ticket to go back to the north to pursue my dream of reaching Europe,"" he said inside a tent made of remnants of wooden boxes and blankets.
Authorities described the bussing of people from the border as a crackdown on trafficking gangs, and called on the European Union for more help. The European Commission promised more money to help Spain and Morocco cope last month, but declined to give a figure, saying funds were limited.
Morocco, like other North African countries, rejects an idea suggested by some European officials that it should host centers to decide on asylum requests outside the EU.
""When we find a paperless Sub-Saharan who is preparing to cross the border illegally we just remove him from the north to other cities,"" Zerouali said. ""It is better for them to be sent to a city such as Marrakech than stay in the forests surrounding Tangier.""
Seventy-four trafficking networks had been dismantled since January, he said, adding that the kingdom spends at least 200 million euros annually to keep its borders safe. He dismissed reports of human rights violations, saying that sending migrants to the south ""takes place in full compliance with the law"".
DAWN RAID
Human rights groups say the campaign is an indiscriminate and forcible displacement violating freedom of movement.
Citing figures from local groups, Amnesty International said some 5,000 Sub-Saharans had been put on buses without checking their legal status, and abandoned in remote areas.
A coalition of Sub-Saharan community associations in Morocco (ASCOMS) said ""excessive use of force"" during expulsions caused the deaths of two Malians last month. Officials reject this account.
In the Tangier district of Branes where many sub-Saharans live, Aissatou Barry, who has been in Morocco for eight years after fleeing Ivory Coast, said police raided her house at 5 a.m. on Aug. 9.
Even though she has a residency card, she said she and her children were taken with others to a police station and only let go later in the day. When she returned to the house she rents for 410 euros per month, her valuables had been stolen.
She said she filed a complaint about the raid to the regional human rights council; the council said it had received complaints from Barry in the past, but declined further details.
Barry, who founded the Ponts Solidaires association to help migrants integrate in Morocco and give up the idea of the risky sea crossing, said she felt humiliated.
""I have always considered Morocco my home, now after this raid I no longer feel so,"" she said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia plans to increase the maximum jail term to 15 years for anyone convicted of contaminating foodstuffs, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday, as a scare over needles found in strawberries and other fruits gripped the country.
Police are investigating more than 100 reports of needles found in fruit. Needles, first found in strawberries produced by one supplier in the northern state of Queensland, are now turning up around the country. 
On Tuesday, police in New South Wales said they were investigating incidents involving an apple and a banana.
Nobody has sustained serious injury yet, and a senior Australian minister said many of the cases would turn out to be hoaxes. 
But with demand plunging, strawberry farmers have been forced to dump produce, casting a shadow over an industry worth A$160 million ($115.84 million).
Responding to the scare, Morrison said his government would seek to increase the maximum jail term to 15 years from 10 years for anyone convicted of tampering with food.
The government will also move to criminalize hoax claims before parliament rises for a two-week holiday on Thursday, Morrison said.
""It's not funny, putting the livelihoods of hard-working Australians at risk,"" the prime minister told reporters in Canberra. ""If you do that sort of thing in this country we will come after you and we will throw the book at you.""
Australia's Attorney-General Christian Porter said that the government was looking at introducing a maximum 10-year jail sentence for hoaxers.
While farmers welcomed the government action, many said they face financial ruin if demand does not recover quickly.
""It is costing us a lot of money. On our own farm, (it costs) about $35,000 per day to harvest just the fruit we are dumping,"" said Gavin Scurr, a strawberry grower in Wamuran, 64 KM (39 miles) north of Brisbane.
Australia's banking industry said it is willing to offer financial assistance to affected farmers.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican authorities fired a forensic official on Tuesday after an outcry over the storage of some 150 bodies in a refrigerated container truck that roamed towns in Jalisco state, where morgues are filled with victims of the country's drug war.
Killings in the western state, home to one of Mexico's most violent and powerful drug gangs, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, have already hit a record 16,339 so far this year, and the national homicide rate is rising having already hit its highest in modern history last year.     
Accusations that authorities in Jalisco were mishandling bodies flared last week after the semi-trailer truck with 150 corpses was spotted in a warehouse on the outskirts of Mexico's second largest city Guadalajara, drawing the ire of the mayor of the borough, who said it was illegally parked.
It then turned up next to houses in a field further from the city, where neighbors complained it emitted a powerful stench. 
Jalisco state spokesman Gonzalez Sanchez told local radio that Luis Octavio Cotero, who had headed the forensic institute since 2015, was dismissed because he failed to take responsibility for storing the bodies. 
Cotero told Reuters that his agency was not responsible for storing the unclaimed bodies, and accused the government of making him a scapegoat after he questioned the findings of an investigation into the disappearance of three film students earlier this year. 
""It's bad political conduct. I feel sorry for the institute,"" Cotero said, adding that state officials knew they needed more morgue space as much as two years ago.
""Only now are they looking around ... It's inefficacy that has put our state in such a sorry position,"" he said. 
Cotero said another 100 bodies were being kept in a separate refrigerated truck parked at the forensic institute, and that the other truck had been forced to move for lack of parking space.
The state's spokesman said an investigation has begun to sort out ""numerous versions"" of who gave orders to move the containers.
Mexico's national human rights commission and its Jalisco branch on Tuesday called for a probe into the case, describing the local government's treatment of the cadavers as ""inhumane.""

Work on a new facility to hold 700 bodies is underway, the state's general secretary Roberto Lopez told local media last week.

A worker accidentally mixed pool chlorine and hydrochloric acid, used as a cleaning agent, at the Pullman Hotel, Steve Vaughan, acting superintendent of New South Wales Ambulance, told Reuters.
The chemical reaction can produce hydrogen chloride gas.
Vaughan said the gas flowed through the air conditioning system in the building, which faces Hyde Park in the city center, at around 9 a.m. (2300 Tuesday GMT).
A spokeswoman for  Accor  (PA:ACCP) SA, owner of the Pullman Hotel had no immediate comment.
About 30 people were affected, with symptoms ranging from eye irritation to breathing problems and a tingling sensation in the throat, Vaughan said.
Eight people, including the worker who mixed the chemicals, were deemed ill enough to be taken to hospital and are in a stable condition. 
One guest, Mathais Otterstedt, told reporters outside the hotel that people were coughing in the corridors, but most left quickly and he saw no-one seriously hurt.

""It was an acute smell of chlorine in the air ... it was sort of coming out from the vents and it was very strong, people were coving their faces and I instantly realized that there was something wrong,"" he said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A year after a devastating earthquake struck Mexico City and killed dozens of people, Guadalupe Padilla is still waiting to return to her home.
The 60-year-old security guard has lived in a wooden shack in a park facing the now-empty apartment block where she spent three decades of her life.
Padilla is one of hundreds of people in the capital who have been unable to return to their homes, according to Reuters interviews with over a dozen people left homeless by the quake.
In early September last year, an 8.1 earthquake struck Southern Mexico, killing about 100 people and toppling buildings. Twelve days later on Sept. 19, the anniversary of a 1985 quake that claimed tens of thousands of lives in Mexico City, a 7.1 magnitude tremor shook the center of the country, killing about 370 people.
Fearing her apartment was unsafe after the second earthquake, Padilla fled and waited for the building to be repaired. 
Many of the people interviewed by Reuters said they are still waiting for assistance promised by the government. Others refuse to leave their homes, even if they are badly damaged, for fear they will be permanently displaced.
About three weeks ago, the building's management told Padilla to remove the rest of her belongings, without providing information about what lay ahead, she said.
""It's not fair for them to kick us out without explaining anything,"" Padilla said.
Reuters was unable to locate the managers of the building. 
President Enrique Pena Nieto's office on Tuesday said the government had provided aid to help rebuild 166,000 homes of more than 169,000 that were damaged, mostly in the south. The Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on those left homeless.
But 434 buildings in Mexico City are still at risk of collapse and over 1,000 require significant reinforcement before they can be reoccupied, the capital's government said.
The dilemma can be felt acutely in Tlalpan, a neighborhood in the capital's southern reaches hit hard by the quake. 
In the sprawling housing complex known as Multifamiliar Tlalpan where Padilla once lived, one building collapsed, killing nine people, and the remaining towers were declared uninhabitable. Some 500 families lost their homes, according to Citizen watchdog group Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity (MCCI). 
Padilla said the government has been more concerned with launching new development projects than looking after residents.
""After everything happened here, the construction mafia got started,"" Padilla said, referring to a wave of construction firms that she said came after the quake to redevelop the site. 
In a report published last week, MCCI said it found evidence of poor construction in the Tlalpan complex and other buildings that fell in the city. 
In some cases, residents had complained of severe structural damage before the quakes, the group said.
Rather than heeding residents' complaints, city authorities slashed budgets for the buildings and continued to liberally grant construction permits, MCCI found.
City officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment about MCCI's findings and have not publicly commented on the report since it was released.
Since the quake, other problems have taken root, such as a spate of burglaries. The thieves picked locks and broke down doors, prompting some people to reoccupy their homes, according to owners of the apartments and police officers who requested anonymity. 
Although his brother reclaimed his apartment, Ignacio Melo has yet to return. He lives in a small wooden shack, hastily built near a park where he used to walk. 

""We've already been to many authorities, but no one listens to us,"" he said.

The survey by polling firm Ibope showed Bolsonaro, a former army captain who has tapped into Brazilian anger with rising crime and corruption, had 28 percent support, an increase of 2 percentage points from his figures last week. 
He was stabbed in a Sept. 6 assassination attempt that nearly ended his life and will prevent him from campaigning again before the Oct. 7 first-round vote.
Haddad registered 19 percent of voter intentions for the first round, a jump of 11 points from the previous Ibope survey, which was conducted before he officially replaced jailed former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on the ticket.
In the likely event of a second-round vote, Bolsonaro and Haddad would be in a dead heat, with both at 40 percent support among voters in a runoff, Ibope said.
In first-round voter intentions, center-left candidate Ciro Gomes stalled at 11 percent, and the favorite of investors, Geraldo Alckmin, dropped 2 points to 7 percent, while environmentalist Marina Silva fell 3 points to 6 percent.
The election will go to an Oct. 28 runoff vote if no candidate wins a majority in the first ballot.
The poll showed Bolsonaro had the highest rejection rate, at 42 percent, which could work against him in a runoff. Haddad had a 29 percent rejection rate, indicating his support had room to grow.
Bolsonaro has campaigned as the man who will sweep away political corruption and stop the return of the Workers Party, which many blame for Brazil's recent economic recession.
Haddad, a former Sao Paulo mayor, has presented himself as a moderate and is hoping to draw the votes of supporters of Lula, who is still Brazil's most popular politician despite being in jail for corruption and barred from running for office.

The poll interviewed 2,506 people from Sunday to Tuesday. It had a margin of error of 2 percentage points.

General Qamar Javed Bajwa is the most senior Pakistani figure to visit ally China since the new government of Prime Minister Imran Khan took office in August, and his trip comes a week or so after a senior Chinese diplomat visited Islamabad.
Pakistan has deepened ties with China in recent years as relations with the United States have frayed.
Bajwa may be hoping to smooth out any Chinese alarm at comments last week by Pakistan's commerce minister, Abdul Razak Dawood, who suggested suspending for a year projects in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the Pakistan leg of China's Belt and Road Initiative that includes recreating the old Silk Road trading route.
On Tuesday, Zhang Youxia, a deputy chairman of China's powerful Central Military Commission which President Xi Jinping heads, reiterated to Bajwa that the two countries are ""all weather"" strategic cooperative partners.
""China-Pakistan military ties are an important backbone of relations between the two countries,"" said Zhang according to a statement by China's Defence Ministry late on Tuesday.
""The two militaries should further pay close attention to practical cooperation in all areas, keep raising the ability to deal with various security risks and challenges, and join hands to protect the common interests of both countries.""
However, Zhang cited Xi as saying that the Belt and Road initiative should be a benchmark for China-Pakistan ties.
He said China appreciated the new Pakistan government's platform of fully promoting the relationship and that China was willing to work with the new government to push construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.
Beijing has pledged to invest about $60 billion in Pakistan for infrastructure for the Belt and Road project.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's incoming financial intelligence chief said it was ""shameful"" how little had been done about bribes that Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht executives said were paid to secure Mexican public works contracts, and vowed to reexamine the case once in office.
Santiago Nieto will head the finance ministry's Financial Intelligence Unit, which analyzes suspicious financial records, once the new leftist government takes office on Dec. 1. He said in an interview last week that the unit had been misused for political ends, without elaborating. 
""It's shameful that Mexico and Venezuela are the only countries in Latin America that haven't sanctioned anyone,"" he said of the Odebrecht case, which is at the heart of Brazil's Lava Jato, or Car Wash, corruption investigation that has reverberated across the region in recent years.
""In the case of Odebrecht, and in any other case, the first thing we would have to do is review what there is in the Financial Intelligence Unit related to the case,"" he said. Nieto does not yet have access to files and records kept by the unit.
In Brazil, Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] executives admitted to paying bribes within Mexico. Prosecutors in Mexico have said they are probing business between the Brazilian conglomerate and state oil company Pemex [PEMX.UL].
Pemex has declined to comment on issues related to Odebrecht, citing the ongoing investigation. The office of Mexico's attorney general, the finance ministry and the Financial Intelligence Unit all declined to comment for this story. Odebrecht acknowledged receipt of an emailed request for comment, but did not respond further.
Anger at widespread corruption scandals, including the alleged bribes from Odebrecht, a lucrative house deal involving the family of President Enrique Pena Nieto, and hundreds of millions of dollars siphoned from government coffers through fake contracts, helped leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador win a landslide presidential victory in July.
Lopez Obrador pledged in his manifesto to clamp down on financial crime, and tighten money laundering, banking and tax regulations. He has given few details of how he will achieve this, but promises to set an example of probity from the presidency.
Tasked with helping to prevent and fight money laundering and terrorism financing, the financial intelligence unit receives and analyzes information that it should then pass on to prosecutors to investigate and construct a case.
A former lead prosecutor for electoral crimes, Nieto was dismissed in 2017 on the grounds that he broke a code of conduct when he gave an interview about his investigation into Odebrecht bribery during the 2012 presidential campaign.
Nieto has admitted his mistake, but denies breaking rules or revealing sensitive information. He said his firing was illegal.
Last month, two incoming administration officials told Reuters that Odebrecht may be blocked from participating in public works projects under the new government. 
Odebrecht responded that wrongdoing at the company should not be used to impose sanctions against it in Mexico. 
CORRUPT SYSTEM?
Nieto said he would press for more information sharing between federal departments that investigate tax, electoral and organized crime, and investigate possible corruption within the system.
""I have the impression that there is a factor of internal corruption,"" he said, without providing specifics.
The Financial Action Task Force, an international organization that sets global standards for fighting illicit finance, said earlier this year that in Mexico ""financial intelligence does not often lead to investigations of money laundering, underlying crimes, and terrorist financing.""
Following the report, Mexico's finance ministry and the attorney general's office issued a joint statement recognizing shortcomings and promising to improve efforts.
However, the Mexican government seized just 871 million pesos ($46.3 million) and $14.7 million between September 2017 and June 2018, and began just one criminal proceeding, according to official statistics.
Nieto, who called the outcomes ""terrible,"" pointed to the financial intelligence unit and attorney general's office as the two ""bottlenecks"" holding back cases. 

""It is a matter of impunity, a complicit government, and a lack of political will to fight corruption,"" Nieto said.

""We are near to achieving the orderly withdrawal that is the essential basis for building a close future partnership,"" May wrote.

EU leaders are due to meet in Salzburg in Austria on Wednesday and Thursday for talks that U.K. Brexit minister Dominic Raab has said would be an ""important milestone"".
Raab said the government is sticking to its proposal for a post-Brexit border between its province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland, one of the major obstacles to an agreement. [nL8N1W412I]
On Tuesday, the EU's Brexit chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the bloc was ready to improve its proposal for an ""insurance policy"" backstop arrangement on how to manage the Irish border after Brexit. [nL8N1W46ND]
""FRICTIONLESS MOVEMENT""
May wrote in Die Welt that a hard border either between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland or between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K. would threaten peace and stability on the island.
""To avoid a hard border we need the frictionless movement of goods. This is not the same thing as partial participation in the Single Market: British companies would not enjoy the same legal rights, for example,"" she wrote.
""So that frictionless movement is at the heart of the new proposals we put forward this summer,"" she added.

The New York Times reported on Sept. 8 that U.S. officials had met with rebellious Venezuelan military officers, leading Maduro to accuse U.S. President Donald Trump's administration of seeking an intervention and supporting a coup.
The U.S. National Security Council responded at the time that U.S. policy preference was for ""a peaceful, orderly return to democracy in Venezuela.""
Venezuela's economy has collapsed under Maduro, with annual inflation running at 200,000 percent, and staple foods and basic medicine increasingly difficult to obtain.

The EU has called her Chequers plan, named after May's country residence where a deal was hashed out with ministers earlier this year, a good starting point but has baulked at her proposals for a future customs arrangement and Northern Ireland.
With just over six months before Britain leaves the EU, time is pressing and May is keen to secure some kind of deal before the end of the year and ease concerns over a disorderly exit, which could plunge the economy into a downturn.
A senior Downing Street source said she would repeat her message at a meeting of EU leaders in Salzburg on Wednesday and Thursday that Britain was proposing ""a fair arrangement that will work for the EU's economy as well as the UK's"".
And she pressed her message home in an article written in Germany's Die Welt daily newspaper for publication on Wednesday.
""We are near to achieving the orderly withdrawal that is an essential basis for building a close future partnership,"" May wrote. ""To come to a successful conclusion, just as the UK has evolved its position, the EU will need to do the same. 
""With goodwill and determination on both sides we can avoid a disorderly exit and find new ways of working together.""
NORTHERN IRISH CONUNDRUM
While both sides have been making positive noises about the Brexit talks, there has been no deal yet over one of the biggest obstacles - how to meet their aim of keeping an open border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland.
But EU officials are also minded not to paint May into a corner, aware that she faces increasing opposition to her plans in her Conservative Party and needs a victory of sorts to try to persuade a reluctant parliament to back a deal.
Earlier on Tuesday, EU negotiator Michel Barnier said the bloc was ready to improve its proposal for an ""insurance policy"" backstop arrangement on how to manage its Irish border.
May rejected a previous plan, saying it would effectively slice Northern Ireland away from mainland Britain.
""Neither side can demand the unacceptable of the other, such as an external customs border between different parts of the United Kingdom – which no other country would accept if they were in the same situation,"" she wrote.
Reiterating that Britain is committed to a ""legally operative protocol on Northern Ireland"", the source said May would again underline that such an agreement must respect her country's integrity, ""which the Commission's proposal does not"".
Suggesting that Britain was being more reasonable about its demands, May will again try to reassure the EU that she is not trying to undermine its founding principles by opening a backdoor to its lucrative single market.
""What we are proposing is a fair arrangement that will work for the EU’s economy as well as the UK’s, without undermining the single market,"" she wrote.

""This would be balanced by a strong security relationship to keep all our citizens safe from threats at home and abroad.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States is considering a request from Poland for a permanent U.S. military presence in the fellow NATO country, acknowledging that he shares Poland's concerns about possible Russian aggression.
Polish President Andrzej Duda asked Trump for a permanent U.S. base during a White House meeting, offering to name it ""Fort Trump,"" and explaining it would be a bulwark against what he considers a threat from Russia.
Trump said he agreed with Duda that Moscow had ""acted aggressively"" in the region and said the request for a base was under consideration. He said he appreciated Duda's offer to put more than $2 billion into the project.
""We're looking at it very seriously, I know Poland likes the idea very much, and it's something that we are considering, yes,"" Trump told reporters.
Moscow expressed concern in May over reports about Poland's request, saying NATO’s expansion toward Russia’s borders undermined stability in Europe.
Poland joined NATO in 1999 along with Hungary and the Czech Republic, and since then other former communist states, including Baltic republics bordering Russia, have joined despite Moscow’s strong opposition.
Poland has repeatedly requested a permanent U.S. military presence on its soil. The United States currently rotates troops through Poland temporarily but permanently stationing forces there would be expensive because of costs that can include housing for families, schools and hospitals.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the U.S. military was studying options with Poland but cautioned that no decisions had been made.
""It’s not just about a base. It’s about training ranges, it’s about maintenance facilities at the base, all these kinds of things. There’s a host of details we’ve got to study alongside the Poles,” Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon.
Trump and Duda also expressed shared concerns about Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline which they said could make Europe overly reliant on Moscow for energy and expose it to the risks of what Duda called ""political blackmail"" with shipments.
But Trump said the United States was not looking to sanction companies that participated in the project with Russia. ""We just think it's very unfortunate for the people of Germany that Germany is paying billions and billions of dollars a year for their energy to Russia,"" he said.
In a joint statement released later on Tuesday, after the press conference, Trump and Duda said they will continue coordinating efforts ""to counter energy projects that threaten our mutual security, such as Nord Stream 2.""

Trump also said the United States was considering a visa waiver program for Poland.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's ex-President Cristina Fernandez said on Tuesday that she never received corrupt payments and challenged investigators to scour her home region of Patagonia if they believed she had hidden cash, a day after she was indicted on graft charges.
Using her immunity as a senator to refuse to answer any questions, Fernandez handed a written statement to the federal judge investigating a sprawling bribery scandal that has ensnared dozens of former officials and construction company executives. The statement was published on her party's website.
""They can dig up all of Patagonia, but they will never find anything because I never received any illicit money,"" the statement said, citing official allegations that cash was kept in underground vaults at Fernandez's private residence or hidden in containers in the southern Argentina countryside.
Federal Judge Claudio Bonadio said in the indictment that officials had found empty vaults under the house, but no money.
Fernandez, president from 2007 through 2015, is accused of heading a network in which officials in her administration accepted bribes from construction companies in exchange for public works contracts. [nL2N1W31JD]
Known as the ""notebooks"" scandal, the allegations arose in August after a local newspaper published diaries kept by a former government chauffeur, who said his notes documented hundreds of millions of dollars delivered to the offices of Fernandez and her late husband and presidential predecessor Nestor Kirchner.
""There is no evidence that links me to this alleged network,"" Fernandez's statement said.
Fernandez was previously indicted on corruption charges in 2016 after her former public works secretary was caught trying to hide bags of cash in a convent.
Fernandez's current position as a senator grants her immunity from arrest, but not from investigation.
The probe has implications for next year's presidential election. President Mauricio Macri is expected to run for a second term in October 2019, and his arch political rival Fernandez is among his possible challengers from the country's Peronist movement. But the scandal is expected to limit her chances.
Some 85 percent of Argentines expect corruption to ""decrease substantially within the next five years,"" a recent survey by the International Federation of Accountants said. 
""The optics do not look good for Fernandez's re-election prospects,"" said Jose Arnoletto, President of the Argentine Federation of Professional Economic Scientists.

968,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 05:50PM ET</span>","Pro-EU campaigners map out path to second referendum, say Brexit can be stopped","LONDON (Reuters) - Pro-EU campaigners have set out how parliament could force the British government to call a fresh vote on Brexit, arguing that there is still time for another referendum.
Britain's narrow 2016 vote to exit the EU still divides public opinion with less than seven months until the country is due to leave the bloc. Prime Minister Theresa May is struggling to win support at home and in Brussels for her exit plan.
May has rejected the idea of a second referendum on leaving the EU, but the campaign for a so-called ""People's Vote"" on whether to accept any deal that May is able to agree, has won support from some in parliament.
In a report co-authored by the man who drafted the EU treaty clause Britain is using to exit the bloc, the People's Vote campaign said parliament would have a series of opportunities to encourage or force the government to hold a referendum. 
""The die is not irrevocably cast, there is still time,"" said John Kerr, who wrote the Article 50 exit clause of the EU's Lisbon Treaty that May used in March 2017 to set a two-year countdown running on Britain's departure.
The campaign cited polling data from YouGov showing more people would back a second vote than oppose one. Most opinion polls show a slight shift away from voting for Brexit, but overall opinion remains basically split down the middle.
The report set out six scenarios under which parliament could fight the government - ranging from technical procedures that would turn a planned vote in parliament on approving her deal into a one calling for a public vote, to the collapse of her government and a new election.
All rely to some extent on May, who does not have an outright majority in parliament, failing to win over skeptical lawmakers within her own party.
""The combination of parliament having meaningful votes, together with the government’s lack of a reliable majority, means that MPs (Members of Parliament) will play a central role in scrutinizing any deal and could yet reject it,"" the report said.
The government has agreed to let lawmakers vote on whether to accept any deal May is able to negotiate with Brussels. But her negotiating plan is unpopular within her divided party, and it is not clear that she will be able to win a vote on it.
Nevertheless, May said that if her deal is rejected by parliament, Britain will leave the bloc without any deal - an outcome that many economists, including the International Monetary Fund, say would damage the economy.
Some pro-Brexit lawmakers argue that the dangers of leaving without a deal are being hyped up to generate fear, while both May's government and the EU have published no-deal contingency plans to try to mitigate any impact.

969,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 05:16PM ET</span>",Doubts arise over whether Trump court nominee's accuser will testify,"By Lawrence Hurley and Richard Cowan
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A woman who has accused President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault decades ago has not yet agreed to testify at a U.S. Senate hearing set for next Monday, raising questions about whether the high-stakes public showdown will take place.
Christine Blasey Ford, a university professor in California whose allegations have put Kavanaugh's once-safe nomination in jeopardy, has not responded to attempts by the Republican-led Senate Judiciary Committee to contact her about appearing at the hearing, committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said on Tuesday.
Trump stepped up his defense of Kavanaugh and expressed sympathy toward his nominee, who met with officials at the White House for a second straight day though not with the president.
""I feel so badly for him that he's going through this, to be honest with you,"" Trump told a news conference. ""... This is not a man that deserves this.""
""Hopefully the woman will come forward, state her case. He will state his case before representatives of the United States Senate. And then they will vote,"" Trump added.
The hearing represents a potential make-or-break moment for the conservative federal appeals court judge's confirmation chances for the lifetime post on the top U.S. court, as Trump pursues his goal of moving the federal judiciary to the right.
Ford has accused Kavanaugh of trying to attack her and remove her clothing while he was drunk in 1982 in a Maryland suburb outside Washington when they were students at different high schools. Kavanaugh has called the allegation ""completely false.""
Republicans control the Senate by only a narrow margin, meaning any defections within the party could sink the nomination and deal a major setback to Trump.
Senator John Cornyn, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, appeared to cast doubt on Ford's allegations.
""We just don't know what happened 36 years ago and there are gaps in her memory. She doesn't know how she got there, when it was, and so that would logically be something where she would get questions,"" Cornyn told reporters.
Cornyn's fellow Republicans have generally avoided criticizing Ford, instead castigating Democrats for not revealing her allegations earlier.
The confirmation fight comes just weeks before the Nov. 6 congressional elections in which Democrats are seeking to take control of Congress from Trump's fellow Republicans, which could be a major blow to his agenda. 
Grassley, whose committee oversees the confirmation process, initially said the planned hearing would be public but other Republicans indicated it could be held privately if Ford requests that.
Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, urged Republicans not to ""rush the hearings.""
Democrats, already fiercely opposed to the nominee, wrote a letter to Grassley objecting to the planned format of the hearing, which was announced on Monday, including having just Kavanaugh and Ford as witnesses.
'DESERVES TO BE HEARD'
""We have reached out to her in the last 36 hours, three or four times by email, and we've not heard from them. So it kind of raises the question ... do they want to come to (the) public hearing or not?"" Grassley said in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt.
""I want to hear from Dr. Ford,"" Grassley said. ""And she deserves to be heard because these are serious accusations. And I would surely hope she'd come Monday.""
Ford detailed her allegation in a letter sent in July to Senator Dianne Feinstein, the committee's top Democrat. The letter's contents leaked last week and Ford identified herself in an interview with the Washington Post published on Sunday that included details about the alleged assault.
Debra Katz, a lawyer representing Ford, said in television interviews on Monday that the professor would be willing to testify and called the alleged incident ""attempted rape."" Katz did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Democrats have so far also refused to cooperate with the committee's Republican leadership. They have asked that the FBI conduct an investigation, a request that Republicans have rebuffed. Trump and other Republicans said they do not think the FBI needs to be involved.
Feinstein said there should be more than just two witnesses, possibly to include people who Ford previously confided in. The committee's Democrats said witnesses should include Kavanaugh's friend Mark Judge, who Ford has said witnessed the alleged incident.
A lawyer representing Judge sent a letter to Grassley saying Judge does not want to speak publicly about the matter.
""In fact, I have no memory of this alleged incident. Brett Kavanaugh and I were friends in high school but I do not recall the party described in Dr. Ford's letter. More to the point, I never saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford describes,"" the letter quoted Judge as saying.
Judge is the author of a 1997 memoir titled ""Wasted: Tales of a Gen X Drunk,"" which recounts his experiences as a teenage alcoholic.
One Democratic senator, Richard Blumenthal, said Kavanaugh should withdraw his nomination.
""I believe Dr. Ford. I believe the survivor here,"" Blumenthal said. ""... She has come forward courageously and bravely, knowing she would face a nightmare of possible and vicious scrutiny.""
Republican staffers quizzed Kavanaugh about the allegations on a call on Monday evening in which the Democrats refused to participate. Committee spokesman Taylor Foy said other witnesses would be questioned ahead of the hearing.
The showdown has echoes of current Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' contentious confirmation hearings in 1991 involving sexual harassment allegations lodged against him by a law professor named Anita Hill. Thomas, the court's second black justice, was ultimately confirmed, but only after a nasty televised hearing in which Hill faced pointed questions from Republican senators and the nominee said he was the victim of ""a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks.""
Grassley offered his assurance that Ford would be treated respectfully and not badgered during the hearing. All 11 Republicans on the committee are men. Four of the Democrats are women. 

Trump picked Kavanaugh in July to replace retired conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy.

Activists who include members of the Rastafarian movement and traditional healers greeted the ruling with loud applause. They have held marches over the years to demand that the law be changed to allow people to smoke 'weed', which is called 'dagga' in South Africa.
Several government departments, including the health and justice ministries, oppose its legalization and warn of harmful effects.
But in a unanimous judgment read by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, the Constitutional Court decriminalized home consumption, saying ""the use of cannabis must be for the personal consumption of the adult"". The ruling also approved growing marijuana for personal consumption. 
Rastafarian Garreth Prince and former Dagga Party leader Jeremy Acton brought the case asking the High Court to allow for the home use of marijuana. 
Jules Stobbs and Myrtle Clarke‚ known as the ""Dagga Couple"", joined the case, and asked the court to strike down laws banning the use‚ cultivation and sale of marijuana.
He added that it would not be a criminal offence for an adult person to use or be in possession of cannabis in private for their personal consumption in private.
However, the judgement did not specify the amount that can be used by an adult in private use.
""This must be determined by parliament,"" he said. 
Parliament is now expected to amend the laws that criminalize cannabis following the court ruling.
Activists had argued that the criminalization of dagga use and possession is a violation of the right to equality, dignity, and freedom of religion.

There was no immediate comment from the departments over the country's top court ruling on Tuesday.

The Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthi group denied reports that it had carried out the attack. 
Members of the fishermen's families told Reuters only one person survived when a warship attacked the boat. 
The Saudi-led coalition denied attacking the boat and said an unknown vessel opened fire on the fishermen, killing 17.
""The command of the coalition forces assures that what some media reported about the coalition's navy targeting fishing boats off al-Khoukha port is baseless,"" the coalition spokesman, Colonel Turki al-Malki, said in a statement.
He accused the Houthis of carrying out similar attacks in the past.
The coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened in Yemen in 2015 to restore the exiled government of president Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, but the Houthis still control most populated areas, including the capital Sanaa and the port city of Hodeidah, 120 km (75 miles) along the coast from Al-Khoukha.
Heavy fighting resumed in Hodeidah last week as pro-government forces launched an assault to retake the city.
Al-Khoukha port is under the control of the UAE military, which drove out the Houthis last December and where they built a military base used in the battle for Hodeidah.
Al-Malki said the coalition was investigating the incident and had gathered information from fishermen present in the area and the one who survived the attack.
Coalition-backed Yemeni forces last week said they seized the main road linking Hodeidah to Sanaa as part of a strategy to isolate the two cities, both held by the Houthis, who denied the claim.
U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths left Sanaa on Tuesday after a three-day tour aimed at convincing the Houthis to send representatives to Geneva for consultations that could lead to a peace agreement.
""Constructive meetings in Sanaa with Ansarullah (Houthi) leadership ... made progress on ways to resume consultations and confidence building measures, including release of prisoners, economic situation and re-opening of Sanaa airport,"" Griffiths' office said on Twitter.
He will be in Riyadh on Wednesday, his office added.
The Houthis did not show up in Geneva for talks earlier this month after they said their plane should be provided by a neutral party and should not be inspected by the coalition. They also asked to evacuate some of their wounded to Oman or Europe.

Khan, on his first foreign trip since taking office last month, also plans to visit the United Arab Emirates, the Saudi Ministry of Media said.
Pakistan is trying to avert a balance of payments crisis stemming from a large current account deficit, and analysts have said they expect it to sign up for what would be its 13th bailout package from the International Monetary Fund since the late 1980s.
But Finance Minister Asad Umar said last month that an IMF rescue was a fallback option and that the government was exploring other avenues for assistance. That was broadly interpreted as seeking help from China and Saudi Arabia, which have both provided Islamabad with vast loans in the past.
In 2014, six months after Pakistan obtained its last IMF bailout, Saudi Arabia loaned it $1.5 billion that the
government used to strengthen its rupee currency.
Umar and Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi are accompanying Khan on the Gulf trip.
Pakistan's foreign office said Khan would discuss ""issues of bilateral interest"" with Saudi Arabia's King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 
Pakistan's current account deficit widened 43 percent to $18 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30, while the fiscal deficit has ballooned to 6.6 percent of gross domestic product.

Khan's government came to power on the back of assurances to root out corruption and reduce poverty. On Tuesday it announced tax increases for middle and high-income earners and a spike in import duties on luxury products in a bid to raise 183 billion rupees ($1.48 billion) in additional revenue.

The 52-year-old former chancellor, whose party lost power last year, is known for his strongly pro-European stance. 
""We see that the concept of a liberal, open-minded democracy is greatly challenged by the Orbans, the Kaczynskis, the Straches and the Salvinis,"" he told reporters in Vienna.
He was referring to a string of nationalist politicians - Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the leader of Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, Austria's far-right Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache and Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini.
""It is the most important challenge for us Social Democrats to ensure that Europe's heritage is preserved,"" Kern said in his short statement.
Kern's move to Brussels could help the image of the Austrian Social Democrats, who have been too preoccupied with internal struggles since the election to provide strong opposition to the conservative-far right coalition led by Sebastian Kurz.

Kern said he would resign as national party leader in May at the latest to fully focus on his new task. It is not yet clear who will replace him.

""We are ready to improve this proposal,"" Barnier told reporters after briefing EU ministers on his talks ahead of a summit of EU leaders in Salzburg on Wednesday and Thursday.
""Work on the EU side is ongoing, we are clarifying which goods arriving in Nothern Ireland from the rest of the UK would need to be checked. Where, when and by whom these checks could be performed,"" he said. 
""Most checks can take place away from the border, at company premises, or the market,"" Barnier said of customs and regulatory checks on goods that might move from the British mainland to Northern Ireland, which the EU has offered to keep inside the EU economic space after Brexit to avoid border friction.
Aware that British Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out a new ""border"" between the province and the British mainland, Barnier said he was looking at a broad range of ways in which the EU could be sure that Britain did not use Northern Ireland's special status to sidestep EU controls on British goods.

But, also conscious of Irish worries about a possible political fudge on the issue, he stressed that the backstop must be ""legally operational"" and said a summit in Brussels on Oct. 18 would be a ""moment of truth"" for whether a deal was possible before Britain leaves the EU, deal or no deal, next March.

""It's then that we shall see whether the agreement we are hoping for is within our grasp,"" Barnier added.

MOSCOW/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that the shooting down of a Russian military plane near Syria's seacoast was the result of a series of tragic and chance circumstances.
His comments appeared to somewhat defuse a possible crisis involving outside powers that back opposing sides in Syria's complex civil war, after Russia's Defence Ministry accused Israel of indirectly causing the incident.
The ministry said that while Syrian anti-aircraft had mistakenly shot down the plane of a close ally, Israeli jets flying nearby had put the Russian jet in the path of danger, and it threatened to retaliate over what it called a hostile act. 
Putin told reporters: ""It looks most likely in this case that it was a chain of tragic chance events, because an Israeli aircraft did not shoot down our aircraft. But, without any doubt, we need to seriously get to the bottom of what happened.
""As for retaliatory measures, they will be aimed first and foremost at further ensuring the safety of our military personnel and facilities in Syria. And these will be steps that everyone will notice,"" Putin said.
He also told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone that Israel's air force had been conducting operations in breach of Syria's sovereignty, a Kremlin statement said.
""In this case, Russian-Israeli agreements on the prevention of dangerous incidents were not observed. As a result a Russian airplane came under fire from Syria's anti-aircraft systems. The President of Russia called for the Israeli side to avoid such situations from now on,"" the statement said.
Russia's Defence Ministry said the Il-20 reconnaissance aircraft, with 15 Russians on board, was downed by Syrian government anti-aircraft guns in a ""friendly fire"" incident.
But the ministry said it held Israel responsible because, at the time of the incident, Israeli jets were attacking targets in Syria and had only given Moscow one minute's warning, putting the Russian aircraft in danger of being caught in cross-fire.
""We view the actions of the Israeli military as hostile,"" Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov told Russian state television. ""As a result of the irresponsible actions of the Israeli military, 15 Russian service personnel perished.""
Netanyahu's office said that in his conversation with Putin he blamed Syria for the aircraft's downing but offered ""all necessary information"" for the investigation into the incident. 
(Syria areas of control https://tmsnrt.rs/2JCynMn) 
Any dispute between Israel and Russia could crimp Israel's ability to carry out air strikes inside Syria on what it sees as the greatest threat to its security from the war - build-ups of Iranian forces or groupings of the Shi'ite Hezbollah militia. 
Since intervening in Syria in 2015, Russia has usually turned a blind eye to Israeli attacks. Israel has launched about 200 such raids in the last two years, Israeli officials say.
Amos Yadlin, Director of Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies, said on Twitter the downing of the Russian plane could ""limit the bid to stop Iran’s entrenchment in Syria and the transfers of advanced weapons to Hezbollah.""
""INACCURATE"" SYRIAN ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE
In a statement the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) also voiced sorrow at the deaths but blamed the Syrian government and its main regional allies Iran and Hezbollah. 
The IDF said the initial Israeli inquiry into the incident found ""extensive and inaccurate"" Syrian anti-aircraft fire ""caused the Russian plane to be hit and downed"".
""The Syrian anti-air batteries fired indiscriminately and from what we understand, did not bother to ensure that no Russian planes were in the air,"" the statement said.
It added that by the time the Russian plane was struck, the Israeli jets were already back in their own airspace. The Russian plane was ""not within the area of the operation"" carried out by the Israeli jets, it said.
After the incident, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told his Israeli counterpart, Avigdor Lieberman, that Moscow held Israel wholly responsible, Russian news agencies reported. 
In his conversation with Putin, Netanyahu's office said, the prime minister stressed the importance of defense coordination with Russia that had managed ""to prevent many losses on both sides in the past three years"" in Syria's war.
""COVER"" 
Moscow said its plane disappeared from radar as it came in to land at the Hmeymim air base in western Syria late on Monday.
According to the Russian Defence Ministry, Israeli F-16 jets carrying out air strikes used the Russian plane as cover to allow them to approach their targets on the ground without being hit by Syrian fire.
""Hiding behind the Russian aircraft, the Israeli pilots put it in the line of fire of Syrian anti-aircraft systems. As a result, the Il-20 ... was shot down by the (Syrian) S-200 missile system,"" the ministry's Konashenkov said.
He said the Israeli pilots ""could not have failed to see the Russian aircraft, as it was coming in to land from a height of 5 km (three miles). Nevertheless, they deliberately carried out this provocation,"" Konashenkov said. ""This absolutely does not correspond to the spirit of Russian-Israeli partnership.""
The Israel military said that overnight its fighter jets had ""targeted a facility of the Syrian armed forces from which systems to manufacture accurate and lethal weapons were about to be transferred on behalf of Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon"".
It said the weapons targeted in the Mediterranean coastal city of Latakia ""were meant to attack Israel and posed an intolerable threat against it"".
Several countries have military operations under way around Syria, with forces on the ground or launching strikes from the air or from ships in the Mediterranean. 
Foreign powers involved in the conflict - including Israel and Russia - operate hotlines to exchange operational details to avoid one side accidentally attacking the other's forces. However, diplomats and military experts have warned that the risk of inadvertent strikes is high.
Separately, Turkey said on Tuesday it would send more troops into Syria's rebel-held Idlib province after striking a deal with Russia that has averted a government offensive there.

Many youths burnt tires and hurled stones at Israeli security forces, local residents said. A doctor at Gaza's Indonesian Hospital said both men were hit by live ammunition, one in the chest and the other in the back. Three of the wounded were hit by bullets.
Earlier, two other men found dead near the site of an Israeli missile strike at the coastal strip's border with Israel on Monday were identified as Palestinian cousins, family members said.
The Israeli military said it had attacked a group suspected of tampering with the border fence.
Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintains tight control of its land and sea borders and has fought three wars there in the past decade against Hamas Islamist militants that control the territory.
With Egypt, Israel has imposed a blockade that the World Bank says has brought Gaza's economy to crisis, leaving its 2 million people with limited access to health care, clean water and electricity.
Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been stalled for several years and Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, where the Palestinians hope to establish an independent state, have expanded.
The border between Gaza and Israel has been the scene of weekly Palestinian demonstrations since March 30. At least 181 Palestinians have been killed in the protests, according to Palestinian health officials.

The Israeli army says it is defending its border against rioting protesters who have sought to breach the fence and enter Israel.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's government said on Tuesday it would replace the head of its domestic intelligence agency who has faced accusations of harboring far-right sympathies, putting an end to a row that exposed divisions in Chancellor Angela Merkel's government.
Hans-Georg Maassen, who had questioned the authenticity of video footage showing far-right radicals hounding migrants in the eastern German city of Chemnitz, will become a senior official at the interior ministry once he leaves the BfV agency, the government said in a statement.
The center-left Social Democrats (SPD), junior coalition partners of Merkel's conservative bloc, had wanted Maassen removed from the post he has held since 2012.
Horst Seehofer, leader of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), the sister party of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), had stood behind Maassen.
""Interior Minister Horst Seehofer values (Maassen's) competence on questions of public security,"" the government statement said. ""Mr Maassen will not be in charge of supervising the BfV at the ministry.""
The deal allows each of the three parties to claim it got what it wanted. But opposition parties were quick to denounce the deal as a face-saving measure that effectively amounted to a promotion for Maassen.
Leftist lawmakers have accused Seehofer of undermining the credibility of the BfV agency by refusing to fire Maassen.
'IT'S A FARCE'
They also accuse Seehofer of being reluctant to act for fear of strengthening the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has also stood behind Maassen and is expected to steal conservative voters from the CSU in a regional election next month in Bavaria.
""Maassen is no longer the top spy. This is good. But it is a farce that he is practically being promoted and that the SPD is going along with this,"" said Dietmar Bartsch of the hard-left Die Linke party.
SPD leader Andrea Nahles faced a backlash from members of her party furious at the decision to retain Maassen as a senior civil servant.
""The so-called agreement on Maassen is a joke,"" Florian Post, an SPD lawmaker in the Bavarian regional assembly, told the RND newspaper group. ""Either the man is fit to hold high office or he isn't.""
Maassen's comments on the video pictures contradicted Merkel's own assessment. She said they ""very clearly revealed hate"" which could not be tolerated. 
The far-right violence, the worst seen in Germany in decades, followed the fatal stabbing of a German man that was blamed on two migrants. Earlier on Tuesday a German court released one of the men, an Iraqi, though a Syrian man remains in custody and a third suspect is being sought. 
Merkel has been criticized for taking 11 days to act on Maassen, whose comments on the far-right violence in Chemnitz during an interview with mass-selling Bild newspaper on Sept. 7 triggered the row.
The violence in Chemnitz exposed deep divisions in Germany over Merkel's 2015 decision to open the country's doors to around a million people seeking asylum, mainly Muslims from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
That decision has also been blamed for fuelling the rise of the AfD, which became the largest opposition party after an election last year that weakened both Merkel's conservatives and the SPD. It is expected to come third in Bavaria on Oct. 14.

On Tuesday the AfD said removing Maassen as head of the BfV agency posed a threat to national security.

British-based rights body Human Rights Concern - Eritrea (HRCE) said Berhane Abrehe, minister from 2000 to 2012, was arrested on Monday morning in the capital Asmara.
HRCE said Abrehe had in two books ""detailed how the president of the country is responsible for suffering of the Eritrean people and called upon the Eritrean youth to rise up for democratic change"".
President Isaias Afwerki has led Eritrea since independence from Ethiopia in 1991. He has won international plaudits in the past weeks for agreeing to put aside two decades of hostility with arch-foe Ethiopia and restore relations. 
The Eritrean information minister could not be immediately reached for comment about the arrest. It was not possible to contact Abrehe or a lawyer representing him.
Neither HRCE nor Sheila B. Keetharuth, U.N. Special Rapporteur on human rights in Eritrea, specified the charges he was facing or what had triggered his arrest.
But Keetharuth criticized the detention which she said meant ""improvements in Eritrea's external relations are not mirrored inside, especially regarding respect for fundamental rights and freedoms"".
""People imprisoned in Eritrea, some for excessively long periods and others arrested more recently, should be brought before the courts of law as a matter of urgency,"" she said.
The United Nations has previously accused officials in the Horn of Africa country of crimes against humanity including torture, rape, murder and enslaving hundreds of thousands of people.
In 2016, when the allegations were made, the government rejected them and said they were an attempt to harass the country. 
The rapprochement with Ethiopia followed its prime minister Abiy Ahmed's move to accept an international ruling on the two countries' disputed border that sparked war in 1998. 
In the two decades that followed both countries were dominated by their militaries and a constant security obsession meant criticism and political opposition was suppressed.

The scandal has forced the Academy to cancel this year's Literature prize, which would have been announced next month, and has thrown it into its worst crisis since its founding more than 200 years ago by the Swedish king.
Jean-Claude Arnault, 72, who is married to a member of the Academy, has been charged with two counts of rape against a woman in Stockholm seven years ago.
Arnault's lawyer says he denies the allegations. Arnault has also denied unrelated allegations of being the source of leaks of the names of some past winners before the formal announcements.
Prosecutors closed another preliminary investigation into a number of abuse allegations against Arnault earlier this year, citing insufficient evidence and because for some the statute of limitations had expired. He has been accused by 18 women of sexual harassment and assault.
Two of the Academy's 18 members have resigned over the institution's handling of the crisis. Several - including Arnault's wife - are not taking part in the Academy's work as a consequence of the row but have not formally resigned.
After cutting ties with Arnault, the Academy held a vote on whether to exclude his wife from the body for allegedly breaching conflict of interest rules and divulging names of prize winners to her husband, who could then leak them. 
The motion failed but prompted the series of departures.
With the headcount down to only 10 and statutes saying 12 are needed to vote in new members, previous Permanent Secretary Sara Danius and two other members who have effectively left the Academy have said they are willing to take part in important votes such as filling vacant seats.
Until earlier this year when King Carl XVI Gustaf revised the rules, members of the Academy were not allowed to resign.

Several workers were wounded and police fired stun grenades to disperse the crowd in Manzini, the country's second biggest town and industrial center, according to a Reuters witness, as demonstrations which organizers said would continue until Thursday also took place in the capital Mbabane, Siteki and Nhlangano. 
There were no reports violence or injuries in those three towns.
Formerly known as Swaziland, the landlocked southern African country of 1.4 million is one of the world's poorest nations and the continent's last absolute monarchy.
It has witnessed three sets of protests by public servants seeking better pay, education and healthcare since April, when the pension fund contributed $70,000 to lavish birthday celebrations for King Mswati III. 
The king is accused by critics and rights groups of using the public purse to fund his family's lavish lifestyle, which he denies.
A union leader said they planned to present a petition to the government on Thursday demanding that probe into the circumstances of the birthday payment, which the cabinet ended in June, be reopened.
In Mbabane on Tuesday, a man addressed onlookers through a megaphone from a car that was driven around the city, urging them to join the protest.
National Police Commissioner Isaac Magagula said on Monday that protesters should not provoke police, which Njabulo Dlamini, a union leader, said on Tuesday his members had not done.
Police and the government spokesman were not available for further comment.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Fifty years after creating the Che Guevara poster that still adorns student bedrooms around the world, Irish artist Jim Fitzpatrick is delighted at its ubiquity, but concerned at its exploitation for commercial gain. 
Fitzpatrick created the image in 1968 from a photograph of the Argentine Marxist revolutionary taken in 1960 by Cuban photographer Alberto Korda, and made it available for free to anyone who wanted to use it. 
It was quickly adopted by left-wing movements, appearing on T-shirts, posters and leaflets, but has also been used by companies to brand products - something that annoyed Fitzpatrick and pushed him to reclaim the copyright in 2010.
""It didn't bother me at first, I couldn't give a hoot who was doing T-shirts,"" he told Reuters.
""But when a big commercial company, like a cigarette company, who have literally stolen my image, produce cigarette packs with my image twisted around the other way, left to right, as though that solves the copyright problem, then I have severe problems, because I detest that kind of commercial exploitation."" 
Speaking in his home studio in Sutton, north of the Irish capital Dublin, Fitzpatrick recounted how the image was created.
""I did a couple of posters of it, but the one that matters, the red and black one that everyone is familiar with, the more iconic one, that was done after (Guevara's) murder and execution while a prisoner of war, for an exhibition in London called Viva Che,"" he said, referring to Guevara's death at the hands of Bolivian forces in 1967. 
""The Che is very simple. It's a black and white drawing that I added red to. The star was painted by hand in red,"" he said, displaying a large print of the image. 
""Graphically, it's very intense and straightforward, it's immediate, and that's what I like about it.""

Fitzpatrick said he offered the copyright of the image to the Guevara family, who have not yet returned the documents necessary for him to turn it over to them, and that he may bequeath it to a local charity instead.

989,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 12:03PM ET</span>",EU ministers question Poland over rule of law concerns,"By Jan Strupczewski and Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Poland's right-wing government sought to explain itself to its European Union peers on Tuesday for the second time in three months on Tuesday amid concern over changes to the judiciary that the EU believes undermine it's courts' independence.
Polish Minister for European Affairs Konrad Szymanski said on entering the hearing before EU ministers in Brussels that he would defend changes to the judiciary brought by the eurosceptic PiS government. He is facing a tough task.
In a joint declaration delivered by German Minister of State Michael Roth in the name of France and Germany at the start of the hearing, the two biggest EU countries said that despite numerous discussions already held with Warsaw, concerns over on the rule of law in Poland have not dissipated.
""On the contrary, since July 3rd and the implementation of the new retirement regime for Supreme Court judges, the situation has become more urgent than ever,"" delegation sources quoted Roth as telling the hearing.
The hearing is part of the bloc's procedure, called Article 7, used against countries that violate fundamental rights and the rule of law. 
The process first allows EU governments to give a formal warning to a country accused of violating fundamental rights but ultimately could end in suspending its EU voting rights.
Poland's situation echoes that of Hungary, which the European Parliament last week sanctioned for flouting EU rules on democracy, civil rights and corruption.
The process was triggered by the European Commission because the Polish government has enacted laws forcing into early retirement many Supreme Court judges, and it trying to replace them with its own nominees. 
As a result Poland was suspended on Monday from the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary (ENCJ), which decided the Polish council is no longer independent because it is now appointed by politicians, rather than judges as before.
The forced retirement of judges has been criticized by EU institutions, human rights groups and the opposition as going against the rule of law. The Supreme Court itself has asked the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court, to rule if the early retirement was legal, but an ECJ ruling may take months.
In the meantime, the Polish Supreme Court ruled that the proposed PiS changes should be frozen until the ECJ ruling is made. However, President Andrzej Duda, who is backed by the PiS, has moved to appoint new Supreme Court judges nonetheless.
""As we observe, in the last weeks, first steps are being taken to replace the Supreme Court Judges,"" Roth said.
This was problematic, he said.
""We hope that Poland acts constructively and does not take actions which cannot be changed afterwards,"" he said. 
The PiS has already replaced many judges at the Polish Constitutional Tribunal and the heads of regular courts. Since coming to power in late 2015, it has also tightened its grip on public media and controls over non-government groups.
The legal paralysis of the Polish Supreme Court also poses additional difficulties because it is the institution that declares the validity of elections in the country of 38 million people. Poland is due to hold local elections in October.
In August, the European Commission stepped up its legal case against Poland taking a formal infringement procedure against Warsaw to a second level, giving Poland one month to reverse the changes or face a trial at the ECJ.

But Warsaw has made no concessions and the Commission is expected to file a lawsuit against it at the ECJ on Wednesday.

990,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 11:52AM ET</span>",Anti-Kremlin activist saved by prompt treatment: doctors,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Anti-Kremlin activist Pyotr Verzilov would probably have died following an apparent poisoning in Moscow last week if he had not received prompt medical treatment, his doctors in Germany said on Tuesday.
Verzilov, publisher of a Russian online news portal with close ties to the outspoken activist group Pussy Riot, is still very disoriented as he convalesces in Berlin's Charite hospital following what his ex-wife said was either an assassination attempt or a warning shot.
Doctors at the hospital said Verzilov was suffering from anti-cholinergic syndrome, a condition in which the passage of certain neurotransmitters is blocked, the sudden onset of which was strongly indicative of poisoning.
""I don't believe his position was seriously life-threatening in hospital, but we can imagine an unfavorable outcome if he'd been alone at home,"" Kai-Uwe Eckardt, the doctor treating him in Berlin, said.
Verzilov, known in Russia for protest stunts including a pitch invasion at the World Cup final, was treated in a Russian hospital for four days last week before being flown to Berlin for further care.
Activists and security services are on high alert for poison attacks with origins in Russia following the poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in Britain earlier this year, blamed by London on Moscow.
Jaka Bizilj, a Germany-based activist who helped arrange Verzilov's treatment there, said Verzilov had not stopped hallucinating his cat Rubinstein in the hospital room, and had taken one of his Berlin doctors for a prison warden. ""But he's getting better every day.""
At a press conference given by Verzilov's mother, his partner and his former wife, Pussy Riot founder Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Tolokonnikova said Verzilov might have been targeted by law enforcement agencies embarrassed by his stunts.
""Probably it was an assassination attempt and if not it was intimidation,"" she told journalists on Tuesday, adding that she thought the Canadian-Russian dual citizen would return to Russia after an expected full recovery.
""No one who is taking part in political activities in Russia right now can really be safe,"" added Tolokonnikova, who herself became a worldwide figure of dissent when she and two bandmates were jailed for performing a song critical of President Vladimir Putin in a Moscow cathedral.
She credits her then-husband for keeping the case in the international spotlight while she was imprisoned from 2012-2013. They later divorced but have remained close.
Verzilov was taken ill on Sept. 11 after accompanying his partner Veronica Nikulshina to a court hearing in Moscow. She described taking him to hospital after finding him unwell, pupils widely dilated, after he had taken to bed.
Doctors at the Charite hospital said the rapid onset of symptoms - including high blood pressure and dry mucous membranes - strongly indicated poisoning, but it was almost impossible to identify what poison had been used so long after it was administered.

Verzilov was no longer in danger but still needed intensive medical care, the doctors said. His care was being paid for by his Canadian medical insurance.

A court ruled this month that prosecutors in the northern city of Genoa could seize some 49 million euros from accounts and businesses belonging to the party following a fraud investigation.
The courts have already recovered almost 4 million euros, but many League bank accounts were discovered to be empty and magistrates are investigating whether other funds may have been shifted abroad illegally to avoid detection.
The League, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, has denied this, and some senior party figures had warned that the court ruling could force the group, which rules in coalition with the anti-establishment 5 Star Movement, to disband.
Since the inconclusive nationwide election in March, when the League won 17 percent of the vote, Salvini has dominated Italy's political agenda with an aggressive and popular campaign against immigration. 
The head prosecutor in Genoa, Franco Cozzi, said Tuesday's deal would guarantee the continued existence of the League, while also ensuring that the state recovered the misappropriated funds. The League is still appealing the original ruling.
Up to 2013, each Italian party was entitled to state electoral funding partly based on the number of parliamentary seats it had. Opposition parties have accused the League of defrauding the state.
Prosecutors started to hunt down the money last year after the League's founder and former leader, Umberto Bossi, was convicted of illegally using party funds from 2008 to 2010.

The AfD, the main opposition in parliament, has capitalized on voters' fears about the integration of more than 1.5 million refugees in the last three years and has blamed conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door migrant policy. 
The AfD in the northern state of Lower Saxony called on three members to leave the party or face exclusion after allegations that they visited a neo-Nazi festival in Saxony to celebrate Adolf Hitler's birthday on April 20, several German media reported.
Dana Guth, head of the local parliamentary group, told Germany's dpa news agency that the three had admitted they had taken part in the rock festival in Ostritz.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra decision to trigger a legislative procedure that could allow him to dissolve Congress is not a power grab but a constitutional way to pressure lawmakers to pass urgent reforms, his foreign minister said in an interview.
Nestor Popolizio defended Vizcarra's decision to summon a vote of confidence in his Cabinet as part of the president's efforts to fight graft and strengthen institutions, denying allegations by opposition lawmakers that it was authoritarian.
Accusing lawmakers of stalling his core reforms, Vizcarra late Sunday called for the vote of confidence as a way to move four bills to clean up the judiciary and Congress in response to an influence-peddling scandal that triggered street protests. 
Under Peru's constitution, if Congress delivers a vote of no confidence, Vizcarra would have to replace his entire Cabinet but he could also dissolve Congress and call for legislative elections.
The heightened tensions between Congress and the president have ushered in a new period of political uncertainty in one of Latin America's most stable economies.
""I know this legal framework doesn't exist in other countries. That's why it may create a certain type of confusion or interpretation,"" Popolizio told Reuters late Monday after Vizcarra's decision drew international attention.
""But it's an absolutely democratic process that adheres to the Peruvian constitution,"" he said.
Popilizio's remarks hinted at concerns within Vizcarra's six-month-old government about how the dispute might be playing out abroad. The last time a president closed Congress in Peru was in 1992, during the authoritarian rule of Alberto Fujimori.
It was Fujimori who passed the current constitution in 1993, giving presidents strong powers to check Congress. His daughter Keiko Fujimori now leads the conservative opposition party, Popular Force, which has an absolute majority in Congress.
Popular Force lawmakers have said other matters are more pressing than Vizcarra's proposed reforms, such as rebuilding regions affected by severe flooding last year.
The party criticized Vizcarra's request for the vote of confidence as unconstitutional on Monday, with some lawmakers accusing him of trying to stage a legislative coup d'etat.
But Popolizio said Vizcarra's political strategy was just as constitutional as Popular Force's push to remove former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski from office under Article 113 of the constitution on grounds he was not morally fit to govern.
Congress' first vote to push out Kuczynski failed but the former Wall Street banker resigned on the eve of a second ballot.
""The question of confidence as well as the presidential vacancy procedures are covered in the constitution,"" Popolizio said. ""They are by nature democratic. They are precisely part of the democratic game that exists in the country.""
Popolizio said Peru's economy was ""growing and will continue to grow at some of the best rates in the region,"" and Vizcarra's bid to ensure passage of his proposed reforms will only help.
""These are good signs for investors,"" Popolizio said. ""If you have a judiciary that's working properly and solid institutions, what you have is legal security encouraging investment.""

Vizcarra's prime minister is expected to address Congress on Wednesday to ask lawmakers to pass the reforms and renew confidence in the Cabinet.

BERLIN (Reuters) - A German court on Tuesday released an Iraqi asylum seeker detained last month over the fatal stabbing of a Cuban-German man that set off violent protests by far-right radicals, his lawyer and a prosecutor said.
A Syrian man who was also detained over the stabbing of the man remains in custody, the prosecutor said.
A third suspect is still on the run and prosecutors think he and the Syrian were involved in killing the 35-year-old carpenter, in the eastern city of Chemnitz, the prosecutor said.
The Iraqi's lawyer complained about his client's detention.
""Today's revocation of the arrest warrant was long overdue,"" lawyer Ulrich Dost-Roxin wrote in a post on his website. ""My client Yousif A. has had to spend more than three weeks in remand without any concrete suspicion.""
He and the Syrian had been named as the main suspects in the killing, which sparked violent xenophobic protests and led to a scandal centered on Germany's domestic spy chief, whose fate is being contested in a tug-of-war at the highest levels of government.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and coalition leaders meet on Tuesday to decide the future of Hans-Georg Maassen, head of the BfV domestic intelligence agency, after he questioned the authenticity of video footage of far-right protesters chasing migrants in the streets of Chemnitz.
The center-left Social Democrats - junior partner in Merkel's coalition government - want him to go, but Maassen has support from Merkel's Bavarian partners. Whichever way Merkel leans, it could create trouble within her government.
The Maassen row has exposed deep divisions in German society over Merkel's 2015 decision to open the country's borders to refugees fleeing wars in Syria and elsewhere. More than one million have come since then.
Their arrival has fueled support for far-right groups such as PEGIDA and the Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is now the main opposition party in parliament.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's ruling coalition of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and far right League party will pay no regard toward ex-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's influential media empire, a 5-Star minister said on Tuesday.
The League governs with 5-Star but remains part of a center-right alliance with Berlusconi at the regional level, giving rise to widespread speculation that Salvini will do nothing to offend his long-standing ally.
However, Barbara Lezzi, the 5-Star minister for Italy's economically deprived south, said on a television show that the government must cap advertising ceilings to ensure greater media competition, despite Berlusconi's interests.
""We will not make gifts to Berlusconi. We'll go ahead with our reforms over the advertisement ceilings,"" Lezzi told state channel RAI 3.
Berlusconi's media realm, which includes three national television stations, radio stations, a major publishing house and numerous magazines, has exerted considerable influence on Italian politics since he first became prime minister in 1994.
League leader Matteo Salvini met Berlusconi at the tycoon's villa near Milan on Sunday and Italian media reported that Berlusconi obtained ""guarantees"" over his business interests.
5-Star has always been a fierce adversary of Berlusconi, creating potential tensions in the ruling coalition that formed a government following inconclusive elections in March. 
Berlusconi's party, Forza Italia ('Go Italy'), and the League ran together at the election. Forza Italia voted against the new executive after Salvini did a deal with 5-Star, but did not break up its political alliance at the local level.
The two parties govern together in many Italian cities and regions, including the wealthy Lombardy region around Milan.
But relations between Berlusconi and Salvini have deteriorated since the election and in August Forza Italia blocked the appointment as chairman of state broadcaster RAI of eurosceptic journalist Marcello Foa, who had been proposed by the League and 5-Star. 
RAI is the country's biggest television group and competes with Mediaset, the company controlled by Berlusconi's family.
In what was seen by some as a retaliatory move, Vito Crimi, a senior 5-Star official, said last week the government was planning to introduce ceilings on TV advertising, which would hit Berlusconi's earnings.

Foa, who used to work for Berlusconi's family newspaper, has been criticized by the center-left for his strong eurosceptic and pro-Russia stances.

Soini attended the event in Ottawa in May with his deputy, who posted a picture on Twitter, prompting calls from the opposition for Soini's resignation. 
Finland is known for pioneering gender equality. The law allows abortion and the government is committed to promote women's rights in its foreign and security policy.
Parliament is due in the coming days to hold a no-confidence vote brought by some opposition parties over Soini's behavior, but, despite some criticism from his government colleagues, it is unlikely to pass due to the coalition's majority.
Chancellor of Justice Tuomas Poysti, who supervises the legality of the actions of the government and president, said it was ""problematic"" for a minister, especially for one who communicates official foreign policy, to take a stance against abortion during a work trip.
""Under these kind of circumstances, the foreign minister should follow particular carefulness and considered abstinence in his statements ... so that his conduct would not give any reason for misunderstandings,"" Poysti said in a statement.
He added, however, that Soini, a Catholic, had not breached the law and would face no further action from the watchdog.
On Tuesday, Soini, who attended the event during his free-time on the official trip, defended his freedom of religion but said he would take the watchdog's conclusion seriously.
Soini has said he turned to Catholicism in 1988 because he considered Evangelic Lutheran Church of Finland too soft on female priesthood and abortion. 
He is opposed to gay marriage and has repeatedly criticized abortion and commented on votes about abortion overseas.
His previous party, the Finns, was kicked out of the center-right government last year after it elected more radical anti-immigrant leaders.

It then broke apart as Soini and some other lawmakers formed a new group, the moderately national Blue Reform, to stay in the ruling coalition.

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwean opposition lawmakers walked out of President Emmerson Mnangagwa's state of the nation address to parliament on Tuesday, signaling their lingering bitterness after losing a disputed July 30 presidential and parliamentary election.
Members of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) that is led by Nelson Chamisa heckled Mnangagwa when he started reading his speech before filing out.
Chamisa - who is not a member of parliament and lost a court challenge to Mnangagwa's win last month - maintains that he was cheated of victory by the electoral board and says the 76-year-old president lack legitimacy.
After leaving parliament, the MDC lawmakers broke into song denouncing the ruling ZANU-PF party. ""As the MDC we cannot sit there and be addressed by a person who does not even respect the rule of law,"" MDC national chairperson Tabitha Khumalo told Reuters.
ZANU-PF's chief whip in parliament Pupurai Togarepi described the lawmakers' conduct as unfortunate, adding: ""We hope that over time they will come to their senses, it's not about grandstanding but building the country together."" 
Mnangagwa, who has previously called for unity among political parties to help rebuild the shattered economy, said the elections were now in the past. 
""The election period is decisively behind us. It is now time for us as members of parliament and political leaders to exert our efforts toward delivering promises we made to the electorate,"" Mnangagwa said in his speech.
The president promised to bring a series of bills to parliament, including on giving more power to Zimbabwe's 10 regions, revamping the process of registering companies and creating a one-stop investment agency.
A mining amendment bill passed by parliament in June, which removed clauses requiring foreign mines to list their shares on the local stock market, would be brought back to the assembly to fix ""inadequacies"" and provide for online registration of mining rights and titles.
Mnangagwa, who came to power in November after Robert Mugabe was removed in a coup, faces the huge task of ending Zimbabwe's international pariah status and fixing an economy afflicted by high unemployment and foreign currency shortages.
He told lawmakers that his government had negotiated $500 million in foreign credit facilities, some of which would be disbursed to companies this week.

Mnangagwa, however, said the country would not immediately re-introduce its own currency that was dumped in 2009 after it was made worthless by hyperinflation of 500 billion percent.

Muhammad Lukman Mohamad, a 29-year-old father of one, was convicted of trafficking in cannabis, a crime punishable by death in Malaysia. He was sentenced to death by hanging on Aug. 30 and has filed an appeal, his lawyer, Farhan Maaruf, told Reuters. 
During the trial, Muhammad Lukman testified that he had only sold cannabis oil to help patients suffering from illnesses such as cancer and leukemia, Farhan said. 
The case sparked a debate over the use of marijuana for medical purposes, with many, including some lawmakers, calling for amendments to the country's harsh drug laws. 
A Change.org petition, which urged the attorney-general to free Muhammad Lukman, has garnered nearly 45,000 signatures. 
Asked about the case, Mahathir told reporters it should be reviewed.
""No, I think we should review that,"" he was quoted as saying in a video recording of his comments seen by Reuters. 
Nurul Izzah Anwar, a member of parliament from Mahathir's coalition, said she would be writing a letter calling for the attorney-general to reconsider the conviction and penalty for Muhammad Lukman.
""From the reports, it looks to be a miscarriage of justice,"" she said.
The attorney-general's office did not immediately respond to a request for comments.
Malaysia, like other countries in Southeast Asia, imposes harsh penalties for drug offences. Last year, parliament voted to remove the death penalty as mandatory punishment for drug trafficking and leave it to the judges' discretion instead.
Earlier this year, an Australian mother of three was sentenced to death for trafficking more than a kilogram of crystal methamphetamine into Malaysia.

In the Mea Shearim neighborhood of Jerusalem and in other cities around Israel, religious Jews said prayers as they performed the traditional rite with the birds, which then go to slaughter. 
The participants called for forgiveness, symbolically passing their sins to the doomed bird while calling it ""my substitute, my atonement"". 
Most participants used white chickens. A small number chose to use a darker-colored bird. The slaughtered chickens are generally donated to the poor.
The custom is intended to symbolize the cleansing of sins in the build-up to the 'Day of Atonement' the period of fasting and prayer that is observed by Jews the world over.
In Ashdod, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, some also performed the ritual known as Tashlich, in which people empty their pockets into a source of water, casting their sins out to sea.

The worshippers threw bread on to the sea to draw fish toward them, so that they can symbolically bear the sins away.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan left for Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, the foreign office said, amid speculation he may be seeking economic assistance from a staunch ally instead of another IMF bailout. 
Khan, on his first international visit since taking office last month, was accompanied by Finance Minister Asad Umar and Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi at a time when the country is trying to avert a balance of currency crisis stemming from a large current account deficit.
Analysts say a fresh bailout package from the International Monetary Fund, which would be its 13th since late 1980s, is inevitable.
But Umar recently said an IMF rescue was a ""fallback option"" and that the government was exploring other avenues for assistance, which was broadly interpreted as Islamabad seeking help from China and Saudi Arabia, both of which have provided vast loans in the past.
""The Prime Minister will call on His Majesty King Salman and hold a bilateral meeting with the Crown Prince,"" Pakistan's foreign office said in a statement. ""The two leaders will discuss issues of bilateral interest.""
In 2014, six months after Pakistan obtained its last IMF bailout, Saudi Arabia loaned Pakistan $1.5 billion, which the government used to strengthen its rupee currency.
Pakistan's current account deficit widened 43 percent to $18 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30, while the fiscal deficit has ballooned to 6.6 percent of the economy.
Khan's government came to power on the back of populist assurances to root out corruption and reduce poverty. Since taking office, the government has initiated a number of symbolic austerity measures while promising social welfare reforms. 
The government on Tuesday announced tax increases for middle and high-income earners and a spike in import duties on luxury products in a bid to raise 183 billion rupees($1.48 billion) in additional revenue.

PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday promised extra money and more doctors in rural areas to ease pressure on France's hospitals, which are creaking under the weight of budget constraints and closures of clinics outside towns and cities.
Spending on healthcare will increase by 2.5 percent in 2019, higher than the initial 2.3 percent target and amounting to an additional 400 million euros ($470 million) in a near 200 billion euro budget, Macron said.
""Without changes, the hospital system will collapse,"" Macron said in a speech at the Elysee Palace. ""We need to rethink how we organize healthcare for the next 50 years.""
France's public healthcare system is considered one of the world's best, but an ageing population and financial constraints have put it under strain. 
Patients increasingly complain of overcrowded emergency rooms and, in rural areas, travel times to the nearest clinic, while nurses frequently bemoan a shortage of beds and staff shortages.
Macron's announcement came days after he unveiled a separate 8 billion euro plan to fight poverty in France, where some 8.8 million people live below the poverty threshold.
Long in the planning, Macron hopes his social reforms will help counter criticism from left-wingers that he is a president of the rich and help turnaround a sharp fall in popularity. 

Macron also promised the recruitment of 4,000 medical assistants to handle paperwork and free-up doctors in urban areas to treat patients.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. would be capped at 30,000 for fiscal year 2019, a sharp drop from a limit of 45,000 set for 2018.
""Decisions on which refugees will be resettled and where they go are made solely by the governments of countries that, like the United States, admit refugees for resettlement,"" UNHCR spokesman William Spindler told a regular U.N. briefing in Geneva.
Pressed repeatedly to say whether UNHCR was disappointed by the announcement by the U.S., its biggest donor and the world's top recipient of refugees, Spindler declined to answer.
“I have said what I have to say,” he said.
The refugee ceiling of 45,000 set last year was the lowest since 1980, when the modern refugee program was established. The U.S. is on track to admit only 22,000 refugees this year, about half the maximum allowed.
Trump campaigned in 2016 promising tight restrictions on immigration, and his administration has sharply reduced refugee admissions through executive orders and closed-door decisions in the past year and a half.
In January, he questioned why the United States would want immigrants from ""shithole"" countries, according to sources familiar with his comments.
UNHCR has been sounding the alarm for years about the growing number of people forcibly displaced around the world, which stood at 68.5 million at the end of 2017, including 25.4 million refugees who had fled their countries to escape conflict and persecution. 
Spindler said about 8 percent of refugees were vulnerable people needing resettlement, but the actual number resettled was less than 1 percent, and the number of places offered had never matched the needs, even before the lower U.S. limit.
Pompeo said the new limit reflected the administration's preference for settling refugees closer to their home countries, something Trump has said would be cheaper than admitting them to the U.S.
It was also based on security concerns, Pompeo said. 
Spindler said the United States had a very long and rigorous screening process. 
""It includes eight U.S. government agencies, six separate security databases, five background checks and three in-person interviews,"" he said.

1006,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 06:49AM ET</span>",Merkel takes a gamble with new immigration law,"By Michael Nienaber
BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel hopes a new immigration law will make it easier for foreign workers to find jobs in Germany, but her push to fill a record number of vacancies risks angering voters who still resent her open-door refugee policy.
With an aging population and a shrinking workforce, Germany needs greater flexibility to fill more than a million empty positions, business leaders say.
""We will continue to depend on foreign professionals,"" Merkel said in the Bundestag last week, defending her immigration plans against criticism from opposition politicians.
""Companies should not be leaving the country because they can't find staff,"" Merkel said, adding that many entrepreneurs were more concerned about hiring skilled workers than getting tax relief.
The new law to be discussed by Merkel and her cabinet later this month aims to attract workers from outside the European Union, although they will need a professional qualification and German language skills when applying for a work visa, according to a paper drawn up by officials.
Government officials see the law, which is welcomed by employers, as a game-changer in the global race for talent since other countries are espousing stricter immigration rules.
But it could anger voters who feel left behind after Merkel's decision to welcome more than a million refugees in 2015.
An opinion poll this month showed 51 percent felt her government did not take Germans' concerns about immigration seriously. In eastern Germany, the figure was 66 percent. 
There are regional elections next year in the eastern states of Saxony, Brandenburg and Thuringia, where the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is expected to make strong gains at the cost of Merkel's conservatives and her center-left coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD).
INFLUX
The unprecedented 2015 influx of asylum seekers, mainly from Muslim countries such as Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, has already caused popular anger and propelled the AfD, which rejects the new immigration law, into the national parliament.
Deep divisions became apparent last month in the eastern city of Chemnitz, scene of violent far-right protests after migrants were blamed for the fatal stabbing of a German man.
Referring to Chemnitz, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, leader of the Christian Social Union, Merkel's Bavarian sister party, described migration as the ""mother of all political problems"" in Germany.
Merkel may escape a political backlash if she can convince voters the new law will address specific labor shortages and not increase overall competition in the jobs market.
""If she can credibly make the point that this is about Germany's economic self-interest, it won't fuel angst among those who already feel alienated in their own country,"" said Gero Neugebauer, a political expert at Berlin's Free University.
""But if not, then this law will backfire on Merkel, especially taking into account that there are three local elections next year in eastern Germany,"" he said.
There are also regional elections next month in Bavaria and Hesse, where the rise of the AfD could make it harder to form coalition governments.
Allowing even more foreigners into the country is a risk for Merkel - even if the labor force in Europe's biggest economy is forecast to shrink drastically and can only be stabilized with net immigration of 400,000 people every year until 2060. [http://tmsnrt.rs/2edwT7n]
Due to a prolonged economic upswing, job vacancies have hit a record high of 1.2 million while unemployment is at its lowest since German reunification in 1990, according to the Labour Office. [http://tmsnrt.rs/2edwT7n]
Labour shortages cost the economy up to 0.9 percentage points of output every year, according to the IW German Economic Institute.
STRUGGLING
Among companies struggling to find staff is Eyeem, a Berlin start-up that connects millions of photographers globally with agencies and clients through an online platform.
""We're 100 percent affected by labor shortages,"" Eyeem's personnel chief, Michael Jones, said at the company's headquarters in Kreuzberg, a multicultural Berlin district that is home to many European immigrants.
""We're struggling to fill numerous vacancies in areas such as software engineering and sales,"" Jones said. In some cases, it can take six months for a foreign candidate to get the green light from immigration authorities.
In one case, Eyeem wants to hire a specialist from Egypt but is still awaiting final confirmation. This makes it hard for Eyeem to plan and for the Egyptian worker to get on with moving to Germany.
Other sectors affected by labor shortages are construction, education, child care and geriatric nursing.
Arno Schwalie, chief executive of nursing home operator Korian in Germany, says the number of elderly people needing permanent care will rise by more than a quarter over the next 15 years.
""By then, we might have to deal with a shortage of more than 250,000 workers in the care sector,"" Schwalie said. ""Qualified immigrants can help close this gap. This is not the only solution, but part of the solution.""
Health Minister Jens Spahn has said young people from Kosovo and Albania could help fill 50,000 geriatric care vacancies.  
Labour unions say nursing homes could attract local workers by improving pay and conditions.
The AfD rejects the new law, saying it will encourage immigration and lead to ""wage dumping"" at the expense of less-educated locals.
""If you look at the very small wage rises, then you don't need to be an expert to say that there actually is not a lack of skilled workers,"" AfD lawmaker Uwe Witt said.
Merkel stresses that the immigration law is accompanied by a 4 billion euro program to help Germany's 800,000 long-term unemployed find work.
CHANGE
While a growing number of the 2015 migrants are finding jobs, the process is slow given the urgency of the need for workers. It takes three to five years for a poorly-educated Syrian or Iraqi to learn German and get a professional qualification.
In addition, the coalition parties disagree over whether refugees should be allowed to shed asylum status if they have found a job and learned German.
The conservatives say this will encourage immigration by asylum seekers without the right skills. The SPD want a more pragmatic approach.
""It's about preventing a situation where we send back the right people - and then have to painstakingly search for skilled workers abroad,"" SPD Labour Minister Hubertus Heil told Reuters.
A compromise floated by officials envisages that only asylum seekers currently in Germany can make the switch, with future refugees excluded.
Germany has become the second favorite destination for immigrants after the United States, attracting more than 1 million in 2016, according to OECD figures.
Of those, more than 600,000 are European Union nationals, who can choose where to live and work in the bloc.
But Germany expects these numbers to fall as the economic upswing in Europe means people can find work at home. In addition, the number of working age people in Europe is declining due to low birth rates.
""We must make full use of all the domestic potential. But this simply won't be enough, we also need skilled workers from countries outside Europe,"" said Ingo Kramer, president of the BDA employers' association.
For Kramer, Germany's economic future is at risk if the government fails to adopt a modern immigration law. For Merkel, the enterprise is part of her efforts to secure her legacy.

Clearing the $1.8 billion in arrears to the World Bank and African Development Bank is seen as a major step for Zimbabwe to start accessing foreign credit, especially for the private sector as well as foreign direct investment.
Ambassador Catriona Laing said an International Monetary Fund (IMF) program would help Britain's former colony expedite the clearance of its arrears. 
""We are here to give that support to try and encourage a process back to an IMF program, perhaps through an interim staff monitoring program as soon as possible,"" Laing told reporters.
She said this would enable Zimbabwe ""to start a serious dialogue"" around the clearance of the arrears.
Zimbabwe's finance minister Mthuli Ncube said President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government was still deciding whether to follow the Highly Indebted Poor Country route or a commercial deal to clear the arrears.
Only then would it come up with a timeline to pay the arrears, he said, adding that he would launch an economic stabilization program next month.
Zimbabwe, which is trying to shake off its international pariah tag, started defaulting on its foreign debt in 1999. The West put sanctions on the country in 2002 as punishment against former President Robert Mugabe's government, which was accused of vote fraud and rights abuses.
Mugabe, whose near four-decade rule ended after a coup last November, has maintained he was punished for seizing white-owned commercial farms to resettle blacks.
Laing said along with economic measures such as reducing the country's fiscal deficit, Britain also wanted Harare to carry out political reforms, including aligning the country's laws to a 2013 constitution.

""We will be tracking both pathways, the economic pathway and political pathway. We want Zimbabwe to succeed,"" Laing said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A Hindu nationalist group behind the rise of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is opening up to critics and supporters through a first-of-its-kind outreach program in New Delhi, preparing the ground for his re-election bid next year.
The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the fountainhead of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that believes in a Hindu-first ideology, provided thousands of campaigners for Modi's landslide victory in 2014, and could help energize its cadre to fend off rising criticism of the government.
A general election is due by May.
A three-day lecture session the RSS started on Monday in the capital - rare for a mainly male group that typically broadcasts its views from its headquarters in the western city of Nagpur - is also being seen as an attempt to mainstream the movement that Modi joined in his youth.
""We want to connect with a larger section of society, those who want to understand us, those who want to know us,"" Manmohan Vaidya, one of several RSS general secretaries, told Reuters.
""We are experiencing a growing curiosity among a large section of society.""
The RSS has been banned several times since its inception in 1925, once after a former member of the group assassinated independence hero Mahatma Gandhi in 1948.
That attack came after the RSS accused Gandhi of appeasing Muslims at a time when Pakistan, an all-Muslim nation, was being carved out of India. The ban was later lifted in the absence of any evidence the group planned the attack.
Bollywood stars, athletes and ministers attended the first day's event at a government convention center as the RSS sought to shed what its chief called a ""dictatorial"" image to an audience of about 1,300 people.
Its leaders and volunteers wore traditional Indian clothes, but the group's trademark attire of khaki trousers and white shirts was missing. 
A couple of years ago the RSS gave up its old-fashioned khaki shorts to raise its appeal among young people.
""Narendra Modi is a good man, works hard and leads a life of values, so the world has saluted him,"" Indresh Kumar, a senior RSS leader, told a gathering of supporters to discuss India's ""global march"".
""I keep saying that you gave 50 years to those who looted the country, now give 10 to 15 years to those who will make the country. That much patience you can have.""
OPENING FOR OPPOSITION
India's Congress party ruled the country for much of its independent history, but a big loss to the BJP in the last general election has forced it to seek partnerships with other opposition parties in a bid to stall Modi's march in 2019.
Record-high fuel prices, low crop prices https://in.reuters.com/article/india-election-farmers/farmers-protest-disrupts-delhi-as-opposition-targets-modi-idINKCN1LL15Bdue to oversupply and a lack of jobs have given the opposition a chance to reconnect with voters ahead of state polls in three big BJP-ruled states, ahead of the general election.
Kumar urged his audience to use social media and other ways to convince voters that Modi was a better bet than any candidate for prime minister the opposition could offer.
In the last general election https://in.reuters.com/article/uk-india-politics-hindu/modis-nationalist-foot-soldiers-take-centre-stage-in-india-idINKBN0E70R020140527, hundreds of thousands of volunteers of the RSS, which has about 585,000 committed members, used technology and sheer manpower to mobilize voters.
Kumar said there was a need to mobilize young people, women, and rural people to ensure Modi's victory.
""A lot of things have been done and lot may have been unfinished. There's no magic wand,"" he said.

""If we want to march ahead on the world stage, we will have to be in Delhi. If we trip in the bid to come back to Delhi, our global ambitions will also slip.""

1010,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 18, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>","Syrian rebels see Idlib deal as victory, Damascus as test for Turkey","AMMAN/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian opposition officials praised a deal between Russia and Turkey over Idlib province on Tuesday, saying it had spared the rebel-held region a bloody government offensive and would thwart President Bashar al-Assad's aim of recovering all Syria.
Damascus, while welcoming the agreement unveiled on Monday, vowed to press on with its campaign to recover ""every inch"" of the country. Its ambassador to Lebanon said the deal would test Turkey's ability to deliver on promises to disarm rebels.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, Assad's most powerful ally, and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan agreed at a summit on Monday to create a demilitarized zone in Idlib from which ""radical"" rebels must withdraw by the middle of next month.
The agreement has diminished the prospects of a Syrian government offensive which the United Nations warned would create a humanitarian catastrophe in the Idlib region, home to about three million people.
The Idlib region and adjoining territory north of Aleppo represents the Syrian opposition's last big foothold in Syria, where Iranian and Russian military support has helped Assad recover most of the areas once held by the insurgency.
But strong Turkish opposition to an Idlib attack has obstructed government plans for an offensive, and the agreement announced on Monday appears to preserve a role for Turkey in the northwest - something seen as anathema to Assad.
""The Idlib deal preserves lives of civilians and their direct targeting by the regime. It buries Assad's dreams of imposing his full control over Syria,"" Mustafa Sejari, a Free Syria Army (FSA) official, told Reuters.
""This area will remain in the hands of the Free Syrian Army and will force the regime and its supporters to start a serious political process that leads to a real transition that ends Assad's rule,"" Sejari said.
The spokesman for the opposition Syrian Negotiations Commission said the deal had halted an offensive for which government forces had been mobilizing in recent weeks, calling it a ""victory for the will for life over the will for death"".
The ""scenario of attack is practically excluded, at least for a period of time that is not small, and we hope that it will be permanent,"" Yahya al-Aridi told Reuters by telephone.
Syria's ambassador to Lebanon, in an interview with Lebanon's al-Jadeed TV, reiterated his government's distrust of Turkey, a major backer of the Syrian rebellion which has deployed troops across the opposition-held northwest.
""I see it as a test of the extent of Turkey's ability to commit to implementing this decision. They are under pressure now and I believe they will try,"" Ali Abdul Karim said.
""We do not trust Turkey ... but it's useful for Turkey to be able to carry out this fight to rid these groups from their weapons...Turkey could deal with this responsibility and this would be useful,"" he said. 
The demilitarized zone will be monitored by Russian and Turkish forces, the leaders said on Monday.
Neither Putin not Erdogan explained how they planned to differentiate ""radically-minded"" rebels from other anti-Assad groups. It was also not immediately clear how much of the city of Idlib fell within the zone.
Putin said the decision was to establish by Oct. 15 a demilitarized area 15–20 km (10-12 miles) deep along the contact line between rebel and government fighters, with radical militants to be withdrawn from the area, including members of the Nusra Front, a jihadist group that now part of the Tahrir al-Sham organization. 
PRO-ASSAD NEWSPAPER SAYS SYRIAN STATE TO RETURN TO IDLIB
Al-Watan, a pro-Syrian government newspaper, said on Tuesday the zone would stretch for 15 km around Idlib city.
It also said Syrian state institutions would return to Idlib by the end of the year in the final phase of the deal after insurgents hand over all of their heavy weapons and move away from civilian areas.
Citing unidentified diplomatic sources in Moscow, it said any factions rejecting the agreement would be considered enemies ""even of the Turkish army and will be classed as terrorists that must be fought"".
Erdogan, who had feared another cross-border exodus of Syrian refugees to join the 3.5 million already in Turkey, said the deal would allow opposition supporters to stay where they were and avert a humanitarian crisis. 
Putin said that by Oct. 10, all opposition heavy weapons, mortars, tanks, rocket systems would be removed from the demilitarized zone, and said this was Erdogan's suggestion.
Earlier this month, Putin publicly rebuffed a proposal from Erdogan for a ceasefire when the two met along with Iran's president for a summit in Tehran.
Idlib is held by an array of rebels. The most powerful is Tahrir al-Sham, an amalgamation of Islamist groups dominated by the former Nusra Front - an al Qaeda affiliate until 2016.

Other Islamists, and groups fighting as the Free Syrian Army banner, are now gathered with Turkish backing under the banner of the ""National Front for Liberation"".

New fighting between armed groups erupted on Monday, ending a shaky truce brokered by the United Nations two weeks ago after more than 60 people had been killed in clashes since the end of August.
Power has been patchy since the first outbreak of violence, but since Monday night supplies have gone down all the way from Tripoli to the western border with Tunisia, the western mountains region and southern Libya, the power firm said in a statement.
It said a key power distributor was hit during the fighting in southern Tripoli where most of the clashes have taken place in the area of the former Tripoli International airport, which was destroyed in a different militia battle in 2014.
Tripoli and western Libya are technically run by a U.N.-backed government but in reality armed groups allied to it are in charge, fighting over access of public funds and business contracts.
Eastern Libya is controlled by a rival administration, part of a conflict that erupted in the oil producer after the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

The Vatican and China are in advanced talks to resolve a dispute over the appointment of bishops in China, one of the biggest obstacles to resuming diplomatic ties that were cut almost 70 years ago.
China's estimated 12 million Catholics are split between an underground Church that swears loyalty to the Vatican and the state-supervised Catholic Patriotic Association.
China's Global Times newspaper, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said there were no ""disputes on issues of principle"" between the two.
Since the previous meeting was held at the Vatican, the Vatican delegation would come to China this time for a meeting late September and ""if the meeting goes well, the agreement would be signed"", the paper cited, citing an unidentified source.
The talks have been controversial within the Catholic church.
The most outspoken critic of the pope's China strategy has been Cardinal Joseph Zen, a former bishop of Hong Kong, who has said the direction of negotiations suggests the Vatican is preparing to sell out the underground church.
China maintains a tight grip on religious groups, despite the government professing to guarantee freedom of belief.
Last month, Beijing's seniormost official for religion wrote that religious matters in China cannot be controlled by foreigners.
Another issue to be resolved is self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as a wayward province and with which the Vatican maintains formal diplomatic ties.

While restoring diplomatic relations were not part of the ongoing talks, full relations would give the church a legal framework to look after all of China's estimated 12 million Catholics and move on to focus on Catholic growth in a country where Protestant churches are already growing fast.

International banks and law firms operating in the global financial hub have been keen to see the easing of visas rules for partners in same-sex relationships in the interests of strengthening Hong Kong's ability to attract global talent.
The policy revision announced on Tuesday includes same-sex civil partnerships, same-sex civil unions, same-sex marriage, opposite-sex civil partnerships or opposite-sex civil unions entered into outside Hong Kong, the government said.
A dependent visa for such relationships would be considered so long as the person satisfied normal immigration requirements.
""The policy allows those who are able to provide care and financial support to their dependents to sponsor their non-local dependants to come to reside in Hong Kong,"" the government said.
""The policy also ensures that Hong Kong will continue to attract and retain people with the right talent and skills to come to and remain in Hong Kong by giving them the choice of bringing in their non-local dependents to live with them."" 
The revision, which was prompted by a Court of Final Appeal ruling in July, will take effect on Wednesday. 
Hong Kong's top court ruled in July that a British woman should be granted a spousal visa - which allows dependents to work without the need for a separate visa - after her partner was offered work in the financial hub. 
The pair had entered into a civil partnership in Britain.
The unanimous ruling by five judges brought to an end the case involving rights for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, which won support from more than 30 global banks and law firms, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Hong Kong is a popular destination for expatriates, many of whom work in the city's financial services and legal sectors.

Homosexuality was decriminalized in 1991, although marriage is legally defined as a monogamous union between a man and a woman. Hong Kong does not recognize same-sex marriage.

The United Kingdom is due to leave the EU in March next year, and so far no comprehensive agreement has been reached. One of the most difficult problems is how to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Britain's Dominic Raab told several European media outlets, including Germany's Spiegel Online, that Prime Minister Theresa May's economic and trade policy plan which would allow goods to cross the UK-Irish border was the only credible proposal. 
""These are so far the only proposals that guarantee smooth trade between Britain and the EU and take account of the specific problems in Ireland. I have seen no other credible alternative, either from here or from the EU side,"" Raab was on Tuesday quoted by Spiegel as saying.
He also said Britain will stick to its position that it will not allow a customs border to be established down the Irish Sea between it and Northern Ireland.
""Our position remains that we couldn't see a customs border down the Irish Sea and that the economic and the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom needs to be respected,"" he told the Irish Times newspaper.
However, he said they would listen to other suggestions.
""What I'm not going to do is prevent or say that we will not entertain any proposals, at least to consider in relation to anything, because actually we ought to be trying to at least listen to what the other side is saying,"" he added.
The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said earlier this month the bloc was open to discussing different ways of checking goods crossing the UK-Irish border, including technical checks on board vessels or in ports outside Ireland.
Both the EU and Britain want to avoid a hard border between UK's Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic as such a move could undermine a 1998 peace agreement that ended decades of sectarian conflict in the north.
It is, however, unclear how goods crossing between the EU and the UK in Ireland would be monitored if there was no border and if Northern Ireland, as a part of the UK, leaves both the customs union and the single market. 
Raab said the upcoming EU meeting in Salzburg, Austria, would be an ""important milestone"".
""We have already made extensive compromises.. We have shown ourselves to be very pragmatic and ambitious. Now the ball is in the European Union's court,"" Raab was quoted in Spiegel as saying, added there would be no second referendum on Brexit.

If lawmakers in parliament were to vote down any agreement, then there would probably be no deal.

Amiri heads the Fatih Alliance, an electoral bloc which came in second in May's inconclusive national election. His coalition has been vying to build the largest bloc which would form the government, with him as prime minister.
""I would like to announce to the dear Iraqi people the withdrawal of my candidacy for prime minister, to open the way for serious dialogue to elect a prime minister and his government according to the vision of the Supreme religious authority,"" he said in a news conference.
Amiri's Fatih alliance was composed of political groups tied to Iran-backed Shi’ite militias who helped government forces dislodge Islamic State militants from the third of Iraq they seized four years ago. His Badr Organisation controls the interior ministry.
Amiri's Alliance has been in advanced talks with Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr to form a new alliance in recent days. 

Sadr, whose Saeroon bloc scored a stunning victory in the May 12 parliamentary, portrays himself as a fierce nationalist opposed to both U.S. and Iranian interference in Iraq. He had formed an alliance with incumbent Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi since June, which looked set to falter.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian police said on Tuesday they are investigating reports of dozens of cases of needles embedded in strawberries and other fruits, and warned that those responsible could be jailed for 10 years.
The issue is fast turning into one of Australia's biggest ever food scares that has halted exports to New Zealand and forced at least one strawberry farm to start dumping its fruit at the peak of the season. Another farm is installing metal detectors, media reported.
The needles, originally found in strawberries produced from one supplier in the northern state of Queensland, are now turning up around the country. 
Police in New South Wales (NSW) state said on Tuesday needles had been found in more than 20 strawberry punnets, and there were reports that a banana and apple also had needles in them.
Police in other states are also investigating reports of similar sabotage, though they have not given details on the number of complaints.
""Any incidents of self-contamination or copycat incidents impact on the industry and are very unhelpful for authorities,"" NSW Detective Superintendent Danny Doherty told reporters in Sydney.
""They will be treated as contamination, which is a serious offense and carries 10 years in jail.""
One person has told media he suffered minor injuries to his mouth after biting on a strawberry with a needle embedded in it.
Previous contamination cases in Australia have led to arrests, but not convictions. 
In 2000, a man was accused of lacing paracetamol tablets with strychnine, prompting the tablets to be recalled nationwide. The suspect died in jail before being tried. 
In 2006, a case against a woman accused of contaminating salads at Sizzler restaurants with rat poison was deemed mentally unfit for trial.
The strawberry industry is worth A$160 million ($115 million), according to the sector, with most of the fruit consumed locally. A small amount of the crop is also consumed in New Zealand.
Both of New Zealand's biggest supermarket have halted Australian strawberry orders even though New Zealand's Ministry of Primary Industries has confirmed none of the contaminated strawberry brands has made it on to shop shelves.
Australian police said on Tuesday they had yet to identify a suspect or a motive.
While six brands have been directly affected and withdrawn from sale, consumers have begun to shun the fruit altogether.
Queensland state, the country's largest strawberry producing region, is particularly vulnerable to a sustained downturn in the market.
Its premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said on Tuesday the government would set aside A$1 million to help farmers survive the season. The state government is offering a A$100,000 ($71,950) reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the sabotage.

LONDON (Reuters) - Rapid population growth in some of Africa's poorest countries could put at risk future progress towards reducing global poverty and improving health, according to a report by the philanthropic foundation of Bill Gates.
Demographic trends show a billion people have lifted themselves out of poverty in the past 20 years, the report found. But swiftly expanding populations, particularly in parts of Africa, could halt the decline in the number of extremely poor people in the world, and it may even start to rise.
""Population growth in Africa is a challenge,"" Gates told reporters in a telephone briefing about the report's findings.
It found that poverty in Africa is increasingly concentrated in a few countries, which also have among the fastest-growing populations in the world. By 2050, it projected, more than 40 percent of world's extremely poor people will live in just two countries: Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria. 
Asked about the best ways of tackling the growing population and poverty challenge, Gates said improving access to birth control was key, and this should be combined with investment in young people's health and education.
""The biggest things are the modern tools of contraception,"" Gates said. ""If you have those things available then people have more control over being able to space their children.""
The report, entitled Goalkeepers, tracks 18 data points on United Nations development goals, including child and maternal deaths, stunting, access to contraceptives, HIV, malaria, extreme poverty, financial inclusion, and sanitation.
In its family planning section, the report called on policymakers to empower women to exercise the right to choose the number of children they have, when they have them, and with whom. 
According to U.N. data, Africa is expected to account for more than half of the world’s population growth between 2015 and 2050. Its population is projected to double by 2050, and could double again by 2100.
Yet if every woman in sub-Saharan Africa were able to have the number of children she wanted, the projected population increase could be up to 30 percent smaller, said the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's annual Goalkeepers report. 
This would also enable more girls and women to stay in school longer, have children later, earn more as adults, and invest more in their children, it added. Smaller families tend to be healthier and more productive.
""To continue improving the human condition, our task now is to help create opportunities in Africa's fastest-growing, poorest countries,"" the Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) founder and his wife wrote in the report. ""This means investing in young people.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un greeted Moon Jae-in with hugs and smiles on Tuesday as the South Korean president arrived in Pyongyang for a third summit between the two, aimed at advancing faltering nuclear talks and officially ending the Korean War. 
Hundreds of North Koreans wearing suits and traditional dresses also greeted Moon, carrying flowers and waving Korean peninsula and North Korean flags. A sign behind them read: ""We ardently welcome President Moon Jae-in's visit to Pyongyang!"" 
The inter-Korean summit will be a litmus test for another meeting Kim has recently proposed to U.S. President Donald Trump, giving clues to whether Kim is serious about denuclearization, a commitment he made at their first encounter in June. 
Trump has asked Moon to be ""chief negotiator"" between himself and Kim, according to Moon's aides, after Trump canceled a trip to Pyongyang by his secretary of state last month.
Washington wants to see concrete action toward denuclearization by North Korea before agreeing to a key goal of Pyongyang - declaring an end to the 1950-53 Korean War. 
""If North Korea-U.S. dialogue is restarted after this visit, it would have much significance in itself,"" Moon said before his departure.
Underscoring the challenges ahead, North Korea's official Rodong Sinmun said on Tuesday ""the responsibility falls squarely on the United States"" for the stalled nuclear discussions.
""It is due to its nonsensical, irrational stubbornness that other issues can only be discussed after our country has completely verifiably, irreversibly dismantled our nuclear capabilities... without showing the intention to build trust including declaring the end of war,"" the newspaper said in an editorial.
Moon, himself the offspring of a family displaced by the war, arrived at the North's capital of Pyongyang at about 10 a.m. (0300 GMT), greeted by Kim, his wife Ri Sol Ju and other top North Korean officials, before inspecting a large honor guard and a military band. 
Moon and Kim were all smiles as they hugged and chatted with each other. 
Kim Yo Jong, the younger sister of the leader and a key propaganda official, was seen preparing officials for Moon's arrival and accompanying Kim Jong Un and his wife. 
The two leaders will sit down for formal talks after lunch, which will be followed by a musical performance and welcome dinner, a South Korean official said.
Accompanying corporate executives, including Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee and the chiefs of SK Group and LG Group, will meet with North Korean Deputy Prime Minister Ri Ryong Nam in charge of economic affairs. 
On Wednesday, Moon and Kim are expected to unveil a joint statement, and a separate military pact designed to defuse tensions and prevent armed clashes.
Moon will return home early Thursday. 
SANCTIONS PRESSURE
This week's summit comes as the United States presses other countries to strictly observe U.N. sanctions aimed at choking off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, amid growing evidence that North Korea is continuing nuclear weapons development. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley accused Russia on Monday of ""cheating"" on U.N. sanctions on North Korea.
Moon is hoping to engineer a proposal that combines a concrete framework for the North's denuclearization and a joint declaration ending the Korean War, Seoul officials said.
The war ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, leaving U.S.-led U.N. forces including South Korea technically still at war with the North.
But U.S. officials remain ""unenthusiastic"" about declaring an end to the war without any substantial action toward denuclearization from the North, Seoul officials said. 
South Korea is pinning high hopes on Kim's remarks to Moon's special envoys earlier this month that he wants to achieve denuclearization within Trump's first term in office ending in early 2021, the first time line he has given.
Agreeing on a timetable is a core task for Moon, as it would induce U.S. action, said Lee Jung-chul, a professor at Soongsil University in Seoul.

""Given U.S. scepticism that South Korea may have oversold Kim's willingness to denuclearize, how President Moon delivers his sincerity toward denuclearization to Trump would be a key factor for the fate of their second summit,"" Lee told a forum on Monday in Seoul.

Turkish celebrity chef Nusret Gokce, who owns a chain of restaurants and is known as Salt Bae for his theatrical style of sprinkling salt on his steaks, posted videos and photos on his Instagram and Twitter pages showing Maduro and his wife, Cilia, dining.
In one video, Maduro tells fellow diners, ""This is a once in a lifetime moment,"" as Gokce dramatically slices steak for them by their table while swaying his hips. In another video, Maduro smokes a cigar taken from a box with a plaque of his name.
Maduro confirmed the visit in a state broadcast later on Monday. Gokce did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Venezuela's political opposition jumped on the meal as evidence of Maduro's disconnect from the country's crisis, which has caused over 2 million people to emigrate to escape widespread shortages of food and medicine.
Almost two-thirds of Venezuelans surveyed in a university study published in February said they had lost on average 11 kilograms (24 lbs) in body weight last year. Eighty-seven percent were assessed to live in poverty.
""While Venezuelans suffer and die of hunger, Nicolas Maduro and Cilia enjoy one of the priciest restaurants in the world, all with money stolen from the Venezuelan people,"" tweeted opposition leader Julio Borges, the former head of Congress.
On social media, Venezuelans shared mocked-up images showing Gokce doing his trade-mark salt sprinkle pose above a skeletal child.
Maduro said he visited the restaurant for lunch during a two-hour stop in Istanbul.
""Nusret attended to us personally. We were chatting, having a good time with him. ... He loves Venezuela, he told me several times,"" Maduro said.
Maduro had traveled to Beijing in hope of securing fresh funds for his cash-starved socialist government, though he returned only having signed several deals involving Venezuela's energy sector.
Gokce went viral in 2017 after posting videos of himself salting meat with a cobra-like maneuver. He has over 15 million Instagram followers and has helped launch Nusr-Et restaurants, which charge several hundred dollars for some cuts of meat, in the Middle East, New York and Miami.

During the more than seven-year conflict in neighboring Syria, Israel has grown deeply alarmed by the expanding clout of its arch enemy Iran - a key ally of Assad.
Israel's air force has struck scores of targets it describes as Iranian deployments or arms transfers to Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah movement in the war.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - ""Quick, move!"" Bangkok street vendors call to each other as they rush carts laden with souvenirs and snacks from the city's bustling Ramkamhaeng road, pushing their wares into an alley before the police spot them.
Once the backbone of Bangkok's renowned roadside economy, thousands of licensed street vendors have spent much of the past two years being shifted to locations they deem less favorable, by authorities bent on improving hygiene and imposing order.
Thailand's street stalls are usually a magnet for tourists in a country where tourism is a major source of income, and which has welcomed record numbers of travelers in recent years.
The military junta, however, has been keen to improve standards of living, particularly ahead of a general election penciled in for early next year - the first since it assumed power in 2014.
""The pavement is the pavement. It is not a place to sell things,"" said Wanlop Suwandee, the Bangkok governor's chief adviser. ""We are doing this in earnest, to return the pavement to the people.""
The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) has moved 20,000 street vendors from 478 locations since 2016. It told Reuters it has identified 205 more locations to address, and that in recent weeks it has increased the rate of clearance. Vendors who return to cleared areas risk being fined.
But some relocated street vendors said much-reduced foot traffic at their new pitches is threatening their livelihoods.
In response, 1,200 members of the Network of Thai Vendors for Sustainable Development marched to the prime minister's office on Sept. 4 and submitted a letter demanding a halt to evictions and calling on officials to find a solution together.
""They can clean up the streets but please don't get rid of us entirely,"" said Lewan Choptha, 54, a souvenir stall owner and one of group's leaders.
CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE
Street vendors play a crucial role in Thailand's economy and are a source of affordable food, experts say. Professor Narumol Nirathron of Thammasat University surveyed 200 people last year and found 87 percent bought items from street vendors.
""It doesn't just affect the vendors. It affects the customer as well - low income earners, for example, or those who have to travel a long way to work in Bangkok,"" said Chidchanok Samantrakul from Women In Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO) and co-author of a report on street vendors.
They are also of cultural significance. The government of nearby Singapore long ago moved street sellers to hawker centres, and last month proposed their inclusion in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
Having come to regard sales on a public thoroughfare as a nuisance, Bangkok authorities are similarly moving street sellers to alternative locations such as indoor markets.
""This is nothing to do with the election,"" Wanlop said. ""People have complained they can't travel safely on the pavement ... sometimes they have to walk on the road.""
However, some street vendors said business conditions at new locations are so dire that they were prepared to risk fines of as much as 300 baht ($9.19) to go back to their former pitches. 

""It was a narrow market on the second floor of building. It was impossible to sell anything,"" said a seafood seller who opted to return. ""Before, I had enough to pay for school, water and electricity. Now we have to rely on loan sharks who charge us 20 percent interest.""

May is under pressure from both euroskeptics and pro-Europeans in her party and the European Commission to deviate from her negotiating stance - known as the Chequers plan - as she tries to secure an agreement on how to separate from the EU.
The government is pursuing a strategy that would sign British businesses up to a common rule book, to keep trade flowing across borders. The alternative, May has said, is that Britain will leave without a deal on March 29 next year.
Many, including the International Monetary Fund, have argued that such a 'no-deal' outcome would badly damage the world's fifth largest economy.
On Tuesday, the Brexit committee published a report highlighting that time was running out to secure a deal before an October/November deadline and that significant obstacles needed to be overcome to reach a deal. 
""If the Chequers plan is not acceptable as a basis for that, then the Government will need to find a different approach urgently,"" committee chairman Hilary Benn said. 
Benn said two alternatives to the current strategy were a customs union and alignment on relevant EU rules, or membership of the European Economic Area coupled with a customs union. Neither approach is consistent with current government policy.

The committee, which scrutinizes and advises on policy but has no legislative power, was split over the impact that a no-deal Brexit would have, but agreed by a narrow majority that it would be ""chaotic and damaging"".

1031,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 06:21PM ET</span>",Peru opposition slams high-stakes vote over president's proposals,"LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian opposition lawmakers on Monday criticized as unconstitutional a call by President Martin Vizcarra to hold a vote of confidence over his proposed anti-graft reforms, a high-stakes move that could force out the Cabinet and Congress.
Late on Sunday, centrist Vizcarra declared four anti-graft bills he has proposed a matter of confidence in his Cabinet, summoning a debate in Congress on Wednesday.
If the opposition-controlled Congress delivers a vote of no confidence, Vizcarra would have to replace his entire Cabinet. But because the current Congress has already dismissed one Cabinet in this government, the constitution allows him to respond by dissolving Congress and calling new legislative elections.
The escalation in tensions between Congress and the presidency is ushering in a new period of uncertainty in Peru, the world's second-biggest copper producer that has a stable economy but has suffered a rocky year of political instability.
Vizcarra's move was condemned by Popular Force, the conservative party with a majority in Congress. 
""It has errors and interpretations with unconstitutional undertones in both form and content,"" Congresswoman Ursula Letona, a spokeswoman for Popular Force, said at a news conference, without giving specifics.
Popular Force lawmaker Daniel Salaverry, the president of Congress, said that Vizcarra's call for a vote of confidence did not comply with ""some characteristics in the constitutional framework.""
Osias Ramirez, another Popular Force lawmaker, accused Vizcarra of trying to stage a coup d'etat against the legislative branch.
Vizcarra denied the move was authoritarian.
""On the contrary, a motion of confidence is done with strict adherence to the constitution and that strengthens the democracy,"" Vizcarra told journalists on the sidelines of an event on Monday.
The procedure could be vulnerable to different legal interpretations. Under Peru's constitution, which was passed in 1993 by former authoritarian president Alberto Fujimori, no president has yet summoned a vote of confidence with the potential closure of Congress on the line.
Vizcarra proposed the anti-graft measures, which include new rules for selecting judges and prosecutors and stricter campaign financing laws, in late July following an influence-peddling scandal involving judges, lawmakers and businessmen.
Salaverry said the reforms, which would require modifying the constitution, should not be rushed.
The fresh political tensions come six months after former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned in a graft scandal on the eve of near-certain impeachment by Congress.

It was unclear when the vote of confidence might be held. Salaverry said lawmakers would let Vizcarra's prime minister make his case on Wednesday but would start debate another day.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's former president Cristina Fernandez was indicted on Monday on charges that her administration accepted bribes from construction companies in exchange for public works contracts, according to an indictment released by a federal judge.
Argentina's Justice Department is seeking to determine whether Fernandez headed a broad corruption network that involved politicians and businessmen during her two terms as president from 2007-15.
The corruption scandal erupted in August when a local newspaper published notebooks kept by a chauffer of Fernandez's former planning minister. The notebooks cataloged bags of cash allegedly delivered to government offices and the private residence of Fernandez and her late husband and former President Nestor Kirchner.
A spokesperson for Fernandez did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
As a senator, Fernandez enjoys immunity from arrest, although she is not immune from prosecution.
Federal judge Claudio Bonadio, who is heading the investigation, asked that Fernandez be impeached, a move that is unlikely to garner the support necessary to pass a Senate vote.
""It is necessary to continue this investigation until we have completely clarified how these illegal payments were structured, at least in regards to the officials who were part of the former planning ministry and the entrepreneurs associated with them,"" the indictment said.
The scandal has implicated dozens of former officials and business owners in the construction sector, shaking confidence in an industry already burdened by an ailing economy, government cuts to public works and crippling interest rates at 60 percent.

Although Fernandez has already been indicted on other charges, she still enjoys broad popular support, and is widely expected to run for president again next year.

Adoboli, who was born in Ghana but has lived in Britain since he was 12, has been granted a review by the interior ministry, meaning he will likely be allowed to go back to his home in Scotland for several months.
""Common sense has broken out: sending a 38-year-old man to a country where he has not lived since the age of four was always madness,"" his spokesman said in an emailed statement
""It is anticipated that Kweku will be allowed home to his Scottish family and partner, Alice within the next 5-10 days. The full review process is likely to take several months.""
Adoboli, who does not have British citizenship, has been appealing against a 2014 order by British authorities that he should be sent back to Ghana as a foreign criminal.
He was released from prison on probation in 2015 after serving half of a seven-year sentence, but was then detained pending deportation.
He was convicted in 2012 over the huge losses to UBS, Britain's biggest ever fraud, caused by trades far in excess of his authorized risk limits, which he had pretended to hedge by booking bogus off-setting trades.

Regulators banned him from working in the financial services industry in 2015, while UBS was fined 29.7 million pounds ($38 million) for systems and control failures.

May told a United Jewish Israel Appeal dinner she was ""sickened"" by the idea that some Jews questioned whether Britain was a safe place to raise their children. 
Labour has been angrily divided this year over pockets of anti-Semitism which Corbyn himself has acknowledged. Critics suggest he should step down for failing to tackle the issue.
A poll in Britain's Jewish Chronicle earlier this month said that 40 percent of Jews would consider emigrating if Corbyn won power in a national election.
In August Britain's former chief rabbi Jonathan Sacks called Corbyn an anti-Semite and said comments about Zionists made by him in 2013, before he was Labour's leader, were the most offensive by a senior UK politician in half a century.
Corbyn said five years ago that British Zionists ""don't understand English irony"" despite ""having lived in this country for a very long time"".
""If we are to stand up for the values that we share - then one of the things we need to do is give young Jewish people the confidence to be proud of their identity – as British, Jewish and Zionist too,"" May said.
""There is no contradiction between these identities - and we must never let anyone try to suggest that there should be.""
Corbyn, a veteran campaigner for Palestinian rights who has moved Labour to the left, has pledged to eradicate anti-Semitism. This month Labour adopted an internationally accepted definition of anti-Semitism in hopes of ending the row. 
Last month, Corbyn said in his 2013 comments he had been describing some pro-Israel activists as Zionists, an explanation which failed to calm the furor.
May said in her speech on Monday ""nothing excuses anti-Semitism – not comedy, not satire, not even irony"".
May said she was committed to strong economic ties between Britain and Israel.
""You can also count on my commitment to Israel’s security, she said. ""I am clear that we will always support Israel’s right to defend itself.""

Current opinion polls show Labour roughly level with May's Conservatives.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Authorities in western Mexico swamped by mounting murders from the country's drug war have resorted to storing dozens of corpses in a refrigerated container truck that in recent days has been parked in several towns, angering residents. 
The semi-trailer truck was noticed last week in a warehouse of a suburb on the outskirts of Mexico's second largest city Guadalajara, drawing the ire of the mayor of the borough, who said it was illegally parked. It then turned up, apparently abandoned, next to houses in a field further from the city, where neighbors complained it was emitting a powerful stench. 
Following complaints, by Monday authorities had moved it to a warehouse near Jalisco state prosecutor's office in Guadalajara, an official at the office said, declining to provide his name as he was not authorized to speak about the matter. The official said about 150 bodies were stored in the truck's container. 
Like other parts of Mexico, Jalisco is suffering from a crime wave that led to a record 31,000 homicides in 2017. The state is home to one of Mexico's most violent and powerful drug gangs, Jalisco New Generation Cartel.
The surging numbers of deaths has overwhelmed Jalisco's morgue and work is underway on a new facility that would hold 700 bodies in its first phase, the state's general secretary Roberto Lopez told local media.
""When it is built, these bodies will be transferred,"" Lopez said. He added that the new facility will be completed in a month and a half.
On Monday, Lopez acknowledged that the use of the truck showed a lack of respect and promised to launch an investigation.
The government ""will not tolerate displays of indifference or laziness,"" Lopez wrote on his Twitter account. 
The identity of the bodies was not immediately clear and how they died, although Lopez was reported in Mexican media as saying they were unidentified victims of organized crime. 
The container was at a warehouse in the Guadalajara suburb of Duraznera for an unspecified amount of time until mayor Maria Elena Limon demanded it be taken away. She said on Twitter it had been removed on Saturday. 
A local Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group made up of truck drivers called ""The Owners of the Road"" said on Saturday that the container had then been placed in a large field, but neighbors demanded that it be moved. Images in Mexican newspapers showed it parked near houses. 
""This affects our kids, it smells horrible and the longer it stays it's going to stink even worse,"" said Patricia Jimenez, a resident of the small town of Tlajomulco, describing the truck as a health hazard.
Mexican media reported that the mobile morgue held 157 bodies, but an official count had not yet been announced by officials.

The explanatory video - published on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) by the German embassy in Brasilia - says that Germans ""don't hide from their past,"" adding that ""from a young age they're taught to confront the horrors of the holocaust.""
The video's assertion that Nazism was a right-wing movement has enraged some in Brazil, who argued the party of Adolf Hitler espoused a left-wing political ideology due to its official name, the National Socialist German Workers' Party.
In the comments section of the video, which has amassed 776,000 views on the embassy's Facebook page, commenters also doubted the veracity of the holocaust, which resulted in the killing of around 6 million Jews, labeling it a ""holofraud.""
""The Holocaust is a historical fact, with proof and testimony that can be found in many parts of Europe,"" the embassy wrote on its Facebook page in response to one holocaust denier. 
The extreme reactions to the video have revealed the deep ideological faultlines in the country ahead of the Oct. 7 first-round presidential vote, which has been overshadowed by violent political attacks, concerns over fake news and an increasingly polarized public discourse. 
Poll-leader Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right nationalist who is recovering in hospital from a near-fatal stab wound, has been called a Nazi by critics, while the vice presidential pick of the second-placed candidate is herself a member of the country's Communist Party. Finally, the country's most popular politician, former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is in jail on corruption charges and barred from running. 
The German embassy in Brasilia did not respond to a request for comment.
Brazil has a long history of German migration that dates back to the 19th century. Many Nazis fled to southern Brazil and other South American countries after World War II, including Josef Mengele of Auschwitz notoriety.

Bolsonaro broadcasted an address from his hospital bed on Sunday, attacking his likely opponents in an Oct. 28 run-off and raising the baseless prospect of voter fraud by casting doubt on the country's electronic voting system.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Burundi, beset by accusations of crimes against humanity, threatened on Monday to withdraw from the U.N. Human Rights Council and sue its critics. 
A U.N. Commission of Inquiry, set up in 2016, published a detailed 272-page report that said the government and its supporters were responsible for crimes against humanity.
The Central African state has refused to cooperate with the three commissioners and last week declared them to be personae non gratae.
Burundian Ambassador Renovat Tabu told the Council that the report was ""full of lies"" and ""politically motivated"" and said it had ""no regard for states, peoples and leaders"". 
“We must... have a culture of truth rather than letting ourselves be poisoned, indoctrinated, and intoxicated by the culture of lies which only destroys the morality of the world,” Tabu said. 
“Burundi reserves the possibility of bringing to justice any person who engages in defamation, even a member of the Commission.” 
The three commissioners rejected Burundi's complaints, saying they were immune from legal action over any alleged defamation and Burundi's withdrawal from the Council would achieve little, without shielding it from scrutiny.
On Friday, Willy Nyamitwe, an adviser to President Pierre Nkurunziza, said Burundi's human rights and justice ministers were in Geneva to meet U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet. 
If Burundi was not treated better, it reserved the right to pull out of the U.N. Human Rights Council, Nyamitwe said.
The three commissioners welcomed the meeting between Bachelet and the Burundian ministers, hoping it could be a sign of a new willingness by Bujumbura to cooperate with the United Nations. 
Nyamitwe blamed the accusations in the report on Belgium, the former colonial power in Burundi, and the European Union, which he said wanted to destabilize the country. He also accused neighboring Rwanda of arming and recruiting Burundian refugees to try to overthrow the government in 2015.
He said the report had ignored serious crimes committed by 34 people wanted in Burundi for involvement in the 2015 insurrection. Some were now activists based in Europe.
“I have seen some of them here (at the Human Rights Council),"" Nyamitwe said. ""We have seen them walking around the (U.N.) Palais des Nations.""
Nyamitwe also defended Burundi's decision to eject three U.N. experts who were supposed to be helping the government with human rights. Nyamitwe said they had arrived in the country without announcing their role.
“That was like an act of war, as if they were spies,” he told reporters.

(Reuters) - Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, was sued for defamation on Monday for falsely suggesting that a British caver who helped rescue 12 boys and their soccer coach from a Thailand cave in July was a pedophile and child rapist.
Vernon Unsworth, who lives north of London, sued over Musk's July 15 tweet to more than 22 million followers referring to him as a ""pedo guy,"" a comment for which Musk later apologized.
He also claimed that Musk falsely called him a child rapist and sex trafficker in an Aug. 30 email to BuzzFeed News.
Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Musk and the company.
Unsworth is seeking at least $75,000 of compensatory damages plus unspecified punitive damages in his complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.
The Hertfordshire County resident said he also plans to file a second lawsuit with the High Court of London for reputational damage suffered in the United Kingdom.
""Elon Musk falsely accused Vernon Unsworth of being guilty of heinous crimes,"" L. Lin Wood, a lawyer for Unsworth, said in a statement. ""Musk's influence and wealth cannot convert his lies into truth or protect him from accountability.""
The case adds to a slew of litigation against Musk, including over his running of Palo Alto, California-based Tesla.
Musk stunned investors last month with tweets saying he had ""secured"" funding to take his electric car company private in a buyout valued at $72 billion, before backing off.
The billionaire's behavior has raised concerns about his corporate leadership, and several Wall Street analysts and some investors have urged Tesla to appoint a strong second-in-command. Musk has admitted to severe stress from running Tesla.
'SORRY, PEDO GUY""
Unsworth said he has been exploring caves since 1971, when he was 16, and now shares a house in the Thailand countryside near Chiang Rai with a 40-year-old woman who owns a nail salon.
He said he became a target for Musk after cavers rejected Musk's offer of a mini-submarine created by his rocket company SpaceX to rescue the soccer team which was freed from the cave on July 10 after an 18-day ordeal.
Though Unsworth told CNN three days later that Musk's offer was a ""PR stunt"" that had no chance of working and that Musk could ""stick his submarine where it hurts,"" he said that did not justify Musk's use of Twitter and the media to defame him.
The July 15 tweet by Musk touted the mini-submarine and then, referring to Unsworth with a shorthand description of pedophile, said, ""Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it."" 
Three days later, Musk defended his mini-submarine proposal, but said he had ""spoken in anger"" toward Unsworth, and that ""his actions against me do not justify my actions against him,"" and that ""the fault is mine and mine alone."" 
But Unsworth said Musk urged in his Aug. 30 email that the BuzzFeed reporter ""stop defending child rapists,"" and called him as ""an old, single white guy From England"" who moved to Chiang Rai, ""renowned for child sex-trafficking,"" to take a 12-year-old bride.
Unsworth said he is not a pedophile, child rapist, child sex trafficker, husband of a 12-year-old bride, or liar, and that the defamatory statements ""were manufactured out of whole cloth by Musk"" because of the disagreement over the mini-submarine.
""On the surface, it appears that Mr. Unsworth can assert the elements of defamation,"" said Nancy Costello, director of the First Amendment Clinic at the Michigan State University College of Law, in an interview.
""Being called a pedophile can be defamation per se, meaning the claim could obviously damage his reputation,"" she added.

The case is Unsworth v Musk, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 18-08048.

CAUCAGUA, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuela's school year began on Monday with few students arriving in classrooms amid a crippling economic crisis that has left many families unable to afford supplies or provide their children with enough food to focus on schoolwork. 
The OPEC nation is collapsing under low oil prices and an unraveling socialist economic system, leaving millions struggling to eat and hundreds of thousands streaming into neighboring countries in search of better conditions.
Though classes often take several weeks to get into full swing, teachers said the absenteeism was significantly more notable this year.
In the poor, rural town of Caucagua about 75 kilometers (47 miles) from Caracas, only three students had arrived at the Miguel Acevedo Educational Unit, a public elementary school that has 65 students registered, according to principal Nereida Veliz.
School performance ""is quite low because children are not coming to class"" said Veliz in the small schoolhouse where the power is out and running water only works three days a week. Students generally come to receive state-sponsored meals.
""They do not eat at home, they eat here,"" she said.
The Education Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Education Minister Aristobulo Isturiz on Friday said classes would start this week for 7.6 million students at 30,000 schools around the country, a figure that includes 5,000 private schools.
Venezuela's hyperinflationary collapse has left pencils, books, and uniforms out of the reach of the average citizen. 
A steady decay of public transportation has become a growing limitation on activities ranging from delivering products to taking children to school.
""I made a huge effort to bring my son to school. Part of his uniform is from last year and from his brother's things,"" said Omaira Bracho, 50, in the coastal city of Punto Fijo in the state of Falcon. ""I found shoes on sale. The hardest thing is the school supplies.""
President Nicolas Maduro says the country is victim of an ""economic war"" led by U.S-backed political adversaries.
In the border state of Tachira, Javier Tarazona of the state teachers' association said classes had not started due to problems including lack of power, inadequate sanitation, and insufficient food.
At the Benedicto Marmol school in Punto Fijo, only three of 365 students showed up on Monday, according to Falcon state teachers' union representative Mari Garcia.

""There are always a lot of children missing at the beginning of the class, but it has never been so noticeable,"" she said.

Governor Mike Sonko on Monday ordered an investigation into the matter and suspended senior staff, his office said.
It was not immediately clear what had killed the babies at the Pumwani Maternity Hospital or what had happened to their mothers.
But the incident reflected declining public health care in Kenya, with patients often complaining about neglect and a lack of drugs in hospitals. 
Government health workers have staged several strikes over low pay and critics say deaths resulting from negligence are common. But such a high number of deaths of babies over a short period of time at the same hospital is rare.

Critics say Trudeau, who now enjoys a majority of just 12 seats in the House of Commons, has mishandled talks on NAFTA - the trade agreement with the United States and Mexico currently being renegotiated - put up obstacles to major energy projects, and is running up too much debt. The next election is set for October 2019.
""This is something that is allowed for in our system, obviously. I wish her well in her decision,"" Trudeau told reporters shortly after the announcement.

The defection was the first from the Liberal ranks since Trudeau took power after an October 2015 election, when Alleslev overturned a large Conservative majority in her parliamentary constituency to win by around 1,100 votes.

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 02:34PM ET</span>",Why Idlib matters and the obstacles Assad faces there,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian conflict has turned toward the northwestern Idlib region, where government preparations for a Russian-backed offensive have sparked a concerted Turkish diplomatic bid to prevent an attack.
A major assault in Idlib, home to some three million people, could be more deadly and destructive than any other in a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people since 2011. The U.N. is warning of a humanitarian catastrophe.
It could also prove the most challenging campaign yet for Assad: Turkey has forces on the ground in Idlib, where the rebels are heavily armed and include highly motivated jihadists. 
WHO CONTROLS IDLIB?
Idlib is held by an array of rebels. The most powerful is Tahrir al-Sham, an amalgamation of Islamist groups dominated by the former Nusra Front - an al Qaeda affiliate until 2016.
There are other Islamists and groups fighting under the Free Syrian Army banner. With Turkish backing, they are now gathered under ""the National Front for Liberation"".
Idlib is also the last major haven for foreign jihadists who came to wage war against the Alawite-led Assad government. 
Estimates of the number of insurgents varies.
The U.N. Syria envoy has said there are thought to be around 10,000 Nusra fighters. Rebel sources say the overall number of rebels reaches many tens of thousands. 
WHY DOES IT MATTER TO ASSAD AND RUSSIA?
Assad wants to recover ""every inch"" of Syria and is already militarily on top. Finishing off the Idlib rebels would take him closer to victory, help secure Aleppo from attack and open roads to the coast and Damascus.
For Russia, which has been fighting in support of Assad since 2015, foreign fighters in Idlib are a big concern.
President Vladimir Putin has said at least 9,000 people from the former Soviet Union have gone to Syria to fight for Islamic State or other extremist groups. Capturing Idlib would secure Russia's airbase in Latakia province from rebel drone attacks. 
WHY DOES IT MATTER TO THE OPPOSITION?
Together with adjoining territory north of Aleppo, Idlib forms the last opposition foothold in Syria.
Rebels and anti-Assad civilian activists have poured into the region under surrender agreements that have granted them safe passage out of former insurgent areas. Outside the northwest, Assad's opponents have nowhere to go but exile.
Half the three million people in Idlib were displaced from other parts of Syria. The U.N. has described it as a “dumping ground” for people from elsewhere in the country. 
WHAT MAKES IDLIB SO COMPLICATED?
Turkey's objections: it already hosts 3.5 million Syrian refugees and wants to prevent another influx. 
Turkey, with NATO's second largest army, has recently reinforced 12 military posts set up in Idlib under an agreement with Russia and Iran. Damascus has seldom encountered hostile foreign armies in the war.
Rebels say Turkey has recently boosted arms supplies to insurgents in Idlib. By contrast, Assad's foreign foes did nothing to obstruct his recent campaign to recover the southwest near Jordan and Israel.
The sheer number of rebels and size of Idlib are also seen as spelling a costly campaign for Damascus. The insurgents are thought to possess anti-armor and anti-aircraft missiles, diplomats say.
And unlike many of the other areas won back by Assad, the northwest has not been weakened by years of government siege.
WHAT IS IRAN'S VIEW?
Iran has said it shares the U.N. concern about a potential humanitarian catastrophe and is seeking to avert it.
Western diplomats say Russia and Iran, which has supplied manpower vital to Assad, may not be entirely on the same page. 
""The Iranians are saying they don’t want to go quickly on this, which is going against the Russian message. So we’re seeing some differences, which until now we hadn’t seen as they were pretty tight together,"" said a European diplomat.
""It’s significant especially as the regime is dying to go forward, but we’ll see how long this offensive is on hold for."" 
The diplomats caution that it is unclear if Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, which has run Tehran's war effort in Syria, shares the view of other parts of the Iranian government.
WHAT IS THE WESTERN VIEW?
While Western governments do not directly back the Idlib rebels, they oppose a government offensive.
The United States has said there is evidence government forces are preparing chemical weapons ahead of an attack.
The White House has warned that the United States and its allies would respond ""swiftly and vigorously"" if government forces used such arms in Idlib.
Damascus denies possessing or using chemical weapons.
Britain's U.N. ambassador has said Syrian generals would be ""held accountable by the international community"" for a major offensive that caused mass civilian casualties.
Idlib's status as a haven for al Qaeda-linked militants has also been of concern to the United States, which has previously mounted drone strikes in the Idlib area.
COULD TURKEY AND RUSSIA STRIKE A DEAL?
Erdogan has called for an international counterterrorism operation in Idlib, in which rebels deemed moderate by Ankara would take part. Russia has called militants there a ""festering abscess"" that must be liquidated. 
Any arrangement that left part or all of Idlib under Turkish control would be anathema to Assad. ""I do not see a practical solution. The Syrian side is very impatient,"" a diplomat said. 
IF ASSAD TAKES IDLIB, IS THE WAR OVER?
No. Lots of territory would remain beyond his grip. Outside Idlib, rebels would still be able to find sanctuary north of Aleppo. Anti-Assad groups also have a base in an area on the Iraqi border, operating alongside the U.S.-led coalition.

A large chunk of northern and eastern Syria remains outside his control. This territory, rich in oil, water and farmland, is held by Kurdish-dominated fighters supported by U.S. forces. While the Kurds are not hostile to Assad, they want a large degree of autonomy, which he opposes.

Officials said the casualties occurred in different incidents late on Sunday night as insurgents kept up attacks on security checkpoints in vulnerable districts.
Mohibullah Mohib, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said Taliban fighters attacked security forces in Pusht-e Rod district, in the west of the province, killing five police.
However a member of the local provincial council, Fareed Bakhtawar, said 10 police were killed in Pusht-e Rod, while another seven soldiers were killed in the district of Bala Boluk, where the insurgents have tightened their grip this year.
The government no longer releases combined casualty totals but there has been a nearly constant stream of similar fighting that has chipped away at the strength of Afghan security forces, often stationed on vulnerable checkpoints.
Farah province, a remote desert area of smuggling routes and uncontrolled borders, has seen constant fighting this year and in May, the insurgents even briefly overran the provincial capital before being driven back with the aid of U.S. forces.

Bolsonaro, who is in the hospital and unable to campaign, has 28.2 percent of voter support, according to the survey by pollster MDA. 
Haddad, who replaced imprisoned former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on the ticket last week, had 17.6 percent in his first showing in an MDA poll.
Haddad's numbers indicated that Lula, banned from running due to a corruption conviction, was successfully transferring his support to the former Sao Paulo mayor, who is well placed to face off with Bolsonaro in the second round in late October.
Center-left populist Ciro Gomes had 10.8 percent of voter intentions and business-friendly candidate Geraldo Alckmin was fourth with 6.1 percent, while environmentalist Marina Silva trailed with 4.1 percent.
In a runoff, which would be triggered if no candidate wins half of the valid votes, Bolsonaro would defeat all other candidates except for Gomes, with whom he is statistically tied, MDA said.
One in four voters are still undecided or say they will annul or leave their ballot blank in Brazil's most uncertain election in a generation.
Other polls published last week showed Bolsonaro losing a runoff against most other candidates.

The nationwide MDA survey of 2,002 people was carried out for the transportation sector lobby CNT between Sept. 12 and 15 and had a margin of error of 2.2 percentage points, meaning results could vary that much either way.

The appeal from Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) came days after the governor of the region where the Moria camp is based said it should be closed next month unless authorities clean up ""uncontrollable amounts of waste"".
MSF said it had witnessed an unprecedented health crisis in the camp, Greece's biggest and home to some 9,000 migrants, a third of whom are children. It said many teenagers had attempted to commit suicide or were harming themselves on a weekly basis.
Other children suffer from elective mutism, panic attacks and anxiety, it said in a statement.
""This is the third year that MSF has been calling on the Greek authorities and the EU to take responsibility for their collective failures,"" the agency said.
""It is time to immediately evacuate the most vulnerable to safe accommodation in other European countries.""
The migrants in the camp, which is on the island of Lesbos, are housed in shipping containers and flimsy tents in conditions widely criticized as falling short of basic standards.
Greece is a gateway into the European Union for hundreds of thousands of refugees who have arrived since 2015 from Syria and other war-ravaged countries in the Middle East and from Africa.
Athens, which exited the biggest bailout in economic history in August, is struggling to handle the thousands of refugees who are stranded on its islands. 
It has criticized Europe's handling of the refugee crisis and some EU member states for being reluctant to share their burden.

Last week, 19 non-governmental organizations urged Greece to take action to alleviate the plight of refugees in all its island camps, not just Moria, to render them more fit for human habitation. The total number of migrants and refugees holed up in the island camps exceeds 17,000.

The projected cost had already been raised by 500 million euros last year.
A ministry spokesman said the extra cybersecurity measures and the onshore training center were being announced now to try to forestall surprises once the ships were under construction.
The cost increase was first reported by the Handelsblatt newspaper.
The ships are to enter service in the mid-2020s, and will be capable of attacking targets on land and underwater and giving aerial protection to other vessels. The program is part of a drive to beef up the navy after years of spending cuts.
The ministry is currently evaluating two bids and expects to ask the bidders for best and final offers late this year or early next, the spokesman said.
The cost estimate covers the cost of four ships. The ministry plans to buy two more, but they are not yet included in the projected cost.
Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) Marine Systems and German Naval Yards Kiel (GNYK) have teamed up to make a bid, competing with a consortium of Dutch shipbuilder Damen and Luerssen-owned Blohm+Voss.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley accused Russia on Monday of ""cheating"" on U.N. sanctions on North Korea and said Washington has ""evidence of consistent and wide-ranging Russian violations.""
The showdown between the United States and Russia over North Korea publicly showed cracks in the unity of the 15-member U.N. Security Council, which has unanimously boosted sanctions since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Haley told the U.N. Security Council that Russia was helping North Korea illegally obtain fuel through transfers at sea, had refused to expel a North Korean who the council blacklisted last year and had pushed for changes to an independent U.N. report on sanctions violations to cover up breaches by Russians.
Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Moscow had not pressured the authors of the U.N. report and blamed Haley for heightening tensions. He also pointed out that the report had determined that a specific ship-to-ship transfer of fuel by a Russian ship, cited by Haley, was not a violation.
Haley said Washington has tracked some 148 cases this year of oil tankers delivering fuel to North Korea obtained through ship-to-ship transfers at sea in breach of a U.N. cap. She did not say how many transfers may have received Russian help. 
""Russia must cease its violations of North Korea sanctions. It must end its concerted effort to cover up evidence of sanctions violations,"" she said. ""Its violations are not one-offs. They are systematic.""
Russia and China have suggested the Security Council discuss easing sanctions after U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met in June and Kim pledged to work toward denuclearization.
Haley said that while ""difficult, sensitive talks"" between the United States and North Korea are ongoing, it was the wrong time to start easing sanctions on Pyongyang.
""It is impossible to come to an agreement if you offer nothing in return for your demands,"" said Nebenzia, suggesting that a confidence-building measure could be for North and South Korea to sign a peace treaty. 
Chinese U.N. Ambassador Ma Zhaoxu said Beijing implements sanctions on North Korea and warned that confronting Pyongyang would be a ""dead end."" He called for progress in negotiations and urged the Security Council to remain united on the issue.
""Resorting to force will bring nothing but disastrous consequences,"" Ma told the council. 

U.N. political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo told the council that while there had been some recent positive developments, ""there continue to be signs the DPRK (North Korea)is maintaining and developing its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.""

Venezuelan soldiers on Thursday crossed to an island in the Orinoco River that has been part of Colombia since 1931, Bogota's foreign ministry said in a statement. It also conducted an investigation to verify that the incident took place, the ministry said.
""There was a violation of national territory,"" it said. ""In the name of the Colombian government the Ministry of Foreign Relations has sent a letter of protest complaining of the repetition of these kind of actions, which violate national sovereignty, and the arbitrary detention of three Colombian citizens.""
The Venezuelan government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Colombia is a top destination for Venezuelans fleeing food and medicine shortages amidst their country's deep economic crisis.
Unauthorized crossings by Venezuelan military personnel along the neighboring countries' porous border occur fairly regularly. 
Colombia last month said soldiers and helicopters from Venezuela's Bolivarian National Guard had entered the country without permission, in a ""violation to Colombia's sovereignty.""

KOCHI, India (Reuters) - An Indian Catholic bishop accused of raping a nun has written to the Vatican asking to step down as protests grow in India's Kerala state for him to be arrested.
""Bishop Franco Mulakkal wrote a letter to Holy Father Pope Francis expressing his desire to step aside temporarily and requested to be relieved from the administration of the Diocese,"" the Diocese of Jalandhar, which he heads, said in a release issued over the weekend.
Kerala police have called Mulakkal for a new round of questioning on Wednesday in the southern Indian state. The bishop has denied wrongdoing.
The nun had accused the bishop of raping her repeatedly over two years from May 2014. She had sent a detailed letter to Pope Francis last week demanding action against the bishop.
The Vatican had no comment on the situation in India.
The case comes at a time when the Christian community, which accounts for 19 percent of the state's population, is reeling under an erosion of trust as sexual abuse cases involving the clergy pile up.
A group of Catholic nuns launched a rare street protest more than a week ago in Kochi, the state's financial hub, demanding justice for the nun. The protest has gathered momentum with Christian bodies, activists, writers and locals joining in.
The group spearheading the protest in Kochi will stage more such protests in various other districts on Tuesday, said Father Augustine Vattoli, coordinator of the Save Our Sisters Action Council.
""We have started the protests demanding the arrest of the bishop. We will not end it without him submitting himself to the law,"" Vattoli told Reuters, expressing doubts over whether the bishop's offer to step aside was voluntary or at the direction of the Vatican.

The Vatican does not disclose when bishops offer their resignation but only when resignations are accepted by the pope and become official.

Since around 1 million asylum seekers reached Germany in 2015, Merkel's government has been pushing for ways to speed up the process of sending home those whose applications are denied.
The issue drew particular attention in relation to North Africa when Anis Amri, a Tunisian, killed 12 people in a Berlin Christmas market attack in December 2016. Amri's deportation had been delayed because he had no valid passport, a source of frustration for German officials dealing with the Tunisian, Algerian and Moroccan embassies.
""We talked about how to make more efficient that those who have no right to stay will be returned,"" Merkel said during her one-day visit when asked about the deportations of Algerians.
She gave no further details.
Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said his government was willing to solve as soon as possible the cases of Algerians eligible for deportation, provided their identities are established. German authorities say nearly 3,700 Algerians are eligible for deportation.
""Algeria takes back its children,"" he said, adding that new digital technology would make identification easier.
German media reported that the number of Algerian failed asylum applicants deported from Germany has risen to 504 in 2017 from 57 in 2015.

Germany wants to declare Algeria, like Tunisia and Morocco, a safe country of origin, which would make it easier to deport asylum seekers from there. Less than 2 percent of Algerian asylum applicants in Germany receive protect status.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration has delayed until next month plans to send a message to all U.S. cellphones testing a previously unused presidential alert system that aims to warn the public about national emergencies, officials said on Monday.
The test message was originally scheduled for 2:18 p.m. EDT (1818 GMT)on Thursday but is being pushed back to the same time on Oct. 3 because of response efforts to Tropical Depression Florence, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said in a statement.
Florence came ashore in North Carolina on Friday as a hurricane and has caused widespread flooding in North and South Carolina.
FEMA, which will send the alert, said last week that the messages would bear the headline “Presidential Alert,” and that phones will make a loud tone and have a special vibration.
The test has been scheduled to ensure that the alert system would work in the event of a national emergency, and U.S. cellphone users will not be able to opt out. The message will read: “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.”
Former President Barack Obama signed a law in 2016 requiring FEMA to create a system allowing the president to send cellphone alerts regarding public safety emergencies.
The country's wireless emergency alert system was started in 2012 and has issued over 36,000 alerts for situations such as missing children, extreme weather and natural disasters, but never a presidential directive.
Cellphone users can opt out of natural disaster or missing children alerts.

In its statement last week on the test messages, FEMA said the presidential alerts can be used only for national emergencies and the president has sole responsibility for determining when such alerts are used.

Greenland is strategically important for the U.S. military and its ballistic missile early warning system, as the shortest route from Europe to North America goes via the Arctic island.
The U.S. intends to ""pursue potential strategic investments vigorously, including investments that may serve dual military and civilian purposes"", the DoD said in a statement published by the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen.
Greenland picked Denmark as its partner in a planned upgrade of two airports last week, seeking to defuse a diplomatic row over how the projects, of strategic interest to both Washington and Beijing, should be financed. 
Greenland is a self-ruling part of the Kingdom of Denmark and while its government decides on most domestic matters, foreign and security policy is handled by Copenhagen.
Denmark has been concerned that a Chinese investment - on the agenda since Greenland's Prime Minister Kim Kielsen visited Beijing last year - could upset its close ally the U.S.
The DoD said in Monday's statement that it intends to analyze and, where appropriate, strategically invest in projects related to the airport infrastructure in Greenland. 
The one-page ""Statement of Intent"" did not go into financial details.
""We welcome the American Statement of Intent, and look forward to discuss details of possible U.S. airport investments in Greenland,"" Greenland's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Vivian Motzfeldt, said in a statement.

GHENT, Belgium (Reuters) - A Belgian court ruled on Monday against an extradition request from Spain for a rapper sentenced to prison for charges including insulting the monarchy, a spokesman for the public prosecutor in the city of Ghent said.
The 24-year-old rapper, known as Valtonyc, and whose real name is Josep Miquel Arenas, fled to Belgium in May after being sentenced in Spain to three and a half years for also praising terror groups.
""For the moment he is free and he is free definitively in Belgium,"" his lawyer Paul Bekaert told Reuters TV in Ghent.
Bekaert added though that a European warrant could be issued for his arrest in other countries that he might visit in the future. 
Valtonyc's case has sparked criticism from international organizations, such as Amnesty International, that claim Spanish authorities are cracking down on free speech.
""I am very happy as finally we have found justice. We have been looking for it for a long time, and in Spain we did not get it,"" Valtonyc said to Reuters TV.
""So it's good that here they ruled in our favor, that here freedom of expression is important, but I'm very sad that in Spain justice is not evolving,"" he said.
Spanish sentences are based on article 578 of the Spanish penal code.
Since 2015 with the approval of a new legislation on security, popularly known as ""gag law"", the number of people charged has risen exponentially, leading to 84 convictions in the last three years, according to Amnesty.
In 2017, 39 people were brought before courts on charges of praising terrorism on social networks.
Spain's new Socialist government has publicly said that one of its priorities is the revision of the ""gag law"".

The airport is a centerpiece of a 15-year construction boom under President Tayyip Erdogan. It has an initial planned capacity of 90 million passengers a year, making it one of the world's biggest airports and a pillar of Turkey's lucrative tourism industry.
Workers have long complained about food, housing and work safety conditions at the construction site, which unions have likened to a concentration camp. 
In February, Turkey's labor ministry said 27 workers had died at the airport since the start of work in 2015, mainly from accidents or health problems. Protests started on Friday after a shuttle bus accident injured 17 workers.
""The reason the majority of our friends have resumed work is not because their requests were met by the company,"" said Ali Oztutan, president of IYI-SEN Union. 
Oztutan said there was a heavy security presence at the airport, which is due to open next month, and that workers were pressured to resume work with threats to not pay them, lay them off or detain them.
Ozgur Karabulut, general manager of Dev Yapi-Is Union, said it was not clear whether the protests would continue.
""The housing area is full of police and gendarmerie, they won't even let the workers breathe,"" he said, adding that 162 workers were still detained.
Istanbul Governor Vasip Sahin said on Sunday that 401 workers had been detained for taking part in the protests.
Airport operator IGA said on Sunday that work at the airport was on schedule and the planned Oct. 29 opening would not be delayed. Steps had been taken to improve working conditions and living quarters, which workers say were infested with bedbugs, it said. 
Veli Agbaba, parliamentarian from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), said authorities did not allow him and others within 10 km (6 miles) of the construction site on Monday.
""There is nothing that cannot be solved in the requests of the third airport workers,"" he said, calling on the labor ministry to investigate the claims of poor work safety conditions.

VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - Hundreds of Russian Communist Party supporters took to the central square of Vladivostok on Monday to protest against what they said was the brazen rigging of a regional election in favor of a politician backed by President Vladimir Putin.
With just under 99 percent of votes counted on Sunday night, Kremlin-backed incumbent Andrei Tarasenko was trailing his Communist rival by over 2 percentage points. 
But on Monday, the election commission said Tarasenko had won by just over 1 percentage point, with results showing he had received almost every one of the almost 20,000 final votes counted, an unlikely turnaround that the Communists called evidence of rigging.
Galina, a 44-year-old state employee, said she was not a supporter of the Communists, but had gone to vote for the first time in 10 years -- for their candidate Andrei Ishchenko -- because she wanted change.
""What's the point of voting if everything has already been decided for us?"" she said, declining to give her surname. 
Gennady Zyuganov, the veteran leader of the Communist Party, called the situation ""criminal lawlessness"" and said planned nationwide protests by his party on Saturday would make the rigged election one of their central issues. 
""... They stopped the vote count for four hours and started stuffing the ballot boxes using special bandit methods,"" Zyuganov told a news briefing in Moscow, calling the imbroglio ""a political Chernobyl"". 
The scandal is awkward for Putin whose own ratings are under pressure from plans to raise the pension age. 
Putin met Tarasenko, who is formally an independent but is widely seen as the ruling United Russia's candidate, a week ago, ahead of Sunday's second round, and told him that ""everything will be OK"", according to a Kremlin transcript of the meeting.
The comment was widely seen as a personal endorsement of Tarasenko, whom Putin appointed acting governor last year.
Ella Pamfilova, head of the central election commission, told Ekho Moskvy radio her officials were analyzing the vote and that she would send a special commission to investigate.
Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters the Kremlin was watching the situation and would be guided by Pamfilova.
Tarasenko failed to pass the 50-percent threshold for an outright win in the first round in the Primorsky Region, which includes the Pacific port of Vladivostok, 6,400 km (4,000 miles) east of Moscow.
That, and three other reversals in elections to select regional governors, amounted to the worst showing for Kremlin-backed candidates since 2012. Though there is no immediate threat to the United Russia party's grip on power, it suggests growing discontent over living standards.
PROTEST CALL
Ishchenko told a crowd of hundreds of people in central Vladivostok on Monday that the vote count had been rigged, and urged supporters to protest every evening until the result was overturned.
""At least 30,000 votes were stolen from us,"" he told the crowd, saying the results had been rewritten overnight.
""We shouldn't stand for it. We have gathered here today to show the authorities that we are the power here, that we decide what happens."" 
Ishchenko had earlier said he would go on hunger strike until the result was annulled. 
The crowd, some of whom were waving red Communist Party flags with the hammer and sickle, booed United Russia and shouted for Tarasenko to resign.
United Russia accused the Communists of buying votes during the campaign, something the Communists deny. 
Standing outside local government headquarters on Monday to protest, Viktoria, a 29-year-old businesswoman who voted for Ishchenko, said she had started celebrating his win the previous night, then woken up to a result she had not expected.

""After this vote, I feel like a nobody. Like I don't count, someone who doesn't have the right to vote,"" she said.

""This person may have been present at or close to the crime scene around the time the crime was committed and may have information about the crime,"" the prosecutor overseeing the case told a news conference.
He declined to answer questions on whether that person was a suspect or just a witness.
Kuciak, who had written about political corruption in Slovakia, was found shot dead along with his fiancee Martina Kusnirova at their home outside Bratislava in February. They were both 27.
The murder - which police have called a professional hit - raised fears over media freedom in ex-communist Eastern Europe, and led to mass protests across the nation that forced the departure of previous police chief Tibor Gaspar as well as Prime Minister Robert Fico and interior minister Robert Kalinak.
The cabinet was reshuffled with Fico's deputy Peter Pellegrini taking over as prime minister but the three-party center-left coalition stayed in power.
The prosecutor, who declined to give his name, said authorities had also whittled down possible motives to two.
He held up a sketch of the possible witness depicting a white man with a beard and dark hair who appeared to be in his late 20s to early 30s. He provided no other details.
""Despite initial mistakes in investigation, we have narrowed down possible motives from 30 to two,"" the prosecutor said. ""I believe we will be successful in the end.""
The update on Monday came after more than 300 Slovak journalists and publishers last month criticized police for the lack of progress in the murder investigation and alleged corruption described by Kuciak. 
""As no fundamental changes to the police or to the prosecutorial bodies have taken place, we have doubts about the independence of the investigation,"" they said in a statement.
Kuciak had covered Slovak businessmen mentioned in the Panama Papers and also probed fraud cases involving businessmen with Slovak political ties. He had also been looking into suspected mafia links of Italians with businesses in Slovakia.

Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis and Slovakia's Peter Pellegrini were commenting on proposals by the European Commission including an enhancement of Frontex to strengthen the bloc's external borders.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel backed the plans last week.
But the former Communist states of eastern Europe have bristled at EU immigration policy which they regard as too lax toward immigrants and overbearing toward member states.
""Malta, Italy, Greece, Spain need to be told that they will get more money. They each have their own coast guard, they don't need any Frontex,"" Babis said in a televised press conference after a joint session with the Slovak government.
Pellegrini agreed: ""It is not right to have an Italian coast guard and, parallel to that, to build some small army under the Frontex label,"" he said.
This year, sea arrivals stand at some 70,000 people, a fraction of the mass influx in 2015 that overwhelmed EU states and stretched services, precipitating a rise in the bloc's populist, nationalist and anti-immigration parties.

1066,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 10:51AM ET</span>",At least 23 die in weekend of Ethiopia ethnic violence,"By Aaron Maasho
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - At least 23 people were killed in a weekend of violence targeting minorities in Ethiopia's ethnic Oromo heartland near the capital Addis Ababa, police said, a blow to new reformist Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's efforts at reconciliation.
The violence escalated on Saturday, the day of a rally marking the return to Ethiopia of leaders of the exiled Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), which had waged a four-decade insurgency for self-determination for Ethiopia's largest ethnic group.
Abiy, himself the first Oromo leader in the ethnically diverse country's modern history, has pursued a reconciliation strategy since taking power in April, steering the state away from a hardline security policy in place for decades.
In the latest unrest, local residents said shops were looted and people attacked by mobs of Oromo youth who stormed through streets targeting businesses and homes of ethnic minorities. The violence escalated on Saturday after two days of sporadic attacks in the Oromiya region's Burayu district northwest of Addis Ababa.
""Mobs of ethnic Oromo youth then marched here in Ashwa Meda and attacked our homes and looted businesses chanting 'leave our land',"" said Hassan Ibrahim, a trader in an ethnically diverse part of the district told Reuters.
""By night time, there were several dead bodies along roads.""
Another resident said some of the violence was carried out by people returning from Saturday's rally in support of the returning OLF leaders. Reuters could not immediately confirm this. The OLF did not immediately comment on the unrest.
State-affiliated Fana Broadcasting said police had detained 300-400 people over the violence. The outlet had earlier on Monday said 200 people had been arrested. 
Alemayehu Ejigu, head of Oromiya region's police commission, denied accusations that police were slow to respond.
Those behind the violence ""do not represent anyone - they had no reason other than theft,"" he said. ""Anyone has the constitutional right to reside in Oromiya or anywhere.""
MARGINALIZATION
Ethiopia's Oromo, who make up about a third of the population, have long complained of being marginalized during decades of authoritarian rule by governments led by politicians from other smaller ethnic groups. In recent years the Oromo have been angered by what they see as encroachment on their land.
Abiy's predecessor Hailemariam Desalegn resigned in February in the wake of violent anti-government protests that had swept the Oromo heartland for two years.
Since taking power, Abiy has lifted a state of emergency, freed political prisoners and removed leaders of banned groups including the OLF from a blacklist, paving the way for their return to the country.
But Abiy's reforms have yet to halt ethnic violence. Clashes between Oromos and ethnic Gedeos in the south caused nearly a million people to flee their homes soon after he took power.
Abiy's chief of staff Fitsum Arega said on Twitter that the prime minister ""strongly condemns the killings and acts of violence against innocent citizens around Ashwa Meda, Kataa and Fili Doro last night.
""These cowardly attacks represent a grave concern to our unity and solidarity of our people and will be met with appropriate response,"" he said.
Hundreds of people staged protests on Monday outside parliament, the central square, the headquarters of state television and other places in the capital demanding justice.
""Our homes were destroyed and our women raped simply because we belonged to another ethnic group. Yet the government is yet to respond properly,"" said Atnafu Worku, one of the demonstrators.

1067,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 10:32AM ET</span>","Turkey's Erdogan calls for investigation into opposition role at Isbank, Hurriyet says","By Can Sezer and Daren Butler
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said authorities should look into members of the opposition who serve on the board of Isbank, Hurriyet newspaper said on Monday, knocking the shares of the country's largest listed lender. 
Erdogan and his aides have previously called for greater scrutiny of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) over its 28 percent stake in Isbank, bequeathed to the party by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, founder of the Turkish Republic.
While the CHP does not receive dividends from the stake - those go to cultural associations, as stipulated by Ataturk's will - party members do have seats on the bank's board.
""It owns 28 percent of Isbank shares. It can't get money from there but it has four board members. What do these four members do? This must be looked into,"" Hurriyet quoted Erdogan as telling reporters on his plane returning from Azerbaijan.
Isbank shares tumbled 5.8 percent to 3.9 lira by 1254 GMT, underperforming a 0.9 percent decline in Istanbul's benchmark BIST-100 index. The Isbank sell-off weighed on banking stocks as well, with the index of bank shares dropping nearly 3 percent.
Isbank said it was too important to be made a subject of political debate, adding that trust in banks needed to be preserved for the sake of Turkey's economy.
The bank said there had been times when Ataturk's 28.09 percent stake had been represented by the CHP and the Treasury, together or separately.
""This does not have any impact on our bank's activities or the way it does business,"" it said.
Since assuming a more powerful executive presidency in July, Erdogan has tightened his grip on the economy and monetary policy, appointing his son-in-law as finance minister and taking charge of the sovereign wealth fund. Fears about growing authoritarianism and the lack of central bank independence have helped send the lira down 40 percent this year.
NATIONALIZATION
Erdogan wants to see lower interest rates to spur lending and boost economic growth. He has repeatedly called on listed lenders to extend more credit to the real economy.
Economists say the Turkish economy is headed for a hard landing and banks are likely to see a spike in bad debt.
One of Erdogan's aides, Yigit Bulut, called in 2016 for the nationalization of Isbank, after the leader of the CHP referred to the president as a ""tin-pot dictator"". 
Authorities previously seized the assets of Bank Asya, a lender started by followers of U.S.-based Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, a former Erdogan ally whom the government accuses of masterminding a failed military coup in 2016.
On Monday, the head of the CHP, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, said his party did not interfere in Isbank and was holding the shares out of duty to Ataturk's legacy. He speculated that Erdogan wanted to transfer the stake to Turkey's sovereign wealth fund.
""Everyone needs to respect Ataturk's heritage. None of our colleagues who are part of the Isbank board meddle in its banking affairs, they only carry the honor of representing Ataturk's shares,"" he told reporters.
""Does he want to transfer it to the wealth fund? This needs to be looked at.""

The government started the wealth fund in 2016 to develop and increase the value of Turkey's strategic assets, and has since transferred billions of dollars of state assets to it, including stakes in flag carrier Turkish Airlines, major banks and fixed-line operator Turk Telekom.

Robert Kyagulanyi, a Ugandan pop star and lawmaker, and MP Francis Zaake were allegedly tortured after they were arrested last month on suspicion of participating in stoning the motorcade of President Yoweri Museveni.
The government has denied that security staff tortured the two men, saying the injuries visible on their bodies could have been sustained in scuffles as they tried to resist arrest. 
""For EU parliament to pass a resolution asking the courts of Uganda to drop charges is inconceivable...we see this as a premeditated attempt to hijack and subvert our institutions,"" government spokesman Ofwono Opondo told a news conference on Monday. 
The EU is a key source of budget support to Uganda and has helped fund construction of major highways and other infrastructure. 
Museveni's convoy was stoned as he left the northwestern Ugandan town of Arua where he had traveled to campaign for a ruling party candidate participating in a parliamentary by-election. 
Kyagulanyi, Zaake and dozens of their supporters were charged with treason for their roles in the incident. The two MPs are now in the United States and India respectively seeking treatment for their injuries.
The detentions of the MPs and their supporters and reports of their torture sparked days of protest in different parts of Uganda.
""Uganda takes objection to the tacit approval of undisciplined behavior by EU and some of its institutions of some of the politicians in the country,"" Opondo said, adding that the EU was hostile to Uganda because of ""our emerging relations with China"".
Critics of Museveni accuse him of using security forces to suppress opposition to his rule but officials say Museveni, 74, enjoys genuine mass support. 
Parliament, which is tightly controlled by his ruling party, last year voted to remove an age cap on the presidency that would have barred him from seeking re-election in 2021.

""The boy died of a head injury,"" said the source, who asked not be identified, declining to give specifics and stopping short of attributing the death to Israeli gunfire.
On Friday, Ashraf al-Qidra, spokesman for the Health Ministry in Gaza, said the youth, Shadi Abdel-Al, had been shot dead by Israeli troops.
Two other Palestinians were killed during the weekly protest by Israeli live fire, local medics said on Friday.
An Israeli military spokeswoman, asked on Monday about the circumstances of the boy’s death and media reports that he had been killed by a stone thrown during the protest, referred Reuters to comments tweeted by the military’s Arabic-language spokesman.

Bosnia's top court had given lawmakers a June deadline to bring the country's criminal procedure code into line with international standards, a key EU requirement for Western Balkan nations aspiring to join the bloc. 
But politicians from Bosnia's three rival ethnic parties could not agree on changes drafted by the Justice Ministry which included the use of undercover police personnel, communications interception, surveillance and the use of informants.
The EU also considered the amendments proposed by the ministry to be too weak, and warned that Bosnian prosecutors would be deprived of one of the major tools to effectively fight against the most serious crime.
A compromise solution agreed under international pressure allows the duration of investigative processes to be cut to a maximum of one year from up to 10 years previously, and reduces the scope for granting immunity to alleged offenders and witnesses.
A majority of lawmakers in Bosnia's multi-layered parliamentary system have enjoyed immunity from prosecution and analysts in the country, which is mired in corruption, said politicians had resisted major changes to the law in order to keep this privilege. 
Disputes among Bosnia's ethnic leaders have nearly halted the Balkan country's progress toward the EU and NATO. Bosnia formally applied for EU membership in 2016 but the process of joining is expected to take at least a decade.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May told rebels in her divided party that if they torpedoed her Brexit deal then the United Kingdom would leave the EU without any agreement, a scenario the IMF said would make the country much poorer.
The United Kingdom is due to leave the EU on March 29 and yet little is clear. So far, no full exit agreement has been reached and some rebels in May's Conservative Party have threatened to vote down a deal if she clinches one.
The fate of May's government and her Brexit plan is in doubt because it is unclear whether she can command the 320 votes she needs in the House of Commons, the lower house of the British parliament, to approve a deal.
""I think that the alternative to that will be not having a deal,"" May told BBC TV, adding she was confident of getting a good agreement she thought parliament would ultimately approve.
Recent signals from Brussels have buoyed hopes that the United Kingdom and the EU can agree and approve a proper divorce arrangement before it leaves, though the sides are still divided on about one fifth of the detail of a deal.
But many business chiefs and investors fear politics could scupper an agreement, thrusting both the EU and the United Kingdom into a ""no-deal"" Brexit that they say would weaken the West, panic financial markets and block the arteries of trade.
London mayor Sadiq Khan said on Sunday that as Britain now faces a choice between a bad Brexit deal or a damaging ""no-deal"" Brexit, voters should be given another referendum.
DISORDERLY BREXIT?
With May's plans in doubt, many British ministers have outlined the damage that they say a disorderly ""no-deal"" Brexit would do to the world's fifth-largest economy and its reputation as a politically stable haven for investment.
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said failure to get a deal would make the economy shrink. The economy will grow around 1.5 percent this year.
""I very much hope and pray that there will be a deal between the European Union and the UK,"" she told reporters.
Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator on the issue, said in Madrid on Monday that talks between the EU and Britain on Brexit are being conducted in a spirit of ""good cooperation"", 
But the EU, in a note before Barnier briefs ministers from member states on Tuesday, said both sides still have work to do to settle a range of issues, including the Irish border.
""Some parts of the draft withdrawal agreement have already been agreed in principle by the UK and the EU negotiators, although nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,"" the note, seen by Reuters, said. 
""There are still parts of the withdrawal agreement that require further negotiation. One of them is the issue of how to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.""
Supporters of Brexit, who admit there may be some short term instability, say some British ministers and business chiefs are spreading scare stories about the impact of a ""no-deal"" Brexit in an attempt to rally support behind May's plans.
The rival tipped by bookmakers to succeed May, Boris Johnson, attacked May's Brexit plans, known as Chequers after the country house where they were hashed out in July.
""The whole thing is a constitutional abomination, and if Chequers were adopted it would mean that for the first time since 1066 our leaders were deliberately acquiescing in foreign rule,"" Johnson said, referring to the 11th Century invasion which established Norman rule over England.
IRELAND
Johnson, May's former foreign minister, scolded May for her handling of negotiations on the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
But he told reporters on Monday that a technical fix to the Irish border issue reported by The Times newspaper could allow for a proper Brexit deal to be clinched.
EU officials and diplomats insist that nothing has fundamentally changed on the so called backstop plan for the Irish border.
What has changed is a shift away from discussion of checks on goods passing through Northern Ireland's border with Ireland to a discussion of the mechanisms for checking goods traveling between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.
""This is part of the de-dramatizing process, Barnier is being creative in offering concessions in the text that seem to go the British way but in fact don’t change the reality,"" one EU diplomat said.
No new border plan will materialize before the Conservative Party conference on Sept. 30-Oct 3, the diplomat said.

Erdogan was speaking to reporters before the two men met in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi. 
""The statement which we will make after the meeting in Sochi will contain new hope for the region,"" Erdogan said through an interpreter. He gave no indication of what would be in the statement. 
Turkey, which supports Syrian rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad, has been holding talks with his allies Russia and Iran over the fate of Syria's rebel-held Idlib and surrounding districts which Assad has vowed to recapture.
Russia's military support for the Syrian government has helped reverse years of rebel gains.
Ahead of the trip to Russia, Erdogan said Turkey's calls for a ceasefire in Idlib region were bearing fruit after days of relative calm but that more work needed to be done. 

Putin this month publicly rebuffed a proposal from Erdogan for a ceasefire there when the two met along with Iran's president for a three-way summit in Tehran.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Maros Sefcovic, a Slovak currently overseeing EU energy policy, announced on Monday his bid for the presidency of the European Commission, the bloc's top job, vowing to tackle the ""barbed-wire"" mentality he said still divided the continent.
But his criticism of what he called ""simplistic solutions"" to problems such as migration proposed by right-wing populists drew a swift retort from Italy's anti-immigrant interior minister, Matteo Salvini, who complained that Brussels had long ignored Rome's requests for help in taking in asylum seekers.
The current head of the EU's executive Commission, Luxembourg's Jean-Claude Juncker, will step down next year. His successor must be agreed by leaders of the EU member states following elections to the European Parliament next May. 
Their nominee must then be confirmed by EU lawmakers before taking up the reins in November 2019. Earlier this month, German conservative Manfred Weber, an ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, also announced his candidacy for Juncker's job.
""We have to get rid of barbed-wire fences in our minds,"" Sefcovic, a 52-year-old Social Democrat, told a news conference, referring to the Iron Curtain that had divided Europe into east and west during his youth.
The Moscow-educated diplomat, who has worked in Brussels since Slovakia joined the EU in 2004, is seeking the nomination of the EU Parliament's second biggest party, the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats.
Sefcovic, who is a vice-president of the current Commission, said politicians must try harder to understand why more Europeans were responding to far-right messages and do more to overcome divisions between the east, west, north and south of the continent.
""Across Europe we hear about simplistic solutions built on populist, anti-European or xenophobic views,"" Sefcovic said. ""They thrive on divisions and they often play with fire, eager to destroy our European cooperation, our European dream.""
Italy's Salvini, at odds with the Commission on migration policy, was quick to respond on Twitter.
""Now they are interested in us, but for years they have ignored Italy's requests for help to stop the landings of migrants,"" wrote Salvini, whose League party came to power earlier this year on promises to curb the migrant arrivals.
Italy has taken in some 650,000 Mediterranean migrants since 2014, U.N. data shows. While arrivals have since fallen sharply, the issue continues to drive the EU's political agenda. 

Opinion polls suggest far-right parties will gain ground in next year's European Parliament elections, in which French President Emmanuel Macron has cast himself as a standard-bearer for pro-EU, liberal forces.

1077,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Macron's 'tough love' to young jobseeker fuels French reform debate,"By Luke Baker
PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron's quick tongue has repeatedly landed him in trouble since he took office, but he shows no signs of backing away from his straight talk, telling an unemployed man he could easily get a job if he tried.
Despite crumbling poll numbers -- his approval rating has fallen to 31 percent from above 60 percent shortly after he was elected last year, according to Ifop -- Macron seems convinced that ""telling it how it is"" is what the nation needs.
During an open-house at the Elysee Palace over the weekend, the 40-year-old president chatted with members of the public, including a 25-year-old man who said he had a diploma in gardening but was finding it difficult to land a job.
Macron, a former investment banker, asked if he had tried the restaurant or hotel trade, to which the man shook his head.
""If you're keen and motivated, in the hotel trade, cafes, restaurants, the building trade even -- there's nowhere I go that people don't tell me they're looking to hire,"" the president told him, speaking frankly but not unkindly.
""Honestly. Hotels, cafes, restaurants -- if I cross the road I can find you something. They simply want people who are ready to work,"" he persisted, suggesting that the man look around Montparnasse, a touristy district of Paris.
France's 24-hour news channels played video of the exchange in a loop, calling it the latest gaffe from Macron, who has previously referred to people as ""slackers"", berated striking workers for ""kicking up a bloody fuss"" and upbraided a young boy for addressing him too familiarly.
Government members rallied around Macron on Monday, arguing that straight talk is what voters want, rather than the spin and doublespeak -- known as 'langue de bois' in France -- so common in politics.
""If he'd had a conversation with the man and said to him: 'that's terrible, give me your CV, we'll call you'... that would have been total 'langue de bois',"" Budget Minister Gerald Darmanin told RTL radio. 
The finance, education and environment ministers mounted a similar defense, saying Macron's economic reforms -- some of which are already in force while others are to be unveiled soon -- were aimed at retraining the jobless to find work in new areas. 
French unemployment is stuck at around 9 percent, with many people unable to find work in their field while other sectors, such as the hospitality industry, are always short of staff. 
Last week, a union representing hotel, cafe and restaurant employees asked the government to speed up its asylum process to allow migrants to secure work permits more quickly and fill thousands of empty jobs.
Christophe Castaner, the head of Macron's party, who is battling to keep the movement tight amid falling popularity and the resignation of a high profile member at the weekend, said Macron's assessment on finding work was right.
""I prefer a president who tells it straight,"" he said, pointing out that you can't create jobs to match people's training, but you can train people to do jobs the economy needs. 

""Gardening work has fallen in recent years,"" he said, underlining that there was no contempt for the unemployed. ""This young man, we need to help him get the right training.""

1078,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 08:00AM ET</span>","Pakistan auctions cars in austerity drive, PM commutes by helicopter","By Asif Shahzad
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's new government on Monday began auctioning off about 100 government-owned vehicles as part of new Prime Minister Imran Khan's highly publicized cost-cutting drive, which has drawn mixed reviews.
Auction official Mohammad Asif told Reuters the vehicles could bring in about 2 billion rupees ($16 million) to the cash-strapped government's coffers, although that estimate depends on finding buyers for four bullet-proof Mercedes, estimated in value together at 1 billion rupees.
The auction has been billed as part of Khan's drive to give ""the nation's wealth to its rightful owners"", though critics say most of the new government's cost-cutting measures are more symbolism than significant savings. 
Former cricket star Khan, 65, took office last month after a populist election campaign in which he railed against what he denounced as the corruption and waste of the two main political parties that have traded power for more than 50 years in between periods of military rule.
Khan has promised to cut costs, including trimming the motorcades of government officials and selling public land.
""It is a change of mindset,"" Khan said in a speech on Friday.
""I will be counting every single rupee I have to spend on me.""
Khan's austerity vows, however, have been undercut by his near-daily helicopter commute from his home in the hills above Islamabad.
Critics say the cost-cutting has been mostly cosmetic.
""There is nothing new in the current austerity drive,"" said political commentator Raza Rumi. 
Auctions of aging government vehicles, for example, have taken place for years, though not so publicized.
The 36 Mercedes and BMW vehicles was a larger number than at previous auctions - and the sale offered bullet-proof luxury sedans estimated to be worth 250 million rupees (about $2 million) each.
Still, nearly three-quarters of the 101 vehicles on offer were more than 10 years old, some noticeably knocked about. Two were 32-year-old Toyota Corollas.
IDEAS
Even if the auction were to bring in its projected 2 billion rupees, that is a drop in the bucket compared with the government's 5.9 trillion rupee ($48.19 billion) budget, which projects a 1.7 trillion rupees in deficit spending.
Still, Khan's information minister, Fawad Chaudhry, said even symbolic steps were important for building national unity.
Public morale may be important in the coming year as Pakistan could face painful conditions for foreign financing - possibly an International Monetary Fund bailout - to address dwindling foreign currency reserves and a ballooning current account deficit.
Chaudhry argued that small cutbacks can add up.
""If you try to see its effect on the GDP, it is small, but in numbers, it is not small,"" Chaudhry told Reuters. 
Still, public reaction to the austerity drive has been mixed.
When the new foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, announced he would not fly first class, only business class, when traveling abroad, many pointed out that this was already the case under the previous government. 
Other early ideas - including Khan's vow to cut more than 500 staff from Prime Minister House and establishing a six-day work week for civil servants - were shelved as unworkable.
In particular, Khan has been mocked by some for taking a helicopter into Islamabad most days, after publicly declaring he would eschew motorcades and declining to live in the official prime minister's residence.
Information Minister Chaudhry said the helicopter commute used less fuel than a motorcade, at one point arguing that it cost only 50 rupees (40 cents) per kilometer.
That calculation provoked fresh ridicule.
""Why don't you stop metro bus service and instead let people enjoy the cheap helicopter rides?"" quipped a TV host.
In fact, the eight-seat helicopter Khan uses costs about 200,000 rupees ($1,633) per hour factoring in fuel, crew, maintenance and safety inspections, according to Syed Naseem Ahmad, president of the Society of Air Safety Investigation Pakistan.
'TWO CENTS'
Optics aside, analysts say Pakistan will have to take more painful steps - such as raising fuel prices - to make a real dent.
""In a nutshell, there is no indication yet, that Prime Minister Khan has a concrete plan to cut Pakistan's mounting debt and government spending,"" said Yousuf Nazar, former head of Global Emerging Markets Investments,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C). 
An indication of cost-cutting policy is likely to come on Tuesday, when Finance Minister Asad Umar announces revisions to the budget.
In the meantime, some of the about 500 attendees at Monday's auction said they would be happy to take the vehicles off the government's hands.
Nawab Gul bought a 2005 Toyota Altas for 1.25 million rupees ($10,000).
""They are saying the national coffers are empty. So, here, have my two cents,” Gul said.
Another bidder Taufeeq Nawab said he would like to buy one of the older, cheaper vehicles for his family. 
""I can say that I have a Prime Minister House car. My kids will feel good riding in it.""

Pyotr Verzilov, publisher of a Russian online news outlet and affiliated with the anti-Kremlin band Pussy Riot, lost his sight, hearing and ability to walk but is doing better since he arrived in Berlin for treatment on Saturday, two friends said on Sunday.
""We have followed the case, of course, and are concerned about the health of Mr Verzilov,"" a German Foreign Ministry spokeswoman told a regular government news conference. ""We hope he will be better soon and that he will recover fully.""
The Foreign Ministry spokeswoman and another spokeswoman for the Chancellery said their offices were informed that Verzilov was coming to Berlin but were not involved in organizing the trip.
The ministry spokeswoman declined to say whether Verzilov's case was discussed at a meeting on Friday between German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov but she added that human rights are always a topic in such talks.
Verzilov arrived in Berlin from Moscow late on Saturday on a medical transport plane, the managing director of the Berlin-based Cinema for Peace human rights group, Jaka Bizilj, said on Sunday. The group paid for the transport, and Bizilj said that Russia had been ""cooperative"" in the matter.
Verzilov is publisher of Mediazona, a Russian online news outlet which focuses on human rights violations inside Russia's penal system. He staged a brief pitch invasion during the soccer World Cup final in Moscow in July along with three women affiliated with Pussy Riot.
Pussy Riot came to prominence in 2012 when its members were jailed for staging a protest against Russian President Vladimir Putin in a Russian Orthodox cathedral in Moscow. The group has since become a symbol of anti-Kremlin protest action.

SKOPJE (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis accused Russia on Monday of attempting to influence the outcome of a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name that would open the way for it to join NATO and the European Union.
Speaking after talks in Skopje with Macedonia's leaders, Mattis also said the United States was looking to expand cybersecurity cooperation with the small Balkan country.
Macedonians will vote on Sept. 30 on a deal reached in June with neighboring Greece that would change the country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia. Athens insisted on the change in return for lifting its opposition to Skopje joining NATO and the EU. 
""We do not want to see Russia doing there (in Macedonia) what they have tried to do in so many other countries,"" Mattis told reporters traveling with him to Skopje, apparently referring to Washington's concerns about Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and other polls.
""No doubt that they have transferred money and they are also conducting broader influence campaigns,"" Mattis said, adding it was unclear how effective Moscow's efforts had been. 
Russia denies the charges of meddling but strongly opposes Macedonia's plan to join NATO. Its ambassador in Skopje has said the country could become ""a legitimate target"" if relations between Russia and NATO deteriorate further.
In July, Greece expelled two Russian diplomats and barred two other people from entering the country for trying to bribe officials and foment demonstrations to thwart the deal with Macedonia.
Russia denied Athens's allegations and responded in kind by expelling Greek diplomats.
""MALICIOUS CYBER ACTIVITY""
Mattis is the latest in a string of Western leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, to visit Macedonia and urge its citizens to back the name deal.
""... we plan to expand our cybersecurity cooperation to thwart malicious cyber activity that threatens both our democracies,"" Mattis said, with Macedonia's prime minister and defense minister standing next to him. 
Mattis also met Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name deal. 
NATO has invited Macedonia to begin accession talks with the alliance, but says it must first change its constitution and adopt the new name. The EU has also said it would set a date for Macedonian accession talks pending implementation of the deal.
Recent opinion polls suggest a majority of Macedonians will support the name deal, though nationalists oppose it. Several thousand Macedonians rallied on Sunday in Skopje in support of the deal and of NATO and EU membership.
""There is no alternative for the Republic of Macedonia then integration into NATO and EU,"" Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said on Monday, standing beside Mattis. 
Washington is concerned that Russia is sowing disinformation with the aim of suppressing voter turnout in the referendum and creating an impression that the United States is not committed to the region.
""Our approach to disinformation is not to try to counter every single argument... We show by our senior-level visits, our presence, we show by highlighting our cooperative activities,"" Laura Cooper, deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, told reporters before the Mattis trip.
The United States spends nearly $5 million a year in security assistance for Macedonia and since 1991 has provided about $750 million in total assistance. Macedonia has a few dozen troops in Afghanistan as part of the NATO-led mission.
U.S. officials believe Russia accelerated its disinformation campaign in southeast Europe in 2014, the same year it annexed Crimea from Ukraine.
""What is in some ways frustrating and maddening about it is, it is so cheap, what they are doing, and it is so effective,"" said Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the CSIS think tank in Washington.

""This requires sustained American and European engagement, it (southeast Europe) is a pretty fragile place.""

Police forcibly ejected a Chinese man surnamed Zeng and his parents from a hotel in Stockholm in the early hours of Sept. 2 after they arrived a day before their booking and were asked to leave, according to Chinese state media.
China has lodged representations with Sweden about the incident and has asked for an immediate response to the complaint, China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular briefing.
""We again urge Sweden to take China's concerns seriously, and to take practical measures to protect the security and legitimate interests of Chinese tourists,"" he said.
Sweden had not yet responded to China's requests for an update on the investigation, which was not in accord with diplomatic convention, Geng added.
Swedish prosecutor Mats Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) told the Aftonbladet daily that no preliminary investigation had been initiated because ""we made the assessment that no crime on the part of the police had been committed"".
A Swedish government source, who declined to be identified, said Sweden believed that China was exaggerating the incident because Sweden had spoken out over the case of a Swedish citizen detained in China.
""We think it's related to Gui Minhai,"" said the Swedish government source, referring to a Swedish, Hong Kong-based bookseller who has been held by Chinese authorities since 2015 after he was abducted in Thailand.
""Sweden and the EU have repeatedly called for his release and Chinese authorities don’t like that.""
An official newspaper of the ruling Chinese Communist Party, the People's Daily Overseas Edition, earlier accused Sweden of hypocrisy.
""Some Western nations, including Sweden, always praise themselves for their human rights, freedom and equality. But when it comes to China's people and issues, they seem to often show a different face, a different set of standards.""
A video clip of the tourists wailing and crying as they sat on the ground outside the hotel door has drawn mixed reactions from Chinese internet users. 
Some blamed the Swedish police for mistreating the tourists, but many lambasted the travelers, saying their behavior was unseemly and embarrassing.
""I really find these types of people too infuriating. Could they please not make a spectacle of themselves and give the motherland some face?"" said one user wrote on the Weibo social media platform.

President Donald Trump announced in May that Washington was pulling out of the deal, which lifted international sanctions against Tehran in exchange for restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities. Many fear the U.S. withdrawal will lead to the deal's collapse.
""As discerned almost unanimously by the international community, this ominous move is doomed to have serious repercussions for the international and regional peace and security,"" the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi, told an annual U.N. nuclear watchdog meeting.
Salehi, a veteran negotiator with the West, did not elaborate on what those repercussions might be. 
Iranian forces are fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria, where fighters from Iranian-backed Hezbollah are also deployed. The war in Yemen is also largely seen as a proxy war between Iran and U.S. ally Saudi Arabia.
Some U.S. sanctions lifted under the deal have already been put back in place while others are due to resume in November. European powers have scrambled to protect Iranian oil revenues and shield companies from the U.S. measures to keep them operating in Iran, but many firms have pulled out regardless.
The sanctions have contributed to a slide in Iran's currency, the rial, which has lost about two-thirds of its value this year, hitting a record low against the U.S. dollar this month. 

""The international community's opposition to the U.S. withdrawal ... does not nearly reflect the deep anger at the American unilateralism but also the concerns about the extremely difficult situation in our immediate region with all its pervasive chaos and the existing menace of terrorism,"" Salehi said in his speech to the IAEA General Conference.

1084,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>",Trial begins Monday for Chicago officer accused of murdering black teen,"By Suzannah Gonzales
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The trial of white Chicago policeman Jason Van Dyke, accused of murder in the 2014 shooting of a black teen, was scheduled to begin on Monday in a decisive case for race relations and policing in the third-largest U.S. city. 
A soundless dashboard camera video released in 2015 showed police gunning down 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. It spurred protests, fed a national debate over the use of excessive force by police against minorities and led to the ousting of local officials. 
The officer, now 40, opted for a jury trial on Friday following the selection of a 12-person jury and five alternate jurors. 
The jury of four men and eight women includes seven white persons, three Hispanic people, one black person and one Asian person, based on appearances, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Opening statements were expected later on Monday.
Van Dyke, who was suspended without pay after he was first charged in 2015, pleaded not guilty to murder and has said he felt threatened by McDonald.
McDonald was armed with a knife when he was shot. Van Dyke faces six counts of first-degree murder, 16 counts of aggravated battery - the same number of times prosecutors say McDonald was shot - and one count of official misconduct. Van Dyke is the first Chicago police officer to face a murder charge for an on-duty incident in decades.
The deaths of mostly unarmed black men at hands of police officers across the United States in recent years have led to protests and sometimes violence in major U.S. cities. The killings, some of which were captured on video, helped give rise to the Black Lives Matter movement and became an issue in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. 
The video, released by the city more than a year after the shooting in response to a freedom of information lawsuit, sparked days of protests in Chicago. Former Chicago police Superintendent and mayoral hopeful Garry McCarthy was fired, voters ousted the prosecutor who charged Van Dyke, and activists called for the resignation of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.
Emanuel said on Sept. 4 he would not seek a third term after facing widespread criticism over his handling of the city's gun violence, a stain on his national political legacy. He did not specifically cite McDonald in his announcement.
A U.S. Department of Justice investigation that began after the video's release found that Chicago police routinely violated people's civil rights, citing excessive force and racially discriminatory conduct.
Three Chicago Police Department officers were indicted in June 2017 for conspiring to cover up McDonald's shooting. They have not yet been tried.

Illinois state judge Vincent Gaughan will oversee the trial in Cook County circuit court.

State broadcaster TRT Haber said last week the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani had given Erdogan the aircraft, which Turkish media said was a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 747, sparking criticism from Turkey's opposition.
A lawmaker from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), Sezgin Tanrikulu, had expressed concern that the aircraft had been bought rather than donated, noting that Turkey was in an economic crisis, the Hurriyet newspaper reported.
The plane, which would normally carry 400 people, had been refitted to seat just 76, the newspaper said. 
Erdogan said Qatar's emir had donated the plane, which he said was worth around $500 million, to the Turkish state after hearing that Turkey had expressed interest in buying it.
""He said, 'I won't take money from Turkey. I give this as a present to Turkey',"" Erdogan told reporters on a flight back from Azerbaijan at the weekend.
Turkey is grappling with a sharp fall in its currency, double-digit inflation and an expected sharp economic downturn.
Qatar, its main Arab ally, approved a $15 billion package of economic projects, investments and deposits last month, giving a boost to the battered lira.

Erdogan told reporters the plane was being repainted and once it was finished ""we will travel with it. But you will be getting on the plane of the Republic of Turkey, not my plane"".

One man in the state of Western Australia and a girl in South Australia reported finding needles in their strawberries in the past two days, according to police. 
Seven brands of strawberries in Australia are now believed to be contaminated with needles and pins, according to police reports, prompting warnings from authorities to slice the fruit before eating.
Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart told reporters on Monday that it was unclear if the contamination was the result of a single person acting alone or several people acting independently and that tracing back through the complex supply chain was taking time.
Consumers in Queensland were the first to report finding needles embedded inside strawberries.
""A member of the public today presented at York Police Station to report his concerns that a needle had been in a punnet of strawberries,"" the Western Australian police said in a statement. 
""The member of the public advised he located the needle in his sink after preparing strawberries for his family. He did not recall the needle being in the sink prior to preparing the strawberries.""
South Australian police meanwhile said that they were advising members of the public to check punnets of Mal’s Black Label strawberries following a report of a needle found inside the fruit on Sunday morning.
""When the fruit was consumed this morning, a needle was found inside one of the strawberries. There were no reported injuries,"" state police said. Police in both states are investigating.
Both of New Zealand's biggest supermarket chains decided on Monday to halt Australian strawberry orders for now, even though the country's Ministry of Primary Industries confirmed none of the contaminated strawberry brands had made it on to shop shelves. 
Australian police said the contaminated fruit appeared to have originated at a Queensland-based supplier. Queensland is a major strawberry producer in a national industry worth more than A$130 million ($93.22 million) a year.
Woolworths Group has removed all the affected brands from shelves in its supermarkets, but continues to sell other varieties of the fruit.
Jamie Michael, who is head of the Western Australia Strawberry Growers Association, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp that his farm had dumped strawberries in the peak of the season and that if shoppers stayed away, some growers would not be able to afford to plant a crop for next year.

XIAN, China (Reuters) - A top Chinese general attended the opening on Monday of a regional armed forces health forum organized by the Chinese and U.S. militaries, as the two sides set aside friction over trade and territorial issues such as the South China Sea.
This week's Asia Pacific Military Health Exchange in the western city of Xian, best known as the home of the Terracotta Army, has about 600 participants, with military officials from 28 countries, including U.S. allies like Japan and Australia.
General Song Puxuan, head of China's Central Military Commission's Logistics Support Department, posed for pictures with Terry M. Rauch, acting U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense, at the opening ceremony in a Xian hotel.
Song, whose attendance was not announced in advance, did not address the conference. Military sources say he is close to President Xi Jinping and was previously head of the military's northern command, having risen rapidly up the ranks since Xi took office six years ago.
China has been keen to highlight its cooperation with the U.S. military, despite a bitter trade dispute and Chinese suspicion about U.S. support for self-ruled and Chinese-claimed Taiwan, and U.S. involvement in the disputed South China Sea.
""This meeting can help promote the healthy and stable development of the two militaries' ties, and make our contribution towards promoting peace and stability in the Asia Pacific, providing positive energy,"" Song's colleague, Chen Jingyuan, head of health at the Logistics Support Department, told reporters.
Speaking earlier, Chen hailed the exchange as a ""first"" between the Chinese and U.S. militaries on military health for the Asia Pacific.
'IMPORTANT TO BE HERE'
Rear Admiral Louis C. Tripoli, command surgeon of the United States Indo-Pacific Command, thanked the People's Liberation Army for its efforts in arranging the conference.
""We hope that you feel how important it is for us to be here,"" Tripoli said.
He told reporters they had had ""very good talks"".
""I believe that people are being transparent and are being truthful about the problems that we face in the region from a health standpoint and I believe that everyone is here and eager to work together to solve these problems,"" Tripoli said.
China was angered in May when the United States withdrew an invitation to a major U.S.-hosted naval drill, saying that closing the door does not promote mutual trust and cooperation. 
The Rim of the Pacific exercise, known as RIMPAC and previously attended by China, is billed as the world's largest international maritime exercise and held every two years in Hawaii in June and July.
The Pentagon said the withdrawal of the invitation was in response to what it saw as China's militarization of islands in the South China Sea.

Still, China's navy chief Shen Jinlong plans to pay a working visit to the United States later this month, during which he will attend an international naval forum, according to China's Defence Ministry.

Low Taek Jho, who is suspected of having been close to former prime minister Najib Razak, is wanted by Malaysian and U.S. authorities on suspicion of being a key figure in a scandal involving state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
Low used to party with Hollywood stars but now his whereabouts are not known. He has previously denied wrongdoing and did so again in a letter posted on the website.
""Let me be clear: I am innocent,"" Low said in the letter.
""With hindsight I may have done things differently, like any young person, but any mistakes I made do not amount to the sweepingly broad and destructive allegations being made against me.""
Benjamin Haslem, a co-chief executive of a public relations company representing Low, Wells Haslem Mayhew Strategic Public Affairs, said in a statement to Reuters the website - http://www.jho-low.com- was created on behalf of Low ""through his legal counsel, to provide information to the public"".
Malaysian police have issued arrest warrants against Low in connection with the 1MDB scandal. 
The U.S. Department of Justice says more than $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB, with some of the money used to buy a private jet, a superyacht, Picasso paintings, jewelry and real estate.
Former Malaysian premier Najib, who founded 1MDB, has been charged by Malaysian authorities with money laundering, criminal breach of trust and abuse of power. Najib has denied wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty. 
Low said in the letter many allegations against him had originated from blog posts, leaks from governmental agencies around the world or from unproven allegations filed in court, and he had never been given an opportunity to set the record straight.
""I have been paraded in effigy through the streets of Kuala Lumpur, and photographs from my younger days plastered in tabloids across the globe,"" he said.
""This website is an effort to change that,"" he said.

Erdogan was due to hold talks in Russia later on Monday with President Vladimir Putin, whose military support for the Syrian government has helped reverse years of rebel gains and who publicly rebuffed Turkey's ceasefire call 10 days ago.
""The situation in Idlib has been calm for three days. It looks like we obtained a result with the efforts which were made,"" the newspaper quoted Erdogan as telling reporters on a flight back from Azerbaijan at the weekend.
""But we are still not satisfied,"" he said. Turkey, with 3.5 million Syrian refugees, has already borne the ""political and human burden"" of Syria's seven-year-old conflict and any new refugee flow would head for Turkey, Erdogan said.
Turkey, which supports rebels opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has been holding talks with his allies Russia and Iran over the fate of Idlib and surrounding districts which Assad has vowed to recapture.
Ankara has established a dozen military observation posts around Idlib, which it has reinforced with troops and equipment in recent weeks according to Turkish and Syrian rebel sources.
""We are trying to protect the pure, clean, innocent people there with these observation posts,"" Erdogan said. ""But currently everybody can see the regime's mercilessness and the terror which they are spreading there. There is a terror state.""
The Idlib region is home to around 3 million people. Parts of it are held by Turkey-backed rebels but many of the towns are controlled by jihadist fighters such as Tahrir al-Sham, which includes insurgents from the former al Qaeda branch in Syria.
Turkey has called for measures to target hardline militants in Idlib while protecting civilians and avoiding an indiscriminate assault, likely backed by Russian air power, which it says would cause a humanitarian catastrophe.

""Let's all take steps, measures together against the terror groups among the opposition in Idlib,"" Erdogan said. ""But let's not create an excuse and take a step like bombing there.""

The four days of intense fighting in Ghazni have highlighted problems, including resentment of the regular military, that are increasing as the insurgents step up pressure to disrupt parliamentary elections next month.
Dozens of policemen have been killed since the Ghazni fighting as the Taliban have attacked northern cities and districts including Sar-e Pul, Baghlan and Samangan. In Kunduz province, 15 police personnel were killed in one incident last week.
""We fight for our country but we don't get the benefits and respect given to a soldier,"" said Ghazni policeman Mohammad Zaman, reflecting the long-standing resentment that has hampered coordination among security forces.
""We suffered a lot of casualties and many policemen were killed but the government has paid no attention to us. We haven't even been paid yet,"" he said.
Though generally less well paid and equipped than their army colleagues, Afghan police forces have been on the front line of the insurgency for years, sitting in exposed checkpoints where they bear the brunt of the fighting and suffer heavy casualties.
A Pentagon report from March put the actual strength of the Afghan National Police at 129,156 out of a combined security force of 313,728 that was 11 percent below its authorized strength of 352,000.
Under a plan launched last year, the Afghan Border Police and the Afghan National Civil Order Police are being transferred to the ministry of defense in a move intended to free up other police units for more traditional law enforcement.
But progress has been slow. According to the Pentagon report, there had been ""no significant change"" in the role of the police despite the transfer.
An interior ministry report produced after the Taliban briefly over-ran Ghazni last month found that for over 28 hours policemen fought alone before the army launched counter-insurgency operations.
""The Afghan National Police acted swiftly but they were defeated because they are not trained to fight the Taliban. It was found that some policemen were scared and ran away to neighboring villages,"" the report said.
REASSESSMENT
With the Taliban in control of large areas of the countryside and pressing attacks on provincial cities, the role of the police is likely to increase as the insurgents step up attempts to disrupt the October parliamentary elections.
About 50,000 police are currently undergoing training to protect thousands of polling stations, many in remote districts across the country, but the heavy losses have dented morale, said Ahmad Khan, the spokesman for the Ghazni police.
""It is the army's duty to fight against the Taliban and we (police) have our own duty, but we fought to save Ghazni, we are doing what exactly the army does,"" said Khan.
""We want to know why was the Afghan army late when we were being attacked from all sides. We are forced to fight alone and complete other duties.""
Foreign donors, notably the United States, which is expected to allocate $766 million this year for the Afghan National Police, have long pushed for reforms, including improving pay, getting rid of corrupt leaders and weeding out non-existent ""ghost"" police from the rolls.
The experience in Ghazni and the widespread complaints from police have prompted pledges of reform from the government and promises of new weapons and equipment to replace the battered AK-47s and Humvees used by the force.
""Police will not have guard checkpoints, we will post army soldiers on the all crucial check posts in the next 30 days,"" said a senior interior ministry official.
""Their salary will also be increased in the upcoming defense and security budget,"" the official said. 

The plan, however, is yet to be approved by the National Security Adviser Hamdullah Mohib who was given the job last month after his predecessor Hanif Atmar resigned over differences with President Ashraf Ghani following the siege of Ghazni.

PYONGYANG (Reuters) - Sixteen-year-old Ri Jin Ryong, a member of North Korea's paramilitary Worker-Peasant Red Guards militia, says he has one message for South Koreans if the two countries ever reunite.
""I will spread the word about how wonderful it is to be in our dear Marshal Kim Jong Un's arms,"" he told Reuters at Pyongyang's zoo, where he and other soldiers were given a day of recreation after participating in a grueling military parade before the North Korean leader on September 9.
Ahead of this week's summit between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in Pyongyang, North Korea is once again highlighting the idea of reuniting the two countries divided since the 1940s, through state media and major events.
In South Korea, however, the concept of unification has become increasingly convoluted and viewed as unrealistic amid an ever-widening gulf between the two nations.
“North Korea’s rhetoric gravitates around unification not because they really believe in an immediate unification but it’s a powerful slogan that gives justification for them to improve inter-Korean relations,"" said Lim Eul-chul, professor of North Korean studies at Kyungnam University in Seoul.
""To South Koreans, the idea of unification is not as appealing because it immediately reminds them of the burden of unification costs.""
Days before hosting Moon for their third summit of the year, Kim Jong Un said: ""We should tear down this wall of conflict to meet the Korean people’s constant ideals and demands to open a grand path for unification,"" state newspaper Rodong Sinmun reported on Sunday.
""ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS""
International sanctions over North Korea's nuclear weapons restrict many cooperative projects and trade, a major obstacle to warming ties between the two Koreas, let alone reunification. 
But North Korean defectors are much more likely to support the idea than their Southern neighbors, according to past surveys.
More than 95 percent of North Korean defectors who responded said unification is needed, compared to about 53 percent for South Korean respondents, one 2017 survey by the Seoul National University Institute for Peace and Unification Studies showed.
For decades, North Koreans have pushed the concept of ""one country, two systems,"" under which the country would maintain different systems of government in the North and South, at least until the two could be peacefully reconciled.
""We understood that we should acknowledge differences between the North and the South on ideology, religion, faith alike, and cooperate with each other,"" one North Korean who defected to the South in 2013 spoke on condition of anonymity.
""I also remember learning that unification would also help resolve our economic difficulties.""
North Korea's per capita Gross National Income of 1.46 million won ($1,283.52) is only about 4.4 percent that of South Korea, according to estimates by the South's central bank. While projections of the cost of reunification have ranged widely, running as high as $5 trillion, most believe the cost would fall almost entirely on South Korea.
After the first meeting between leaders of the two Koreas in 2000, both sides agreed to consider the idea of ""one country, two systems"", at least as an interim step to unification.
But on its website, the Institute for Unification Education, the education arm of South Korea's Unification Ministry, said the North's idea of a federation consisting of two regional governments with different ideologies and systems ""has little possibility of becoming reality given no historical precedents.""
""North Korea’s rhetoric concentrates on the unification between one people ... but what it really means is that they think unification between the Koreas justifies disregarding international relations and sanctions,"" said Shin Beom-chul, senior fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.
""In a situation where there are U.N. and U.S. sanctions, it’s hard to go along with that rhetoric for the South.”
Sanctions banning almost all trade with the isolated country have hindered even basic bilateral exchanges between the neighbors. South and North Korea opened a liaison office on Friday after weeks of delay, as Seoul sought to address Washington's concerns about a potential breach of sanctions.

""ONE BLOOD""
On the streets of Pyongyang, North Koreans interviewed by Reuters uniformly supported the idea of unification, and just as uniformly, said Kim Jong Un is making it more likely than ever.
""Under the dear leader's superior leadership, I believe the nation’s unification could certainly become reality if the North and the South cooperate from now on,"" said cashier Ri Hae Kyong, 53.
Like all the North Koreans interviewed by Reuters in Pyongyang, Ri was speaking in front of the government minders who accompany media everywhere, making it difficult to truly assess North Korean views on unification.
Cosmetics clerk Yang Su Jong, 27, also said she believes ""it’s not long"" before unification happens, in part because Kim had made North Korea a ""strong nuclear power.""
And North Koreans said they see their Southern neighbors as family.

""North and South are one blood,"" Pyongyang waitress Song Jin A told Reuters. ""As a new generation, we want to live with our compatriots in the South as one, (we) want to all live together cuddled in our leader Kim Jong Un’s arms.""

""We want to dialogue but it must be as equals,"" Diaz-Canel said in the wide-ranging interview with Venezuela-based television station Telesur broadcast on Sunday evening, echoing his predecessor and mentor, Raul Castro.
""We do not accept impositions and we are not willing to make concessions,"" he said.
Cuban-U.S. relations have deteriorated sharply since Trump took office and began partially rolling back the historic detente agreed by his predecessor Barack Obama after decades of hostility.
They have also worsened over what the United States says were a spate of health attacks on its diplomats based in Havana. Cuba denies any involvement.
""Cuba does not attack, Cuba defends, Cuba shares,"" said Diaz-Canel, who referred many times throughout the interview to Fidel Castro, the late leader of the 1959 revolution, and his younger brother, Raul Castro.
Raul Castro, 87, remains head of the Communist Party until 2021 and is ""like a father"" to Diaz-Canel, according to the 58-year-old president who said they talk nearly every day.
Diaz-Canel praised Cuba's long-standing alliance with Venezuela but also said he welcomed the presidential victory of leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in Mexico that was ""encouraging"" for Latin America. 
On the topic of a draft new constitution being debated at community meetings throughout Cuba, Diaz-Canel said the removal of the word ""communism"" did not mean Cuba was renouncing that aspiration.
The document, which should replace a Cold War-era constitution, still refers to socialism, which implies communism, he said.
Diaz-Canel said he supported the proposed change to the constitution to allow for same-sex marriage.

""I defend there being no kind of discrimination,"" he said, although it was up to the Cuban people to decide whether to include the change.

1098,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 17, 2018 12:30AM ET</span>","Hong Kong, southern China clean up after super typhoon","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The financial hub of Hong Kong began clearing up on Monday after being battered by one of the strongest typhoons in recent years, with financial markets and offices operating as normal.
Super typhoon Mangkhut, with hurricane-force winds well over 200 kilometers per hour (124 miles/h), had barreled past the northern tip of the Philippines, killing at least 50 people. It then skirted south of Hong Kong and the neighboring gambling hub of Macau, before making landfall in China.
Parts of Hong Kong and Macau were severely flooded, though there were no immediate reports of fatalities. China Central Television, the state broadcaster, said four people had been killed in Guangdong, China's most populous province of over 100 million residents.
The state broadcaster also said flood warnings had been issued for 38 rivers in the neighboring region of Guangxi, while 12 coastal monitoring stations reported their biggest-ever waves. It also said more than 13,300 hectares of farmland had been damaged.
As many as 2.45 million people in Guangdong province had been relocated on Sunday night, the official Xinhua news agency reported. 
The China Meteorological Administration said the typhoon, dubbed ""King of Storms"", swept west to Guangxi province at 6 a.m. (2200 GMT on Sunday) and weakened to a ""tropical storm"". It forecast the storm to hit the regions of Guizhou, Chongqing and Yunnan on Monday.
The meteorological administration said Mangkhut was one of the 10 biggest storms to hit southeast China since 1949 - when records began - with wind speeds at around 162 km/h.
Across Hong Kong, authorities strived to clear roads of debris, including toppled trees and bamboo scaffolding. Some buildings, including the One Harbourfront office tower, had many windows smashed after a day in which some of the city's skyscrapers had swayed with the ferocious gusts.
""Yesterday's storm was very strong. Even for a person of my weight, I was about to be blown down by the wind which made me very scared,"" said a 70-year-old resident surnamed Fung.
""It was very serious this time.""
Stock and financial markets opened as normal on Monday in Hong Kong and the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.
Some transport services remained suspended, though flights in the region were slowly resuming after a shutdown on Sunday, stranding many thousands of passengers.
In Macau, badly hit by a super typhoon last year, authorities were much more prepared this time, ordering casinos to close late on Saturday night as the storm approached.
Casinos were operational again early on Monday though authorities were still struggling to restore power to some of the 20,000 households that suffered power cuts.
Macau gambling stocks were down in early Monday trade.

The Maritime Self Defense Force submarine Kuroshio conducted a naval exercise on Thursday with other Japanese warships in the South China Sea, including the Kaga helicopter carrier, which is on a two-month tour of Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said.
She said it was the first time a Japanese submarine had conducted drills there, confirming an earlier report in the Asahi newspaper.
The exercise, which involved the submarine trying to evade detection, was conducted away from island bases constructed by China to push its claims in the strategic sea. However, it could still anger Beijing because submarines represent a greater potential menace to shipping than surface vessels.
It came after a British Royal Navy amphibious assault ship, HMS Albion, sailed close to islands claimed by China in the South China Sea late last month to exercise ""freedom of navigation"" rights.
Britain's first such operation prompted a strong protest from China, which sent aircraft and a naval vessel to meet the British ship.
The U.S. Navy has conducted similar operations in the South China Sea. Washington has said it would like to see more countries challenge Beijing in the South China Sea, through which some $3 trillion of shipborne trade passes each year. 
Foreign aircraft and vessels in the region are routinely challenged by Chinese naval ships and monitoring stations on the fortified islands, sources have said previously. Beijing insists its intentions in the South China Sea are peaceful.
Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have territorial claims in the area.
In a separate announcement, the defense ministry said the Kuroshio, with a crew of 80, would make a five-day port visit to Vietnam's strategic naval base at Cam Ranh Bay from Monday.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala's constitutional court on Sunday made a provisional ruling by a unanimous vote to allow the chief of a United Nations-backed anti-graft body to return to the country, a judge told a news conference at the court. 
President Jimmy Morales last month announced the shuttering of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), and subsequently barred its head from returning to the country, a move that triggered global criticism and street protests across the Central American nation.
""The plenary of magistrates annuls the decision taken by President Jimmy Morales, which prevents the return of the head of CICIG,"" said Dina Ochoa, one of five judges on the court. 
The court will allow 48 hours to hear arguments against the ruling before coming to a final decision, a spokesman said. 
Morales early this month ordered CICIG's chief, Ivan Velasquez, to be denied entry back to the country after a visit to the United States, shortly after saying the commission's mandate would end in a year. 
The body brought down his predecessor with a corruption probe and sought to prosecute Morales, a former comedian, over illegal financing allegations.
CICIG said Velasquez is working in New York and following the case.

""We hope, given the order of the Constitutional Court, that he can in short time return to Guatemala,"" CICIG's spokesman Matias Ponce said in a statement.

LONDON (Reuters) - Two people fell ill on Sunday while eating at a restaurant in Salisbury, the English city where former Russian agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned in March, police said.
In a statement, Wiltshire Police said there was nothing to suggest the incident at the Prezzo restaurant involved the nerve agent Novichok, and that it was not clear whether a crime had been committed. Enquiries were continuing, police said.
One of the two people taken ill at the restaurant is Russian, Sky News said, citing sources. Officers were called to Prezzo in the evening in response to a ""medical incident"" involving a man and a woman, Wiltshire Police said, adding that the restaurant and surrounding roads were cordoned off as a precautionary measure. Britain has said Russian officers used Novichok to attack the Skripals. The Kremlin has denied any involvement.  Police have said a nerve toxin had been left on the front door of the Skripals’ home. They were found slumped in Salisbury city center after visiting the Bishop’s Mill pub and Zizzi, another Italian restaurant. The former Russian spy and his daughter survived the murder attempt, but an unconnected woman, Dawn Sturgess, died in July and her partner Charlie Rowley fell ill after Rowley found a perfume bottle containing the same nerve agent. Earlier this month British prosecutors identified two Russians they said were operating under aliases - Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - whom they accused of trying to murder the Skripals with a military-grade nerve agent. Britain charged the two men in absentia with attempted murder, and said the suspects were military intelligence officers almost certainly acting on orders from high up in the Russian state. Two Russians resembling the men said on television on Thursday that they were innocent tourists who had flown to London for fun and visited the city of Salisbury to see its cathedral. They surfaced a day after President Vladimir Putin said Russia had located Petrov and Boshirov, but that there was nothing special or criminal about them.

Mangkhut was blamed for more than 200 million yuan ($29.1 million) of damage in the southern province of Guangdong, state broadcaster China Central Television reported. The storm killed dozens when it earlier hit the Philippines.
The weakened remnants of Mangkhut were north of the city of Nanning, capital of the Chinese province of Guangxi, on Monday morning. In Hong Kong, the storm warning was lowered to Strong Wind Signal No. 3, allowing the city’s stock exchange to open as normal, while Macau’s casinos resumed business from 8 a.m. local time. Fights in and out of the region continue to face disruptions.
""There are still strong winds generally over the territory, while occasional gales are affecting high ground,"" the Hong Kong Observatory said in an advisory on Monday.
Mangkhut had shut Hong Kong all day Sunday after the Observatory gave the storm its highest warning signal. Hong Kong escaped the brunt although media reports showed images of apartment building windows being blown out, trees toppling, scaffolds collapsing and a crane falling off a building at a construction site. Storm surges raised sea levels as much as four meters higher than usual in Victoria Harbour, according to the Observatory.
All schools in Hong Kong are closed on Monday as bus and part of the city’s railway services remain suspended. Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam urged companies to show understanding and adopt a flexible approach to staff who have difficulties getting back to work.
Hong Kong Airport is trying to get business back to normal. More than 1,400 flights had been canceled across the region, according to Flight Aware. Cathay Pacific Airways said it expects a gradual return to scheduled operations, but there will be continued delays and some cancellations. All flights at Guangzhou International Airport are grounded through Monday morning.
In an unwelcome, and potentially costly first for Macau, the gaming regulator had issued an order on Saturday forcing casinos to close their doors.
“This robs the month of one important weekend day,” Grant Govertsen, an analyst at Union Gaming Securities Asia Ltd., said in a note.
While the casinos are able to reopen this morning, it will take a while to get transportation back to normal given the disruption to flight and ferry services.
September’s revenue growth rate could be affected by as much as seven percentage points, almost cutting in half Union Gaming’s previous forecast of a 15 percent increase, Govertsen said. It also may cut third-quarter revenue growth by two points, to 12 percent.
In China, more than 2.45 million people were relocated and more than 48,000 fishing boats returned to ports in Guangdong province as of 5 p.m. Sunday, when Mangkhut made landfall.
The Philippines was worst hit, particularly the mainly agricultural north-west as the death toll topped 50. The government put losses to the nation’s agriculture sector at 4.99 billion pesos ($92 million), almost all of it rice, and 175,301 hectares of farm land.
Francis Tolentino, a senior adviser to President Rodrigo Duterte, estimated 5.7 million people were affected by the storm.

1103,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2018 10:00PM ET</span>","Australian voters like new PM, poll shows, but not enough to save government","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's center-right government remains on track for a heavy defeat at elections due by May 2019, an opinion poll showed on Monday, even though new Prime Minister Scott Morrison posted a strong personal showing after his first three weeks in charge.
The Fairfax-Ipsos poll published on Monday showed Morrison, who replaced Malcolm Turnbull in a party-room coup last month, well ahead of his center-left Labor opponent Bill Shorten as preferred prime minister.
Morrison took over as leader of the Liberal Party, the senior partner in a center-right Liberal-National coalition, to become Australia's sixth leader in less than 10 years.
The Fairfax-Ipsos poll of 1,200 voters showed Morrison leading Shorten by 47 percent to 37 percent as preferred prime minister but that was not likely to be enough to save the government as public anger grows over leadership changes.
The latest poll showed that Labor still leads the coalition by 53 percent to 47 percent on a two-party preferred basis under Australia's complicated preferential voting system, under which votes from minor parties are distributed as they are eliminated according to preference deals.
That six-point gap had at least narrowed from 10 points a month ago, the poll showed, but was still where the main parties stood in June and would not be enough to save the government from a heavy defeat if an election was held immediately.
Morrison outpointed Shorten on seven measures of leadership attributes, from economic influence to vision and trustworthiness, much as Turnbull had done.
However, with the government holding just a one-seat majority, that will count for little if it cannot be translated into party votes.
With that in mind, Morrison has moved to woo older voters with measures that include scrapping plans to raise the pension age to 70 and announcing on Sunday a powerful inquiry into aged-care facilities.
His first real test comes in a month, when a by-election will be held in Turnbull's Sydney constituency that is expected to draw a fierce backlash from voters.
A safe seat for the government until Turnbull quit politics last month after losing the leadership, it is now expected to be a tight race.

A loss there would force Morrison to strike an agreement with independent lawmakers to continue in minority government.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Two Venezuelans firemen who made a viral video portraying President Nicolas Maduro as a donkey were jailed on Sunday pending trial on charges of inciting hate and could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted, right groups said.
Ricardo Prieto, 41, and Carlos Varon, 45, were arrested by military counterintelligence officers on Wednesday at the fire station where they worked in western Merida state, according to the human rights observatory of the University of the Andes in Merida, which is tracking the case.
The pair appeared on Sunday before Judge Carlos Marquez, who ordered they be held for trial on charges of violating a law against fomenting hatred that was passed last year, the observatory and the Penal Forum rights group said.
""The firemen were indicted with an aggravated charge of inciting hate. That aggravated charge indicates ... 20 years of jail time,"" said lawyer Ivan Toro of the observatory, who attended the hearing.
Opponents of the leftist Maduro, who blame him for Venezuela's economic meltdown, have long dubbed him ""Maburro"" in a play on the Spanish word for donkey, ""burro.""
His administration did not respond to a request for comment on the case. Reuters was not immediately able to contact Prieto and Varon or their lawyers.
In the video, one man leads a donkey through a Merida fire station while another talks to the animal as if he is guiding the president on one of his many official visits to schools, hospitals and army bases that are shown on state television.
The men's lawyers said the firemen made the video as a joke and not to incite hate, Toro said, relating Sunday's hearing.
Rights group say that Maduro has led a crackdown on dissent, with Penal Forum estimating there are currently some 234 political prisoners in Venezuela. Maduro says he is confronting an armed insurrection that is designed to unseat his socialist government and usher in a U.S.-controlled puppet regime.

The front-runner for the first round of the election on Oct. 7 appeared weak and struggled at times to speak in a nearly 20-minute talk broadcast live on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Bolsonaro alleged the PT was willing to win through fraud, attacking the party he would likely face in a second-round runoff scheduled to take place on Oct. 28 and casting doubt on the country's electronic voting system.
""In the second round, the major worry is not losing the vote, but losing to fraud,"" he said.
A spokesman for the PT declined to comment.
Brazil's most wide-open election in decades hit further complications when Bolsonaro was stabbed on Sept. 6 in an attack that he says nearly killed him and required two emergency surgeries.
His support has since edged up to 26 percent of voters' intentions in the first round, according to a recent opinion poll. He would lose to all rivals in a runoff, with the exception of PT candidate Fernando Haddad, with whom polls show him in a technical tie.
Last week, the electoral court that oversees the voting system barred former President Luiz Inacio Lula de Silva from running as the PT's presidential candidate because of a corruption conviction, with support for Haddad jumping after taking Lula's place on the top of the ticket.

Bolsonaro said he would likely return home in a week, although he said previously he would not be able to return to campaigning in time for the first round.

Bajwa is the most senior Pakistani figure to visit staunch ally China since the new government of Prime Minister Imran Khan took office in August, and his trip comes a week after China's top diplomat visited Islamabad.
Pakistan has deepened ties with China in recent years as relations with the United States have frayed.
Bajwa may be hoping in Beijing to smooth out any Chinese alarm at comments last week by Pakistan's commerce minister, Abdul Razak Dawood, who suggested suspending for a year projects in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the Pakistan leg of China's Belt and Road Initiative that includes recreating the old Silk Road trading route.
Bajwa, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), regularly holds meetings with world leaders due to the Pakistan armed forces' outsize influence in the nuclear-armed nation, where the military controls security and dictates major foreign policy decisions. 
""During the visit COAS will interact with various Chinese leaders including his counterpart,"" Major General Asif Ghafoor, the military spokesman, tweeted late on Sunday.
Beijing has pledged to invest about $60 billion in Pakistan for infrastructure for the Belt and Road project.
Dawood, in an interview with the Financial Times, also suggested the CPEC contracts had been unfairly negotiated by the previous government and were too favorable to the Chinese. Later he said the comments were taken out of context, but did not dispute their veracity. 
The critical comments were published just after China's top diplomat, State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, visited Pakistan and the two sides reaffirmed the mutual benefits of the Beijing-funded projects.
On Thursday, Pakistan's government said it wanted CPEC to include more projects with a focus on socio-economic development, something which would align more with the populist agenda of Khan's new administration.

Since taking power last year, the party has embarked on a process to overhaul the judiciary and change legislation to decriminalize several graft offences. Several party members, including leader Liviu Dragnea, are under investigation or on trial for corruption. 
Justice Minister Tudorel Toader pushed through the dismissal of chief anti-corruption prosecutor Laura Codruta Kovesi earlier this year and is currently reviewing the country's prosecutor general.
The Social Democrats' legal changes have raised concerns over the rule of law from the European Commission, which is keeping Romania's justice system under special monitoring, the U.S. State Department and thousands of magistrates, while triggering the country's largest street protests in decades.
On Sunday, magistrates stood on the steps of Bucharest's Court of Appeals holding banners which said ""For an independent justice"".
""The independence of judges and prosecutors is not their privilege or a personal prerogative but a necessity to ensure that the judiciary is capable through its institutions to fulfill its purpose,"" Prosecutor General Augustin Lazar said in a statement. 
Judges and prosecutors were protesting changes to the criminal code, supporting the prosecutor general and asking that lawmakers consult the Venice Commission, the Council of Europe's advisory body on constitutional matters.
They have held two similar protests in recent months.
""There is political interference in the justice act, and the changes to criminal procedures and the criminal code depart from international standards,"" one magistrate said.
The Constitutional Court meets on Monday to discuss challenges brought by opposition lawmakers against changes to the criminal code. The Venice Commission is expected to issue an opinion on the changes in mid-October.

Concerns over the rule of law in Romania follow similar issues seen in Poland and Hungary, where governments are under pressure from the EU over democratic standards.

1110,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 16, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",Swiss government calls on Russia to cease spying activities in country,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland has demanded that Russia cease any spying activities on its territory after two suspected espionage cases came to light in recent days.
The Swiss foreign ministry has summoned Russia's ambassador in Bern three times this year to raise concerns about suspected operations targeting organizations based in Switzerland, including a laboratory used to test chemical weapons.
""The Swiss Dept. Of Foreign Affairs has called on Russia to immediately end illegal activities on Swiss soil or against Swiss targets,"" it said in a statement on Sunday.
Switzerland's intelligence agency said on Friday it had worked with British and Dutch counterparts to foil a Russian plot which, according to newspaper reports, was targeting a Swiss laboratory.
Citing unnamed sources, the Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger and the Dutch NRC Handelsblad said the suspected agents were heading for the Spiez laboratory near Bern which analyses chemical and biological weapons and tests nerve agents such as Novichok.
Britain says Moscow used Novichok to try to kill former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the English city of Salisbury in March and has charged two Russian men in absentia with attempted murder. 
The operation resulted in the Netherlands expelling two suspected Russian spies in March.
Meanwhile Swiss prosecutors said they were investigating a cyber attack against the offices of the World Anti-Doping Agency in Switzerland. 
Criminal proceedings were launched in March 2017 on suspicion of political espionage, the attorney general's office said on Saturday.
The individuals concerned were the same pair identified by the Swiss intelligence service on Friday, the office said.
Switzerland may have been targeted because it hosts many international associations like the International Olympic Committee and the United Nations.
The Swiss newspaper Sonntags-Zeitung on Sunday said that according to a Swiss intelligence agency estimate, one in four Russian diplomats in Switzerland are or had worked as intelligence officers.
The Russian embassy described the newspaper's allegations as ""unsubstantiated"" and ""baseless"".
""This seems an absurd attempt to give readers a biased view of the Russians working in Switzerland,"" the Russian embassy said.

The airport, a centerpiece of a 15-year construction boom under Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, is due to open late next month.
Unions say workers at the site have long complained about conditions, including pay, food and living quarters, as well as safety standards. Protests broke out on Friday after a shuttle bus accident injured 17 workers.
Thousands of workers joined the demonstration, which was broken up by police who deployed in riot control vehicles and detained 500 people, one union leader said.
Video footage, which the union said was from the construction site, showed hundreds of men chanting: ""We are workers, we are right, we will have our way one way or another.""
Large labor protests have been rare in Turkey since a state of emergency was imposed following a failed July 2016 coup. It was lifted two months ago after Erdogan's re-election but his opponents say Turkey's new executive presidency retains many of the emergency powers. 
Ozgur Karabulut, general manager of Dev Yapi-Is union, said on Sunday that 160 people had been released and the union estimated 360 remained in detention.
""Some of our friends who were released last night were taken back to the camps but they are not working,"" he told Reuters. ""We expect these protests to go on for a long time.""
A statement issued on Sunday by unions complained of late salary payments, poor food and ""awful"" conditions at the workers' living quarters. The ""airport construction site is no different to concentration camp for workers,"" it said.
The unions said they would continue to fight until working conditions were improved and the detained workers were released and allowed to resume their jobs. 
While the airport is scheduled to open at the end of October, Karabulut said that was in doubt because the remaining work would take another two months.
An official at airport operator IGA played down the protests, saying work continued and the airport would open as planned on Oct. 29. 
""Our workers are working to schedule, there is no disruption at all,"" IGA's corporate communications director Gokhan Sengul said. ""There was a little bit of protests on Friday triggered by provocateurs who came in on Friday like union representatives."" 
Sengul said the company had already started improvements, including disinfecting rooms and laying on extra buses to prevent delays to and from work.

""All this talk about protests is just manipulation... We are due to open on October 29 with no disruption,"" he said.

The crowd, waving Macedonian flags, marched through Skopje city center and stopped in front of the European Union office in Macedonia to hear Prime Minister Zoran Zaev speak. 
""EU and NATO is the safe road, for us there is no other alternative. That's our guide for a better life,"" Zaev told them.
He called on people to vote in support of a ""historic"" decision on Sept. 30, when a referendum on both the membership bids and the agreement with Greece to change the country's name to Republic of North Macedonia will take place. 
Greece, a member of both NATO and the EU, has refused to accept the Balkan country's name, saying it implies territorial claims on the Greek province of Macedonia and amounts to an appropriation of its ancient civilization. It has blocked the country's membership bids.
Macedonia was part of the now-defunct Yugoslavia, declaring independence in 1991. 
Zaev's government, elected in 2017, pushed for an agreement with Greece and the two sides agreed on the new name in June.
In June, NATO invited Macedonia to begin accession talks with the alliance, but said it would have to change its constitution and adopt the new name first. 
The EU has also said it would set a date for Macedonian accession talks pending implementation of the name deal. 
Macedonian nationalists who oppose the deal organized a protest in the eastern town of Stip on Sunday.
""They (the government) are taking advantage of the Macedonian people's strong will to achieve European standards, true prosperity, stability and security, to push an agenda which is against our state and national interests,"" the leader of the opposition VMRO-DPMNE party, Hristijan Mickoski, told about 2,000 people in Stip. 

According to recent opinion polls, more than 50 percent of people are likely to vote, with the majority supporting the membership bids and the name deal.

FREJUS, France (Reuters) - France's far-right leader Marine Le Pen urged Europe's populist parties to unite against a liberal establishment in next year's European elections, as she made a combative return to the spotlight after her bruising election defeat last year.
In a speech on Sunday to supporters of her National Rally party in the southern town of Frejus, Le Pen said her party would campaign for May's European Parliament elections ""in liaison"" with allies in its Europe of Nations and Freedom party.
France's president Emmanuel Macron has pitched the vote as an open battle between anti-immigrant populists like the National Rally and pro-European Union progressives like himself.
""In France, our objective is to beat Macron,"" she said to a chorus of cheers in the southern bastion of far-right support.
""In Europe, it is to build with our allies, the other (nationalist) groups, a majority that makes a break from the decaying European Union and moves toward a cooperation of nations which respect each other's diversity and identity.""
Le Pen wants to force Brussels to hand back powers to nation states, an outcome supporters of the EU say would sound the death knell for Europe's political and monetary union. 
Europe's populists have scored election successes from Italy to Sweden and from Austria to Hungary, yet uniting the eurosceptic parties may prove difficult.
Previous attempts to unite the far right have produced little and Le Pen offered no new answers, reiterating her vision of a Union of European Nations whose member states would cooperate but regain their national sovereignty.
Le Pen has struggled to unite her party and assert her leadership since she was soundly beaten by Macron in last year's presidential run-off vote. 
A poll last week of voter intentions for the May election showed Le Pen's party gaining ground to stand neck-and-neck with Macron's centrist LREM. 
On Sunday she attacked Macron's first 16 months in office, but saved her toughest words for France and Europe's immigration policy and praised Matteo Salvini, Italy's anti-immigrant interior minister.

""With us, France will once again control its borders,"" she said.

The European Parliament voted on Wednesday to sanction Hungary for flouting EU rules on democracy, civil rights and corruption in an unprecedented step that left Orban isolated from some powerful allies in the European Parliament. 
Hungary said it would seek legal ways to challenge the ruling which it described as ""petty revenge"". However, Hungary is unlikely to be suspended from voting in the EU since Poland and the Czech Republic have said they would back Orban and veto any sanction against Hungary.
""Europe stood by us, now it is our turn,"" the organizers of Sunday's rally in Budapest said in a statement on their Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. ""Orban and his Fidesz party lost in European parliament, and Hungary has won.""
Demonstrators at the rally waved both Hungarian and EU flags.
Since he came to power in 2010, Orban has used his parliamentary majority to pressure courts, media and non-government groups in ways his opponents say breach European Union rules. He has been one of the strongest opponents of the EU's migration policies. 

The leftist opposition of the Democratic Coalition, and the Socialists and Parbeszed (Dialogue) party is in disarray after Orban won a third consecutive term in April with a landslide election victory.

The proposed change, already amended by Putin, envisages raising the retirement age for men to 65, from 60, and to 60, from 55, for women and is the most unpopular government measure in Russia since a 2005 move to scrap Soviet-era benefits.
Sunday's protest in Russia's second city was smaller than rallies a week ago in 80 towns and cities that were organized by jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny. More than 800 people were detained during those demonstrations, the bulk of them in Saint Petersburg after the authorities there initially authorized a rally before reversing their decision.
The local branch of the Interior Ministry said that around 500 people had taken part in Sunday's protest, which was held without ""gross violations of public order."" 
OVD-Info, a human rights organization that monitors detentions, said that three people had been detained during the rally. 
The proposed pension changes, which are currently going through parliament, have shaved around 15 percentage points off Putin's popularity rating.

Britain has charged two Russian men, identified as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, with attempting to murder Skripal and his daughter Yulia by spraying a chemical weapon on Skripal's front door in the southern English city of Salisbury in March.
""The fact is that neither Petrov nor Boshirov have nothing to do with Putin, and the Kremlin of course,"" Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying. 
Putin said on Wednesday that the two men were civilians and that there was ""nothing special and criminal"" about them.
The duo appeared on Russia's state-funded RT television station on Thursday, insisting they were innocent tourists who had flown to London for fun and visited the city of Salisbury to see its cathedral.
Britain has said the two men were Russian military intelligence officers almost certainly acting on orders from high up in the Russian state. Russia has vehemently denied any involvement in the incidents.
Skripal - a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who betrayed dozens of agents to Britain's MI6 foreign intelligence service - and his daughter were found slumped unconscious on a bench in Salisbury in March. They spent weeks in hospital before being discharged.

TAJI, Iraq (Reuters) - German forces will be needed in Iraq for a long time to help rebuild the country's military as it struggles to ensure that Islamic State militants do not regroup in underground cells, German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday.
Germany, which has about 125 soldiers in Iraq, is committed to supporting Baghdad as it rebuilds now that the fight to reclaim territory formerly held by Islamic State (IS)militants is largely over, she said during a visit to German troops at the Taji military base about 30 kms north of Baghdad.
""The fight against IS left deep wounds and scars in the country. It will take patience ... to strengthen Iraq again,"" she said when asked why Germany was bracing for a longer-term engagement in Iraq. ""This is about a reconstruction of a country in all areas.""
Iraq not only needed stability but also economic growth and cooperation, von der Leyen told reporters, noting that Germany had invested about 1.4 billion euros ($1.63 billion)in Iraq since 2014.
Germany this year began shifting its military training activities to the central part of Iraq after focusing in the past more on training Kurdish Peshmerga forces in northern Iraq.
German forces will also advise the Iraqi defense ministry on issues such as mine-clearing and development of defenses against nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, von der Leyen said.
She welcomed news that Iraq's parliament had elected Sunni lawmaker Mohammed al-Halbousi as speaker on Saturday, calling it an important step in the right direction.
Von der Leyen, whose government is in talks about a possible role for Germany in military strikes against future chemical weapons use in Syria, said all players in the possible future Iraqi government had said they hoped for Germany's longer-term commitment to Iraq.
On Saturday, during a visit to German forces in Jordan, von der Leyen had said she could not rule out a longer-term deployment of German forces in the Middle East.

The victim, Ari Fuld, 45, was well-known amongst settlers as a pro-Israel advocate. According to his Twitter account, he had planned a lecture tour in the United States in November.
Israeli police said the Palestinian who stabbed him in the back at a shopping mall in the Etzion bloc of Jewish settlements south of Jerusalem was shot and wounded by one of several armed civilians - including a bleeding Fuld - who gave chase.
The suspected assailant, identified in Israeli media as a 17-year-old from a West Bank village, was taken into custody.
Palestinian street attacks against Israelis, many carried out by assailants with no known affiliation to militant groups, have been sporadic since 2015, a year after peace talks collapsed.
Fawzi Barhoum, a spokesman for the Hamas militant group that rules the Gaza Strip, called the West Bank stabbing a ""natural response to Israeli crimes against Palestinians"" in occupied territory. It did not claim responsibility for the attack.
David Friedman, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, said on Twitter that ""America grieves as one of its citizens was brutally murdered by a Palestinian terrorist.""
Friedman, who raised money for Jewish settlements as a private citizen, said Fuld ""represented the best of both countries and will be deeply missed"". Fuld, a father of four, lived in the settlement of Efrat, in the Etzion area.

Most countries view Israeli settlements, on occupied land Palestinians claim for a state as illegal. Israel disputes this.

BERLIN (Reuters) - An anti-Kremlin activist lost his sight, hearing and his ability to walk in a suspected poisoning last week but is doing better since he arrived in Berlin for treatment, according to a member of the Pussy Riot band and a newspaper.
Pyotr Verzilov, publisher of a Russian online news outlet and affiliated with the anti-Kremlin punk band Pussy Riot, arrived in Berlin from Moscow late on Saturday on a medical transport plane, said Jaka Bizilj, managing director of the Berlin-based Cinema for Peace organization. The human rights group paid for the transport, and Bizilj said that Russia had been ""cooperative"" in the matter.
Photographs taken by Bizilj at Berlin's Schoenefeld airport showed Verzilov on a stretcher, his eyes closed, as he was being transferred to an ambulance.
""He's better. Everything is okay,"" a member of Pussy Riot, Veronika Nikulshina, told Reuters from Verzilov's hospital room. ""The doctors here are great."" She made no further comment.
Verzilov was being treated at the Charite hospital in Berlin, according to a source familiar with the matter. The hospital declined to comment.
German newspaper Bild, which first reported Verzilov's arrival, on Saturday quoted family members as saying he had lost his sight, his ability to speak and his ability to walk. 
Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Verzilov's wife and a Pussy Riot member, told the newspaper she believed he was poisoned. ""I believe that he was poisoned intentionally, and that it was an attempt to intimidate him or kill him,"" she said.
Nikulshina told the BBC that a friend of Verzilov's father would treat him. ""We are taking Petya to Berlin because there is a friend of his father there, a doctor who will be taking care of (him),"" she said, using the diminutive form of Pyotr.
Bizilj said Verzilov had both Russian and Canadian citizenship. He said doctors at the clinic were expected to inform the public on Monday about the activist's condition.
The Canadian embassy in Berlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The German foreign ministry declined to comment, citing Germany's strict privacy laws.
Verzilov, 30, is publisher of Mediazona, a Russian online news outlet which focuses on human rights violations inside Russia's penal system. He staged a brief pitch invasion during the soccer World Cup final in Moscow in July along with three women affiliated with Pussy Riot. 
He became ill after attending a court hearing in Moscow on Tuesday and later suffered seizures while in an ambulance en route to a hospital in Moscow, Bizilj said in a news release. 
It was not clear if the medical transfer was discussed at a meeting on Friday between German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. 

Pussy Riot came to prominence in 2012 when its members were jailed for staging a protest against Russian President Vladimir Putin in a Russian Orthodox cathedral in Moscow. The group has since become a symbol of anti-Kremlin protest action.

(Reuters) - Texas police on Saturday arrested a veteran U.S. Border Patrol agent, who is suspected of killing four women within the past two weeks and kidnapping a fifth.
Juan David Ortiz, a 35-year-old who has worked for the Border Patrol for a decade, was found hiding in a Laredo parking lot after a woman he allegedly abducted was able to escape and alert law enforcement, officials said.
""We feel that our efforts have gathered strong evidence against this killer. Our community is safe from this killer,"" Webb County Sheriff Martin Cuellar said in a statement.
Ortiz was charged late on Saturday with four counts of murder, aggravated assault and unlawful restraint, Webb County, Texas District Attorney Isidro Alaniz said in a tweet.
It was unclear if Ortiz had an attorney or if bond was set.
The four victims' names were not immediately disclosed. Local media in Laredo, 150 miles (240 km) southwest of San Antonio, said they had been working as prostitutes.
The bodies of two of the women were discovered this month along Interstate 35 in rural northwest Webb County, the Laredo Morning Times reported, while the third and fourth were found in the same area this weekend. 
A senior U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) official, Andrew Meehan, said in a statement the agency was cooperating fully with the investigators.

PARIS (Reuters) - Close allies of the French president rounded on the opposition-led senate, warning it against abusing its power and seeking to undermine the presidency after it compelled Emmanuel Macron's former bodyguard to answer questions over his violent conduct.
Alexandre Benalla is under criminal investigation after he was filmed beating a protester while wearing a riot helmet and police tags, a scandal that has plunged Macron's presidency into its gravest crisis since he won power in May 2017.
On Wednesday Benalla agreed to face questioning by senators after being told he risked prison if he refused to comply with the parliamentary inquiry.
Macron's lieutenants have cautioned the Senate against over-reaching its powers and encroaching on a judicial investigation. Opponents of the president fired back, denouncing what they called an unprecedented attack on parliament.
""Any commission of enquiry that was to have political ambitions...and was to think it could use its role as a check on government to bring down a president would be violating the constitution,"" Christophe Castaner, leader of Macron's Republic on the Move party (LREM), told a news conference on Friday. 
While the criminal probe is investigating Benalla's actions during the May Day protest, the inquiry by the opposition-led Senate is looking into the Elysee Palace's internal operations and whether it tried to keep the affair hushed up. 
On Saturday, it was Macron's justice minister who took aim at the senate committee: ""It would be shocking if the executive were to interfere in a legal case. It would be no less so were parliament to do the same,"" Nicole Belloubet wrote in Le Monde.
UNPRECEDENTED RIFT
Macron dismissed the Benalla affair as a ""storm in a tea cup"" when it erupted in July, but it has reinforced a perception among many French of a president who acts like a monarch and undermined his claim of building an ""exemplary Republic"".
Benalla's public questioning on Wednesday will keep the scandal in the public eye just as Macron tries to reverse a dramatic slump in popularity over the summer. 
Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the far-left France Unbowed party, said Macron and his allies were locked in a battle with the Senate that was without precedent.
""By exporting its crisis of authority, the presidency is amplifying the turmoil and weakening the democratic institutions,"" Melenchon wrote on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account.
At least two LREM senators sitting on the investigating committee have said they will not take part in Benalla's questioning, French media reported.
The center-right party The Republicans, which controls the senate, has not recovered from Macron's demolition of the mainstream parties in last year's election, but denies it is seeking to make political gains from the Benalla scandal.
In a dig at parliament's lower house, which is dominated by the ruling party and refused to launch an inquiry into the scandal, Senate President Bruno Retailleau said the upper house was conducting its work with ""absolute rigor"".

""I want to tell Emmanuel Macron...that only Louis XIV believed that there was no one who could check his power,"" Retailleau told Europe 1 radio.

The relevant agencies in Taiwan must end such activities immediately, the official Xinhua news agency said, citing An Fengshan, a spokesman of China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office. 
On Saturday, state television kicked off the first in a series of programs detailing cases in which Chinese students studying in Taiwan are said to be targeted by domestic spies who lure them with money, love and friendship. 
The allegations come as China ramps up efforts to encourage Taiwanese to settle in China permanently, with new identity cards and other inducements. 
Taiwan has warned its people to be careful of the risks involved living in an autocratic country with internet censorship and other drawbacks.
China and Taiwan frequently trade accusations of spying. 
In 2017, a Chinese student studying in Taiwan was sentenced to prison for collecting sensitive information through contacts in Taiwan schools and government departments, and for trying to build a spy network on the island. 
Taiwan started to allow Chinese students to study at its universities in 2009. 
China sees democratic Taiwan as a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring it to heel, a prospect of which Taiwan is often reminded, with Chinese warships and fighter jets periodically pressing close to the island. 
In recent months, China has also lured away some of the few nations with diplomatic ties to the self-ruled island. 

But as Beijing further isolates Taiwan, Taipei is discreetly nurturing security ties with regional powers by sharing intelligence of Chinese military deployments, sources have told Reuters.

YANGON (Reuters) - At least 100 Myanmar youth activists and journalists called for the release of two jailed Reuters journalists on Sunday, warning that the seven-year prison terms handed to the pair this month threaten the public's right to information.
Demonstrators including high-school students gathered peacefully in the heart of Myanmar's largest city, Yangon, held signs and chanted slogans denouncing the guilty verdict against the two journalists. A small contingent of police looked on as the protesters released black balloons printed with the words ""Free Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo"". 
Reporters Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were convicted on Sept. 3 under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act in a case that was seen as a test of democratic freedoms in Myanmar.
Thar Lun Zaung Htet, a journalist involved in organizing the protest, said the verdict against reporters who were ""just doing their job"" would stifle reporting in Myanmar.
""Losing press freedom means our democratic transition is going backwards,"" he said.
The verdict drew calls from senior United Nations officials, political figures including U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and human rights advocates around the world for their immediate release. 
Government spokesman Zaw Htay could not be reached for comment on Sunday.
The country's leader Aung San Suu Kyi said at a forum in Hanoi last week the case had nothing to do with freedom of expression. The reporters had been sentenced for handling official secrets and ""were not jailed because they were journalists"", the Nobel laureate said.
On Friday six Myanmar journalist organizations published a rare statement from groups within the country criticizing the country's leader, saying they were ""disappointed"" with her comments.
The reporters, who plead not guilty, said they were handed rolled papers by police shortly before they were detained last December, and a police witness testified in court that they had been set up.
The reporters had been investigating the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys by security forces and local Buddhists amid a military response to insurgent attacks last August. 
Some 700,000 Rohingya crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh fleeing the crackdown, which U.N.-mandated investigators said last month was launched by senior Myanmar generals with ""genocidal intent"". 
Signs held by the protesters on Sunday included the messages ""Murder is not a state secret"" and ""revealing the truth is not a crime"". 
One organizer, Maung Saung Kha, performed a short play where he put on a military jacket over the orange traditional Burmese jacket worn by lawmakers of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy. He then rolled up a copy of the state-run daily The Mirror and began hitting members of the press with it.
Activist Htet Khine Soe said the ""injustice"" of the case against the reporters had led him to design a T-shirt with an illustration of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo's faces. The design was worn by some demonstrators and was also used on stickers placed around Yangon.

""We need to know what's happening in the world. We need journalists for that,"" he said. ""Without that, we will be stupid people without ears and eyes.""

HONG KONG/MANILA (Reuters) - A super typhoon made landfall in China's Guangdong on Sunday, the country's most populous province, after wreaking havoc in Hong Kong and Macau and killing at least 29 people in the Philippines. 
Packing gale force winds of more than 200 kph (125 mph), tropical cyclone Mangkhut is considered the strongest to hit the region this year, equivalent to a maximum Category 5 ""intense hurricane"" in the Atlantic.
The eye of Mangkhut, the Thai name for Southeast Asia's mangosteen fruit, skirted 100 km (62 miles) south of Hong Kong but the former British colony was still caught in the typhoon's swirling bands of rain and gale-force winds. 
Hong Kong raised its highest No. 10 typhoon signal at mid-morning as ferocious winds uprooted trees and smashed windows in office and residential buildings, some of which swayed in the gusts, residents said.
""It swayed for quite a long time, at least two hours. It made me feel so dizzy,"" said Elaine Wong, who lives in a high-rise tower in Kowloon.
Water levels surged 3.5 m (12 ft) in some places, waves swamped roads and washed up live fish, washing into some residential blocks and a mall in an eastern district.
""It's the worst I've seen,"" resident Martin Wong told Reuters. ""I've not seen the roads flood like this, (and) the windows shake like this, before.""
The plans of tens of thousands of travelers were disrupted by flight cancellations at Hong Kong's international airport, a major regional hub. Airlines such as flagship carrier Cathay Pacific canceled many flights last week.
Philippine authorities said a baby and a toddler were among the 29 dead, most of them in landslides in mountainous areas that left at least 13 missing.
""The landslides happened as some residents returned to their homes after the typhoon,"" disaster response coordinator Francis Tolentino told DZMM Radio, adding that most of the 5.7 million people affected had made advance preparations.
""It was not so severe as we expected it to be because earlier it was noted it would also be strong,"" said President Rodrigo Duterte, following an aerial survey of some affected areas. 
In Macau, which halted casino gambling late on Saturday and put China's People's Liberation Army on standby for disaster relief help, some streets were flooded. 
""The suspension is for the safety of casino employees, visitors to the city, and residents,"" said authorities in the world's largest gambling hub, who faced criticism last year after a typhoon that killed nine and caused severe damage.
China has ordered thousands of boats to return to harbor, and evacuated thousands of offshore oil platform workers, the state news agency, Xinhua, said.

The typhoon, dubbed the ""King of Storms"" by Chinese media, made landfall in Haiyan town at 5:00 p.m. local time, packing winds of more than 160 kph (100 mph), weather officials said. 
Ports, oil refineries and industrial plants in the area have been shut. Power to some areas were also reduced as a precaution. In Shenzhen, electricity supply to more than 130,000 homes was cut at one point on Sunday. 
The storm has fueled concern about sugar production in Guangdong, which accounts for a tenth of national output, at about 1 million tonnes. China sugar futures rose last week on fears for the cane crop. 
Guangdong is also China's most populous province, with a population of more than 100 million. 
The airport in the boomtown of Shenzhen has been shut since midnight, and will be closed until 8:00 a.m. (2400 GMT) on Monday. Flights have been canceled in Guangzhou and the neighboring island province of Hainan.
High winds and swells have also hit Fujian province north of Guangdong, shutting ports, suspending ferry services and cancelling more than 100 flights. Waves as high as 7.3 meters (24 ft) were sighted in the Taiwan Strait, Xinhua said. 

Mangkhut's northwesterly track will bring heavy rain and winds to the autonomous region of Guangxi early on Monday, before it weakens into a tropical depression to reach southwestern Yunnan next day.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia will begin a public inquiry, or Royal Commission, into the country's aged-care sector as a spike in cases of elderly abuse creates a ""disturbing trend"", Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday.
The inquiry comes at a time when the number of Australians moving into residential care is set to jump, with the population aged 65 years and above, according to official data, forecast to more than double to 8.9 million by 2055.
""I think we should brace ourselves for some pretty bruising information about the way our loved ones, some of them have experienced some real mistreatment,"" Morrison said.
Over the past year, one service provider on an average has been shut down daily by the government, revealing ""a very disturbing trend in what is happening in terms of non-compliance and abuses and failures of care"", he added.
Australia's A$20 billion ($14 billion) aged-care industry, which accounts for about 1.2 percent of its GDP, has about 2,000 care service providers offering home support, home care and residential care. Some of the industry's listed players include Japara Healthcare and Regis Healthcare.
Government figures show there has been a 177 percent surge in services with serious risks to residents identified in the sector in the past year. The number of facilities that refused to comply with rules jumped almost four fold.
Cases where facilities would have residents at risk have risen to 61 from two over the last three years. 
""The issue isn't just in metro centers or just in rural centers, it is not just in for-profit or non-profit,"" Morrison said. ""It is right across, as best as we can determine from the compliance work that has been done today, so we do want to look right across the board at what is occurring.""
Labour party leader, Bill Shorten, the largest opposition party to the ruling Liberal-National coalition, told ABC TV on Sunday that there is a ""national crisis"" in aged care.
""I don't think that I'm fearmongering and I'm pleased that the government is moving in the same direction,"" he said. 
A Royal Commission https://uk.reuters.com/article/australia-banks-inquiry/factbox-australian-royal-commissions-idUKL3N1O01QT is Australia's most powerful type of government inquiry, particularly because it has the power to compel witnesses. It can cover a range of subjects deemed to be in public interest, from individual to broad industry matters.
One such inquiry is currently roiling Australia's banking, funds-management and the pension fund sector with daily revelations of serious misconduct.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Two people died, a dozen more were hospitalized and hundreds others sought medical assistance after suspected drug overdoses at a music festival in Sydney, the police said.
A 23-year-old man and a 21-year-old woman died on Saturday after collapsing at the Defqon.1 festival, the police said. Two of the 13 hospitalized people remain in critical condition, while about 700 sought assistance on site. 
The police has charged 10 people with drug supply offences, including two teenagers who allegedly carried 120 capsules to the festival, held at the Sydney International Regatta Center.
""I'm absolutely aghast at what has occurred, I don't want any family to go through the tragedy that some families are waking up to this morning, it's just horrible to think about,"" the premier of the Australian state of New South Wales, Gladys Berejiklian, said. 
""This is an unsafe event and I'll be doing everything I can to make sure it never happens again,"" she added.
In 2013 and 2015, two men in their 20s died while attending the festival, both of suspected drug overdose. 
The festival, an annual event held in Australia since 2009, has been organized by Q-Dance Australia, part of the Dutch event organizer Q-Dance.
On Sunday, the organizers said they were ""deeply saddened"" by the deaths.
""We are disappointed at the number of reported drug-related incidents, we have a zero-tolerance policy in relation to drug use at the festival,"" Defqon.1 said in a statement published by the Sydney Morning Herald.

A year after their first fight ended in a controversial draw, Alvares survived a late barrage from Golovkin to clinch a points decision in front of a frenzied capacity crowd at T-Mobile Arena.
Two judges scored it 115-113 for Alvares, while the other had it a 114-114 draw.
Golovkin landed some huge head shots in the closing rounds, opening a big cut above Alvares' left eye, but the Mexican held on to improve his career record to 50-1-2, including 34 knockouts.
Golovkin fell to 38-1-1, with 34 knockouts.
""It was a very tight fight,"" said Alvares in a ringside interview after becoming the WBC, WBA, IBO and Ring Magazine world champion.
""I looked for a knockout but it's difficult. He's a great fighter but in the end I got the victory.
""I'm very excited, very emotional. I want to thank everyone who believes in me. This is for them and long live Mexico.""

The Archdiocese of Santiago said the Pope had decided to defrock the Reverend Cristian Precht, local daily El Mercurio reported.
Precht was a former head of the Church's Vicariate of Solidarity human rights group that in the 1980s had challenged ex-dictator Augusto Pinochet to end the practice of torture in Chile. 
The well-known Chilean religious leader has since been accused of sexual abuse as part of the investigation into allegations against members of the Marist Brothers religious community.
Precht has previously denied the charges.
Pope Francis´ announcement comes as Chilean police raid church offices throughout the Andean nation looking for new cases of sexual abuse or evidence that church officials concealed abuse from authorities.
The Catholic Church worldwide is reeling from crises involving sexual abuse of minors, deeply damaging confidence in the Church in Chile, but also in the United States, Australia, and Ireland where the scandal has hit hardest, and elsewhere.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Five people died after a dramatic shootout at a famed Mexico City mariachi plaza, officials said on Saturday, the latest in a recent string of crimes in the capital that will soon put to the test the incoming government's new tactics to fight violence.
At Plaza Garibaldi in the capital's historic downtown on Friday night, gunmen said by witnesses to be dressed as mariachi musicians opened fire with pistols and rifles, injuring eight and sending onlookers running and screaming. The incident left three men and two women dead, city officials said.
Homicides have surged since 2014 in Mexico City, an arts, food and culture hotspot for tourists from around the globe that has been spared much of the drug violence plaguing cartel strongholds, which has even hit resort towns Cancun, Los Cabos and Acapulco.
The capital is on track to register a record number of homicides this year, and reversing that trend is part of incoming President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's enormous challenge to stem crime and violence nationwide.
The former Mexico City mayor, who takes office Dec. 1, has vowed that new strategies under the city's incoming mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum, will be effective.
""I am sure they will resolve the problems that are being suffered in Mexico City ... Claudia will restore peace,"" he told local media on Saturday when asked about plans to halt violence in the capital. 
Sheinbaum's priorities are to stamp out police corruption and improve the implementation of a U.S.-style justice reform, she said in a recent interview.
In contrast, the current government adopted an intense surveillance strategy in recent months, deploying low-flying helicopters meant to intimidate drug dealers and robbers. 
Plaza Garibaldi borders Mexico City's notorious Tepito neighborhood, home to La Union gang, which police say is behind a surge of drug-dealing and protection rackets.
The historic site is also blocks from one of Latin America's largest public squares, where thousands will flock on Saturday night to see President Enrique Pena Nieto deliver the traditional cry of ""Long Live Mexico!"" to celebrate Independence Day. 
Similar festivities planned for two cities in Guerrero and another in Guanajuato were canceled due to recent violence, local media said.

Police blame much of the capital's crime on retail drug dealing and protection rackets run by violent gangs, though the government says at least one of these has links to a national trafficking group, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.

Members of the Pussy Riot protest band with whom Verzilov collaborated have suggested he may have been poisoned.
Bild said the activist would be transferred to an unnamed Berlin clinic for treatment, and quoted family members as saying he had lost his sight, his ability to speak and his ability to walk.
""I believe that he was poisoned intentionally, and that it was an attempt to intimidate him or kill him,"" his wife Nadeschda Verzilov, who was waiting for her husband at Berlin's Schoenefeld airport, told the newspaper.
Verzilov, 30, staged a brief pitch invasion during the soccer World Cup final in Moscow in July along with three women affiliated with the anti-Kremlin punk band. He is the publisher of Mediazona, a Russian online news outlet which focuses on human rights violations inside Russia's penal system.

Pussy Riot came to prominence in 2012 when its members were jailed for staging a protest against Putin in a Russian Orthodox cathedral in Moscow. The group has since become a symbol of anti-Kremlin protest action.

Britain is due to leave the European Union on March 29. But with Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plans still not accepted, some lawmakers, as well as union and business leaders are increasingly arguing for people to have a final say on any deal struck with Brussels.
May has repeatedly ruled out holding a second referendum following the vote two years ago to leave the EU. She says members of parliament will get to vote on whether to accept any final deal.
The intervention in favor of a second referendum from Khan, a senior member of Britain's opposition Labour Party, will put more pressure on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to also support the second referendum idea.
Labour is due to start its four-day annual party conference in a week's time.
Writing in Sunday's Observer newspaper, Khan blamed the government's handling of the negotiations and said the threat to living standards, the economy and jobs was too great for voters not to have a say.

""This means a public vote on any Brexit deal obtained by the government, or a vote on a 'no-deal' Brexit if one is not secured, alongside the option of staying in the EU,"" he wrote in the newspaper.

WILSON, N.C. (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Florence dumped ""epic"" amounts of rain on North and South Carolina as it trudged inland on Saturday, triggering dangerous flooding, toppling trees, cutting power to nearly a million homes and businesses while causing at least six deaths.
Florence's intensity has diminished since it roared ashore along the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast on Friday as a hurricane. But its slow march over the two states, crawling west at only 2 miles per hour (3 km per hour), threatens to leave much of the region under water in the coming days.
(GRAPHIC: Hurricane Florence to pummel U.S. Southeast for days - https://tmsnrt.rs/2oZFKSb)
""This system is unloading epic amounts of rainfall, in some places measured in feet and not inches,"" North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news briefing about a storm that forecasters said was 300 miles (480 km) wide.
With flood waters rising rapidly in many communities, people trapped in homes awaited rescue, while tens of thousands hunkered down in shelters after fleeing their homes as the storm approached. Authorities warned about potential landslides and numerous roads were closed.
Utility crews worked to restore electricity. An estimated 772,000 people remained without power in North Carolina, 172,000 in South Carolina.
In Wilmington, a city of about 120,000 on North Carolina's Atlantic coastline along the Cape Fear River that is home to historic mansions and a decommissioned World War Two-era battleship, streets were strewn with downed tree limbs and carpeted with leaves and other debris. Electricity remained out for much of the city, with power lines lying across many roads like wet strands of spaghetti.
'A BLESSING'
""The fact that there haven't been more deaths and damage is amazing and a blessing,"" said Rebekah Roth, walking around Wilmington's Winoca Terrace neighborhood.
The National Hurricane Center said the storm would dump as much as 30 to 40 inches (76-102 cm) of rain on the southeastern coast of North Carolina and part of northeastern South Carolina, as well as up to 10 inches (25 cm) in southwestern Virginia.
Fayetteville, a city of about 210,000 people about 90 miles (145 km) inland, issued a mandatory evacuation order for thousands of residents near Cape Fear River because of flooding. Fort Bragg, a sprawling U.S. Army base, is just west of Fayetteville.
At 2 p.m. EDT (1500 GMT), the hurricane center said Florence had maximum sustained winds near 45 miles per hour (75 km per hour) and continued to produce catastrophic flooding in the Carolinas. It said it was located about 50 miles (65 km) west of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and forecasters predicted a slow westward march.
Cooper said many people in his state who may think the storm has missed them have not yet seen its actual threat to their regions, advising residents inland that rivers will rise days after the rain has stopped.
He said five deaths were confirmed from the storm in North Carolina and ""several others are under investigation,"" and urged people to heed evacuation orders.
Authorities in South Carolina reported their first death from the storm, saying a woman died in a car crash on Highway 18 in Union County late on Friday when the roof of her vehicle struck a fallen tree. 
Florence already has set a North Carolina record for rainfall totals, exceeding that of Hurricane Floyd, which struck in 1999 and caused 56 deaths. Floyd produced 24 inches (61 cm) of rain in some parts of North Carolina while Florence already has dumped about 30 inches (76 cm) in areas around Swansboro.
""It's like being stalked by a turtle,"" Federal Emergency Management Agency official Jeff Byard told reporters.
On Thursday, Florence was a Category 3 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale with 120-mph winds (193 km). It was downgraded to Category 1 before coming ashore on Friday near Wrightsville Beach, near Wilmington.
In New Bern, at the confluence of the Neuse and Trent rivers in North Carolina, Florence overwhelmed the town of 30,000. 
The downtown area was under water in New Bern, a town dating to the early 18th century. Officials said more than 100 people were rescued from floods on Friday, with 60 to 75 awaiting rescue on Saturday. Some residents described a harrowing retreat as the storm hit.
""It was pitch black and I was just scared out of my mind,"" said Tracy Singleton, who with her family later drove through torrential rain and high winds from her home near New Bern to a hotel some 80 miles (130 km) away.
More than 20,000 people were in 157 shelters in North Carolina, with 7,000 in South Carolina shelters.
Schoolteacher Leslie Ochoa said she and her family loaded up 10 adults, 5 children, 14 goats, 10 dogs, two cats and one guinea pig and evacuated from Jacksonville, North Carolina to Columbia, South Carolina last Tuesday. As her son fed the goats in a hotel parking lot, she said she might not be able to return home until the middle of next week.
""Our friend behind our old house, they have gators swimming in the water. So yeah, not safe,"" Ochoa said.
The White House said President Donald Trump approved making federal funding available in some counties. Trump plans a visit to the region next week.

As the United States dealt with Florence, a strong typhoon tore across the northern tip of the Philippines on Saturday, killing at least three people, wrecking homes and triggering landslides before heading toward Hong Kong and southern China.

Railing against tax fraud and mega-investments in fossil fuels by the world's biggest banks, the protesters in the French capital lit orange smoke bombs and spilled a fluorescent green liquid on the pavement to symbolize what they called toxic money.
""Big banks are a driving force of fiscal evasion,"" said Aurelie Trouve, a spokeswoman for Attac France.

""It's inevitable, there's going to be another crisis,"" Coutrot said.

Von der Leyen spoke during a visit to the Azraq air base in Jordan where some 300 German troops support a refueling plane and four Tornado warplanes that fly reconnaissance missions as part of U.S. led-coalition operations against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
Asked if Germany needed a strategic base in the Middle East, von der Leyen said, ""First we must bring this deployment to a successful end. I don't want to rule the idea out, let me put it this way.""
Von der Leyen and other German officials on Wednesday called for concerted efforts to prevent chemical weapons being used in Syria, and Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany could not simply look away if such attacks took place.
The German government said it was in talks with the United States and other allies about possible participation in military intervention if chemical weapons were used in attacks on Idlib, the last major rebel-held enclave in Syrian.
The news has divided the German ruling coalition, with the Social Democrats, ruling any such action out unless it is sanctioned by the United Nations. 
Germany, under pressure from the United States to boost defense spending and take on more responsibility within NATO, did not take part in April military strikes by U.S., French and British forces on Syria after a chemical weapons attack.
The United States has pledged to surpass that if Syria uses chemical weapons again.

Washington last month asked Berlin about its willingness to participate in military action together with France and Britain, if another chemical weapons attack took place. A leaked report about the query has triggered emotional debate in a country whose Nazi past keeps military action a sensitive issue.

LAMU, Kenya (Reuters) - Kenyan islanders have built a boat made entirely of recycled plastic collected during clean-ups of the ocean to highlight the growing menace of plastic waste that ends up in the sea. 
Last year, the Kenyan government imposed the world's toughest law against plastic bags, with offenders - including producers, retailers, and ordinary Kenyans - risking imprisonment for up to four years or fines of $40,000, in a bid to reduce plastic pollution.
Many bags drift into the ocean, strangling turtles, suffocating seabirds and filling the stomachs of dolphins and whales. 
The construction of the boat has been dubbed the FlipFlopi project because of the hundreds of recycled plastic sandals that cover the vessel. 
The nine-meter sailing dhow, which the team built from over 10 tonnes of plastic waste, sailed for the first time in the waters off Kenya's Lamu island on Saturday.
Its launch coincided with international World Cleanup Day, during which environmental groups carry out activities to tackle pollution. 
The boat is a riot of color, including red, green, blue and yellow, due to the re-purposed flip flops used to cover the hull and other parts.
""We hope people around the globe are inspired by our beautiful multicolored boat and find their own ways to re-purpose already-used plastics,"" said Ben Morrison, the founder of the FlipFlopi project.
Morrison, who spent a decade building a travel business focused on Africa, turned to constructing colorful boats in 2016, when he noticed alarming pollution along the Kenyan coast.
The team used Kenyan facilities and technologies to recycle the plastic waste, and was led by local boat builder Ali Abdalla Skanda.
""We are proud to be a guide to the world and its inhabitants during this vital time of challenge for our ocean environment,"" Skanda said, adding they had received support from around the world as they built the boat. 
Najib Balala, the Kenyan tourism minister, praised the team when he attended the launch at Lamu island, a protected world heritage site popular with local and foreign holidaymakers, on Kenya's far north coastline.
Tourism is one of the top hard currency earners for Kenya and officials in Nairobi are keen to protect beach resorts along the coastline.

JERICHO, West Bank (Reuters) - The United States will not present its long-awaited plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace any time soon and is instead trying to unilaterally change the terms of reference for any future proposal, a senior Palestinian official said on Saturday.
Echoing deep scepticism among the Palestinians, Arab countries and analysts, Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian chief negotiator, said that the Trump administration was siding with Israel on the core issues of the decades-old conflict, burying all chances for Middle East peace.
""I don't think they will ever introduce a plan,"" Erekat said in an interview with Reuters in Jericho. ""The whole world is rejecting their ideas. They are already implementing their plan by changing the terms of reference,"" he said. 
Doubts have mounted over whether Trump's administration can secure what he has called the ""ultimate deal"" since December, when the U.S. President recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and then moved the U.S. Embassy there. 
Jerusalem is one of the major issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Both sides claim it as a capital. Trump's move outraged the Palestinians, who have since boycotted Washington's peace efforts, led by the U.S. president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
The United States has also cut off aid to the Palestinians and to UNRWA - the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees -- and has ordered the PLO’s office in Washington shut, further angering Palestinian leaders.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday welcomed the latest U.S. moves.
Erekat said it appeared that the United States has accepted Israel's positions on other main issues of the conflict, and not just Jerusalem, including the fate of millions of Palestinian refugees from wars dating to 1948 and Israeli settlements on land Palestinians envisage as part of their future independent state.
But Trump's Mideast envoy Jason Greenblatt told Reuters in that Washington was prepared for Israeli criticism of the plan and that both sides can expect parts they will like and dislike. He provided no further details.
Greenblatt, a chief architect of the initiative, said U.S. negotiators had entered the ""pre-launch phase"" of the plan, despite the boycott by Palestinian leaders, but declined to specify a time frame.
The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem. Israel captured those territories in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed East Jerusalem in a move not recognized internationally. It regards all of the city as its eternal and indivisible capital.
U.S. officials have so far been non-committal about whether their plan would endorse the creation of a Palestinian state beside the state of Israel - the goal of previous rounds of negotiations, the last of which collapsed in 2014.
""They are telling us 'peace based on the truth',"" Erekat said.
""The Kushner truth and the Netanyahu truth is that Jerusalem is Israel's capital, no right of return to refugees, settlements are legal, no Palestinian state on 1967 (borders) and Gaza must be separated from the West Bank and this is absolutely unacceptable,"" Erekat said.
Palestinians have limited self-rule in the West Bank, but Israel controls most of that territory and has expanded its settlements there. Most countries deem the settlements illegal, though Israel disputes this. It withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza, which is ruled by the Islamist Hamas movement.

""The only thing this administration did since it came to office is just to take Israelis and Palestinians off the path to peace, off the path of the two-state solution,"" Erekat said.

ERBIL/SULAIMANIYA, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraq's parliament elected Sunni lawmaker Mohammed al-Halbousi as speaker on Saturday, marking an important step toward establishing a new government four months after an inconclusive national election.
Parliament had been due to elect a speaker and two deputies during its first meeting on Sept 3, but failed to do so as lawmakers were unable to determine which competing bloc had the most seats. 
Halbousi's election marks the start of a 90-day process outlined in the constitution, designed to eventually lead to a new government.
Lawmakers must next elect a new president and task the leader of the largest bloc to form a government as prime minister. But a dominant bloc has yet to emerge, against a backdrop of shifting political alliances.
Halbousi defeated former Defence Minister Khaled al-Obeidi, winning the position with 169 votes, according to Shi'ite lawmaker Husham al-Suhail. Iraq's parliament contains 329 seats.
Announcing the vote, the temporary leader of the assembly said Halbousi, 37, had become the youngest speaker of parliament in Iraq's history.
Before running in May's national election as a candidate on the Anbar Our Identity electoral list, Halbousi was the governor of Anbar province. He had previously served in Iraq's parliament, from 2014 to 2017.
Since Saddam Hussein was toppled in a 2003 U.S.-led invasion, power has been shared among Iraq's three largest ethnic-sectarian components. The prime minister has traditionally been a Shi'ite Arab, the speaker of parliament a Sunni Arab and the president a Kurd.
Iraqis voted in May in their first parliamentary election since the defeat of Islamic State’s self-declared caliphate, but a contentious recount process delayed the announcement of final results until last month.

Hans-Georg Maassen is facing calls to step down after he cast doubt on the authenticity of video footage showing far-right protesters chasing migrants in the eastern city of Chemnitz after the fatal stabbing of a German-Cuban man.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Interior Minister Horst Seehofer - both conservatives - have said the issue will not bring down their fragile ruling coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD), who are calling for Maassen's ouster.
Maassen, who has said his comments on Chemnitz were misunderstood, plans to expand his agency to match the size of the BND foreign intelligence service, which employs 6,500, Der Spiegel reported. The BfV currently has around 2,900 employees.
A spokesman for the interior ministry, which oversees the BfV agency, declined to comment on the Spiegel report, citing restrictions on public information about the agency.
Der Spiegel said Maassen planned to restructure the agency divisions responsible for counter-espionage, Islamist extremism and counter-sabotage to keep up with expanding threats. 
Merkel is due to meet Seehofer and SPD leaders on Tuesday to discuss Maassen's fate after failing to end the row on Thursday.

Police have arrested two migrants, an Iraqi and a Syrian, as suspects in the killing of the German-Cuban man, which triggered the worst far-right violence Germany has seen in decades and counter-protests by supporters of Merkel's liberal immigration polices.

Mohammed Javad Zarif told Germany's Der Spiegel news magazine that Iran could ""reduce its implementation"" of the agreement and possibly increase uranium enrichment activities if the nuclear agreement was jeopardized by ""the actions of the Americans and the passivity of the Europeans.""
""The Europeans and other signatories must act to offset the consequences of the U.S. sanctions,"" Zarif told the magazine, calling a package of measures drafted by Europe an important step that should now be implemented.
""What is paramount: Europe should do so not for Iran, but for its own sovereign and long-term economic interests.""
European Union officials strongly oppose the May decision by the United States to withdraw from the nuclear agreement, and have sought to salvage the deal in some form.
Germany on Friday said it was considering setting up a payment system with its European partners that would allow continued business transactions with Iran once U.S. sanctions kick in.
However, German officials concede privately that such a system would not prevent big companies that rely on U.S. exports to escape U.S. sanctions if they continue to sell to Iran.
Zarif said Tehran's biggest priority was to continue to sell a reasonable amount oil worldwide and return the proceeds to Iran, as well encouraging investment and cooperation in areas such as technology and research.
""Europe said the nuclear agreement was in its security interest. Then Europe must be ready to pay for its security,"" Zarif said. ""Nothing is for free.""
He said Europe should be ""ready to pay for its security"" by implementing a European Union ""blocking agreement"" under which it can punish European firms for withdrawing from Iranian business deals to avoid U.S. sanctions.
""The question is whether European wants its companies to follow European laws or American ones, or whether it will submit to the American dictates,"" Zarif said.
He said Iran had options to act if Europe failed to act to compensate Iran for the U.S. sanctions.
""We do not necessarily have to cancel (the agreement). Article 36 of the agreement and Security Resolution 2231 make it possible to reduce implementation, without cancelling it,"" he said.
Asked if Iran could resume increased enrichment of uranium, he said, ""That would be one of the possibilities.""
Zarif said Tehran would not ""waste its time"" on additional negotiations with the United States about Iran's behavior in the region unless Washington rescinded its decision to withdraw from the nuclear agreement.

""Only when Europe ensures that (the agreement) is implemented can Iran see if the attempt should be made to talk about other issues,"" he said.

PALERMO (Reuters) - Pope Francis appealed to Sicily's Mafia on Saturday to abandon a life of crime and violence, saying the island needed ""men and women of love, not men and women 'of honor,'"" using the term mobsters apply to themselves.
Francis, in the Sicilian capital, said organized crime members - many of whom go to church and worship openly - ""cannot believe in God and be Mafiosi"" at the same time. In his appeal, he referred to them as ""dear brothers and sisters"".
He visited Palermo to commemorate Father Giuseppe ""Pino"" Puglisi, a priest shot dead by Mafia hit men in 1993 because he challenged the organization's control over one of the city's toughest neighborhoods.
Puglisi was killed on his 56th birthday during a bloody Mafia offensive against the state and anyone else who threatened the group's existence. Magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino were killed by bombs in Palermo in 1992. 
""A person who is a Mafioso does not live as a Christian because with his life he blasphemes against the name of God,"" Francis said in the sermon of a Mass from some 80,000 people in the port area of the Sicilian capital.
The Catholic Church in southern Italy has had a checkered history of relations with the mob. Cardinal Ernesto Ruffini, who was archbishop of Palermo from 1945-1967, denied the Mafia's existence, considering communism the Church's biggest threat.
""I say to Mafiosi: Change, brothers and sisters! Stop thinking about yourselves and your money ... Convert yourselves to the real God, Jesus Christ, dear brothers and sisters,"" he said in his dockside sermon.
""I say to you, Mafiosi, if you don't do this, your very life will be lost and that will be your greatest defeat,"" he said.
""Today, we need men and women of love, not men and women of honor; men and women of service, not of oppression.""
Many members of organized crime groups in Italy, such as Sicily's Cosa Nostra and Calabria's Ndrangheta, see themselves as part of a religious, cult-like group, invoking the help of saints for their activities.
Particularly in smaller towns and cities in the south, they take part in Catholic sacraments and in some cases have also found complicity by some churchmen.
Puglisi refused to play along. With little support by the Church hierarchy in Sicily, he preached against the Mafia from the pulpit of his church in the rough Brancaccio neighborhood, then controlled by the Graviano family.
He helped young people in an area with high unemployment avoid the snare of the Mafia, asked parishioners to help police investigations, refused donations from mobsters and banned them from joining traditional religious street processions.
Puglisi's murder was ordered by local bosses Filippo and Giuseppe Graviano. The bothers and four men who planned or carried out the killing were convicted in 1998. All but one received life sentences.
One of the killers, who later turned state's evidence, said that as Puglisi was dying he said: ""I've been expecting you"".

In 2012, former Pope Benedict decreed that Puglisi died as a martyr in ""hatred of the faith,"" and ordered that he be beatified, the last step before sainthood in the Church.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish police have detained hundreds of workers protesting over labor conditions at Istanbul's new airport, a giant project championed by President Tayyip Erdogan and due to open next month, a union leader said on Saturday.
The protest broke out after a shuttle bus accident on Friday in which 17 workers were injured, said Ozgur Karabulut, general manager of the Dev Yapi-Is union.
Thousands of workers joined the demonstration, which was broken up by police and gendarmes deploying in riot control vehicles and firing tear gas, he said.
""They broke into the workers' camp with 30 gendarmerie, broke down the doors and detained around 500 workers,"" Karabulut told Reuters by phone. He said he was speaking from a local gendarmerie where he was seeking the workers's release.
Opposition parliamentarian Ali Bayar, from the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), put the number of those detained at around 400.
The workers' quarters ""look like a detention camp...When we went there this morning gendermarie soldiers were still detaining workers,"" Bayar told Reuters. 
The new airport, which Turkey says will become the biggest in the world, is one of the showcase projects of a 15-year construction boom under Erdogan who has overseen building of bridges, ports and railways which have transformed the country.
The growth has been fueled by cheap debt, however, and Erdogan said on Friday the government is freezing new investments to rein in inflation and support the lira, which has lost 40 percent against the dollar this year.
The airport is scheduled to open at the end of October, but Karabulut said that was in doubt because the remaining work would take another two months. 
Unions have long complained about working conditions and labor safety at the airport, but under a state of emergency imposed after a failed 2016 military coup and only lifted in July, rights to strike or protest were curtailed.
In February, Turkey's labor ministry said 27 workers had died at the airport since the start of work there in 2015, mainly from work accidents or health problems. 
Workers have also complained about poor food at the site, bed bugs in their sleeping quarters and delayed salaries. Pictures they posted online showed cracks in the ceilings and walls of the container homes where they are housed.
Airport operator IGA said its CEO Kadri Samsunlu had met union representatives and was looking into their complaints.
Karabulut said the union had received only verbal pledges from IGA and wanted commitments in writing. But he said many workers were unable to continue protesting. 

""Most of them had to go to work today under pressure and under threat,"" he said. ""So they went to work today unwillingly but they want the public to know that they will be protesting tonight if their friends are not released.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok is battling malaria, authorities said on Saturday, declaring a health emergency after a series of earthquakes in July and August forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes.
The quakes and aftershocks that killed nearly 500 people are estimated to have caused damages of 5 trillion rupiah ($337.84 million) to hospitals and public infrastructure, among other buildings, on the island's northern coast.
Lombok is less developed than its neighboring island of Bali, which is Indonesia's top tourist destination. 
After the quake, aid groups said many of the hundreds of thousands left homeless were camping in open fields, refusing to seek shelter indoors as tremors continued.
Women and children are among the 128 people found to have been infected with malaria, Rahman Sahnan Putra, the chief of the West Lombok Health Agency, told Reuters by telephone.
""It's an extraordinary occurrence of malaria,"" Putra said, confirming that an emergency had been declared.
The local government was seeking 3.4 billion rupiah ($230,000) from the central and regional governments to help fund mosquito nets, test kits and the emergency response effort, he added.
Although malaria is endemic in West Lombok, recent tests revealed a spurt in infections, another regional official said. 
""There was a mass blood survey and the entire community was checked,"" said Marjito, the chief of the health agency of West Nusatenggara, the province that is home to Lombok.
The incident was being treated as a ""standard outbreak"", Marjito said, adding that those testing positive for the disease are treated, counseled and their surroundings sprayed with disinfectant.
Many of those infected had been living in tents after the quakes and did not get proper rest, making them more vulnerable, he added.
""When people with malaria are weak, that's when issues arise,"" Marjito said, adding that authorities were mapping areas where malaria is endemic and planned to distribute thousands of mosquito nets as a preventive measure.
However, officials fear efforts to rein in the disease will be complicated by the arrival of the rainy season next month, as malaria-carrying mosquitoes breed in pools of stagnant water.
Assistance from the central government includes training for health officials in the use of microscopes to boost disease tracking, which had been disrupted by the disaster, said health ministry official Anung Sugihantono.
""When they started carrying out observations properly, they found more cases, and because of this, that area has declared a state of emergency,"" he added.

Following a week in which reports surfaced of a plot by Johnson's fellow eurosceptic colleagues to oust May, Johnson, bookmakers' favorite to succeed her, was quoted as saying he wanted her Chequers Brexit plan dropped, not her.
""It's not about the leadership. It's about the policy. It's not about changing prime minister. It's about chucking Chequers,"" he is reported to have told the newspaper at an event in Washington D.C. in the United States. 
Johnson quit as foreign secretary in July after May's Chequers proposal, named after a country house where it was put forward. It called for the free trade of goods with the EU, with Britain accepting a ""common rulebook"" that would apply to those goods. 
Opponents of the plan, like Johnson, say that would leave Britain subject to decisions made in Brussels without any input.
Since May's botched bet on a snap election in June 2017 lost her party its majority in parliament, she has faced persistent talk of a leadership challenge which has weakened her as she tries to clinch a Brexit deal with the EU.
The United Kingdom is due to leave the EU on March 29. The EU and Britain hope to clinch a deal later this year so parliaments on both sides can ratify it before Brexit.
Britain's opposition Labour Party created another headache for May on Friday, when one of its senior lawmakers told the Financial Times that the party would vote against any Brexit deal she reaches, predicting that the lack of a viable exit from the EU would force May from office before Christmas.

MANILA (Reuters) - A strong typhoon tore through the northern tip of the Philippines on Saturday packing winds of more than 200 kph (124 mph) along with torrential rain, killing three people and causing floods, landslides and power outages.
Mangkhut entered the Philippines as a super typhoon in the early hours, and sent winds and rains across the entire main island of Luzon, home to about half the country's 105 million people. 
Known locally as Ompong, Typhoon Mangkhut at one point had maximum gusts of 305 kph (190 mph) before it exited the land area before noon and moved towards southern China and Vietnam with reduced wind speeds of 170 kph (106 mph).
Two rescue workers were killed while trying to free people trapped in a landslide in the mountainous Cordillera region, said Ricardo Jalad, head of the nation's disaster agency. No further details were provided. Police also said a body had been found in a river in Manila.
Philippine state weather agency PAGASA downgraded the domestic threat level, but warned the danger was far from over, with continued storm surges and heavy rains that could trigger floods and more landslides.
""We are asking the people to remain alert and continue taking precautions,"" said PAGASA meteorologist Rene Paciente. 
(Graphic: Typhoon Mangkhut - https://tmsnrt.rs/2oZmnIS)
Rapid response teams were on stand by with the air force for search and rescue missions as authorities undertook damage assessments in areas in the path of the storm, which felled trees, electricity poles and tore off shop signs and sheet metal roofs hundreds of kilometers away.
There was flooding in several provinces and parts of the capital Manila. Authorities were preparing to release water from several dams, fearing constant rains could push reservoirs to dangerously high levels.
Mangkhut had been a category 5 storm for days since wreaking havoc in U.S. Pacific territories of Micronesia before edging towards the Philippines, where it is the 15th and strongest storm this year.
The typhoon's peak winds were stronger than those of Hurricane Florence, which killed five people in the United States after it piled into the Carolinas knocking down trees, and gorging rivers and causing major power outages before it was downgraded to a tropical storm.
STORM SURGE WARNINGS
Some 105,000 people were staying in temporary shelters after mass evacuation of coastal areas of the Philippines following major storm surge warnings.
Authorities in some areas of northern Luzon turned off power as a precaution, and said some residents in high-risk areas chose to ride out the storm to protect homes from looters. 
More than 1,000 houses were impacted in Cagayan province, where the storm first made landfall, with authorities in the town of Baggao saying they had lost contact with an emergency response team, said Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana.
Rogelio Sending, a government official in Cagayan said there were province-wide power and communication outages and reports of uprooted trees blocking roads.
""This makes the clearing operations really difficult,"" he said by phone.
The Philippines is still haunted by the devastation of Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,300 people in central areas of the country in 2013, most due to huge storm surges.
But authorities say they were better prepared this time in terms of evacuating and informing high-risk communities.
""I talked to the president last night. His clear and concise marching order was 'Save lives, save lives,'"" said Francis Tolentino, the government's disaster response coordinator and adviser to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte.
Renato Solidum, a senior official at the Science and Technology department, said people in northern Luzon experienced a super typhoon in 2016 and were not caught off guard. 
""There has been an aggressive information dissemination to prepare well,"" he said.
""Because the people had experienced a super typhoon only recently, they really had imagination about what happened before and that they really need to be prepared.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Gunmen with rifles and pistols killed three people on Friday and injured at least seven in a tourist plaza in downtown Mexico City, police said, adding that they were chasing three men dressed as mariachi musicians who fled on motorbikes.
After years of keeping a lid on the worst violent crime that has plagued Mexico, its capital has seen homicides surge since 2014 to record levels, presenting a major challenge to an incoming city government that has vowed a clean-up.
In a statement, police said the three victims were killed at an intersection on the edge of Plaza Garibaldi, a major tourist destination packed with mariachi bars, just as the capital was kicking off independence day weekend celebrations.
The victims had been at a restaurant when the shooting started around 10 p.m., media said, adding that forensic officials had counted more than 60 bullet cases at the scene.
""People were screaming and running,"" said a disabled woman who sells cigarettes in Garibaldi, shortly after having heard what she thought were fireworks. She declined to be identified. 
The identity of the three dead was not immediately clear, but the Milenio newspaper said they were men. Another newspaper said two of the injured were women.
Four of the injured were hurt as the gunmen fled, Mexico City police chief Raymundo Collins told reporters.
""Nothing like this has ever happened before,"" said Samuel, a man who added that he had worked for thirty years around the square in one of the world's biggest, most populous cities, but declined to give his last name.
Videos on social media and television showed a heavy police presence, with the attack site cordoned off and yellow markers where the bullet casings fell, but dozens of people continued to drink and listen to live music nearby.
Police blame much of the capital's crime on retail drug dealing and protection rackets run by violent gangs, though the government says at least one of these has links to a major national trafficking group, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.
Plaza Garibaldi borders one of Mexico City's most notorious neighborhoods, Tepito, home to La Union gang police say is behind a spurt in drug-dealing and protection rackets. 
In August, police arrested the presumed leader of the gang, Roberto Moyado Esparza ""El Betito"". Since then, the Tepito neighborhood has suffered a wave of violence, including several killings.
Garibaldi, on the edge of the touristy, colonial historic center of Mexico City, is known for seedy strip clubs and dive bars, aside from mariachis.

In 2013, U.S. civil rights leader Malcolm X's grandson, Malcolm Shabazz, was beaten to death near the square after a dispute over a nightclub bill.

Leftist Funes, who governed El Salvador between 2009 and 2014 and is currently in Nicaragua, is accused of embezzlement and money laundering involving $351 million, the prosecutors' office said. 
Earlier this week the attorney general's office won a case against former President Antonio Saca, who pleaded guilty to similar charges.
Instead of opting for an internationally-backed anti-corruption body like the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), El Salvador has said that its own institutions are capable of bringing corrupt politicians to justice. 
The prosecutors said they presented a request on Thursday to the San Salvador tribunal for the extradition of Funes, his partner and two of his sons.
They allege that Funes used public money to pay for credit cards, trips, home refurbishments, vehicles and hospital bills.
Funes said on Friday on Twitter that the request was just ""a publicity stunt."" He has said he is a victim of political attacks orchestrated by businessmen and conservatives.

Funes, a 59-year old former journalist, has been in Nicaragua since September 2016. He governed under the banner of the left-wing Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) party, which is still in power.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, in intensive care after being stabbed at a campaign rally, kept his first-round lead in an election opinion poll on Friday, but a leftist rival from the Workers Party (PT) made solid gains.
Bolsonaro was backed by 26 percent of those surveyed, up two percentage points from the same poll published earlier this week, according to the Datafolha survey published by the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper.
The knife attack against Bolsonaro last week has further complicated Brazil's most unpredictable election in three decades, with its most popular politician, jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, banned from running in the Oct. 7 vote due to a corruption conviction. 
Lula's hand-picked successor to stand for the PT is former Sao Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad, who jumped to 13 percent of support in Friday's poll, up 4 points.
The poll indicates the PT's strategy of transferring Lula's massive appeal to the relatively unknown Haddad is bearing fruit. The party's campaign rolled out advertising this week with the simple message: ""Haddad is Lula."" 
Lula's backing is expected to propel Haddad into a likely Oct. 28 runoff vote, required if no candidate takes a majority in the first ballot. 
The Datafolha poll showed that Bolsonaro, who has spent nearly three decades in Congress, and Haddad would be technically tied in a simulated second-round vote. 
Bolsonaro would lose to all other major candidates in a runoff, the survey found. A former army captain who favors easing gun control laws to fight crime, Bolsonaro has enraged many Brazilians with comments denigrating women, gays, blacks and indigenous people.
He has led the field from the outset in polls that excluded Lula, tapping into voter anger over political corruption. 
But the polarizing nature of Bolsonaro means he has the highest rejection rate of all contenders, holding even at 44 percent on Friday. Haddad's rejection rate is 26 percent, up 4 percentage points from Monday.
Support for center-left candidate Ciro Gomes, a former governor of Ceará state in Brazil's poor northeast, stayed even at 13 percent.
Business-friendly candidate Geraldo Alckmin saw his campaign continue to stagnate, with the poll indicating support of 9 percent. Environmentalist Marina Silva fell 3 percentage points to 8 percent.

Datafolha interviewed 2,820 people across Brazil on Thursday and Friday for the survey, which has a 2 percentage point margin of error.

(Reuters) - A plea deal by former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors in their investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election suggests he could shed light on unanswered questions revolving around the campaign, legal experts said on Friday.
Manafort's agreement with Special Counsel Robert Mueller to cooperate ""fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly"" could put to the test U.S. President Donald Trump's denials of campaign collusion with Russia, lawyers not involved in the case said.
Randall Eliason, a former federal prosecutor and a law professor at George Washington University, said the agreement, which caps at 10 years a sentence which could have been much longer, was a ""pretty good deal"" that suggested the Mueller team valued Manafort's cooperation.
Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is representing Trump in the Russia probe, told Reuters on Friday that Manafort ""knows nothing harmful to the president and the plea is the best evidence of that."" The White House said in a statement that the agreement had ""absolutely nothing to do"" with the president or his 2016 campaign.
Manafort attended a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Russian representatives and top campaign officials, including Trump's son and son-in-law, who expected to receive derogatory information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
Any light Manafort could shed on that meeting and other episodes could deepen the Mueller probe, legal experts said, increasing the pressure on Trump. The president and his allies have repeatedly called for the investigation to wind down and he describes the probe as a ""witch hunt."" 
Donald Trump Jr, who organized the meeting with Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and others, initially said it was mainly to discuss a program on adoptions of Russian children. The president has since acknowledged the meeting was set up to find out damaging information about Clinton but that it was ""totally legal and done all the time in politics.""
Moscow rejects the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that it interfered in the election by hacking Democratic Party computer networks and spreading disinformation on social media. 
Some legal experts said that if Trump and his advisers knowingly solicited help from Russia, they may have violated campaign finance laws, and a statute that criminalizes conspiracies to impair the functioning of the U.S. government.
Mueller's investigators might also be looking to Manafort to learn whether the Trump team offered anything to the Russians in exchange for campaign help, said Seth Waxman, a former federal prosecutor.
Manafort's deal could also prompt other subjects of Mueller's investigation to cooperate, causing ""the proverbial snowball to roll down the hill,"" Waxman said.
Other issues Manafort could be questioned about are his longstanding business and personal ties with Trump ally Roger Stone. Stone's communications have been a subject of the Mueller investigation, sources familiar with interviews of other Stone associates have said.
Manafort oversaw the 2016 Republican National Convention in which the party’s platform on Ukraine was altered in a way that made it more in line with Russian interests. Manafort represented pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine before his stint on the Trump campaign.
The structure of Manafort's plea deal limits the effectiveness of any Trump pardon, said Jed Shugerman, a law professor at Fordham University. Manafort admitted to conduct chargeable as state crimes, to which a presidential pardon do not apply.

Manafort refused for months to assist Mueller’s inquiry before admitting guilt to criminal charges that he concealed money from tax authorities.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Russia on Friday of actively working to undermine international sanctions on North Korea and said the enforcement of the steps was essential to convince Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons.
""Russia has actively attempted to undermine the U.N. Security Council resolutions, the work of the ... committee at the U.N. that evaluates compliance with sanctions,"" Pompeo told a news briefing at the State Department.
Pompeo spoke after U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley accused Moscow on Thursday of seeking to cover up breaches of U.N. sanctions on North Korea by Russians by pushing for changes to an independent report on sanctions violations.
Pompeo said he hoped the U.N. sanctions committee would ""publish the original document that they intended to publish which shows clear activities related to sanctions and sanctions violations."" 
""The United States is as committed as ever to continuing to enforce those U.N. Security Council resolutions. We believe they are central to President Trump’s efforts to convince Chairman Kim that full, final denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is necessary,"" he said. 
Pompeo added that the United States was continuing to have ""many conversations"" with the North Koreans about ""how to effectuate achieving all of the commitments made"" at a June 12 summit between Trump and Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader.
The Russian U.N. mission and the North Korean U.N. mission did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Pompeo’s remarks. 
The U.N. Security Council will meet on Monday over the implementation of sanctions on North Korea at the request of Washington. 
The report submitted to the Security Council's North Korea sanctions committee last month said Pyongyang had not stopped its nuclear and missile programs and was violating U.N. sanctions on exports.
Diplomats said Russia pressured the independent sanctions monitors to amend the report. One diplomat said the amended report removed some references to Russians accused of breaching sanctions on North Korea.
The Security Council has to agree by consensus on whether to publish the report and the United States objected to releasing the amended document. 
Russia and China have suggested the Security Council discuss easing sanctions after the Trump-Kim summit, while Washington and other council members have said there must be strict enforcement of sanctions until Pyongyang acts. 

On Thursday, Washington imposed sanctions on a China-based technology firm, its North Korean chief executive and a Russian subsidiary, accusing them of moving illicit funding to North Korea in violation of U.S. sanctions.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia's ruling Nidaa Tounes party said on Friday it had frozen the prime minister's membership in the latest escalation in a row between the prime minister and the president's son.
Prime Minister Youssef Chahed said in May that the president's son, Hafedh Caid Essebsi, had destroyed the ruling Nidaa Tounes party and that the crisis in the party has affected state institutions.
""The party decided to freeze the membership of Chahed"", Nidaa Tounes said in a statement.
The president's son, who is the leader of Nidaa Tounes, had called for the prime minister's dismissal because of his government's failure to revive the economy. His call was supported by the powerful UGTT union, which rejected economic reforms proposed by the prime minister.
But the moderate Islamist party Ennahda rejected calls to dismiss Chahed and said the exit of the prime minister would hit stability at a time when the country needed economic reforms.
""Despite the lack of political support for the government, we will move ahead with economic reforms next year, including the reform of subsidies and social funds,"" Chahed said on Friday.
In July, president Beji Caid Essebsi called Chahed to step down or seek a confidence vote if the country’s political and economic crisis continues, withdrawing his support for the premier.
The North African country has been hailed as the Arab Spring's only democratic success because protests toppled autocrat Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011 without triggering the kind of violent upheavals seen in Syria and Libya.

But since 2011, nine cabinets have failed to resolve Tunisia's economic problems, which include high inflation and unemployment, and impatience is rising among lenders such as the International Monetary Fund, which have kept the country afloat.

Venezuela launched the program last month after hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans migrated across the region to escape hyperinflation and food shortages at home. 
So far, Venezuela has flown 2,866 Venezuelans back from South American countries, including 190 on two flights from Peru, according to Venezuela's embassy in Lima.
But Eduardo Sevilla, Peru's Superintendent of Migrations, said the program has had no noticeable effect on the Venezuelan population in Peru that has risen to some 437,000 and swells with an average of 1,300 new arrivals every day.
""In one day, six times as many Venezuelans enter Peru than those who have been repatriated,"" Sevilla said in an interview. ""There'd have to be no fewer than 45 flights every week from Lima to Caracas for those who want to leave to come close to those who want to enter.""
Migration is the latest issue on which Maduro's government has adopted a radically different stance from international organizations and most other large countries in the region.
The United Nations' migration agency, which estimates more than 1.6 million Venezuelans have left their country since 2015, has warned the exodus is nearing a ""crisis moment"" comparable to refugees in the Mediterranean.
But Maduro has denied the mass exodus and the crippling economic crisis driving it, saying that while some Venezuelans have been tempted to ""try their luck"" abroad, the vast majority end up regretting it.
Maduro said last week that no more than 600,000 Venezuelans have left the country in the past two years. 
But Sevilla said more than 600,00 Venezuelans have applied for residency cards in Peru and Colombia alone. ""It's a free and voluntary process,"" he said. ""These aren't made-up figures. They're people who exist with first and last names.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday lambasted his predecessor, John Kerry, for meetings with Iranian officials in back-channel talks and accused him of ""actively undermining"" the Trump administration's policy toward Tehran.
""What Secretary Kerry has done is unseemly and unprecedented,"" Pompeo told a news conference, adding that he ""ought not to engage in that kind of behavior. It's inconsistent with what the foreign policy of the United States is, as directed by this president. It is beyond inappropriate.""
Pompeo's sharp criticism of Kerry comes a day after President Donald Trump accused the former secretary of state of ""illegal"" meetings on Iran in a late-night tweet.
""John Kerry had illegal meetings with the very hostile Iranian Regime, which can only serve to undercut our great work to the detriment of the American people. He told them to wait out the Trump Administration! Was he registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act? BAD!"" Trump said on Twitter.
Trump withdrew the United States from a nuclear deal that Kerry clinched in 2015 between Iran and six world powers. The Trump administration has pushed a hard line against Tehran, which it accuses of expanding its influence in the Middle East through support for proxy armed groups in countries such as Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.
Kerry, in a radio interview with Fox News as part of a book tour, said he had met with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif ""three or four times"" since the end of his term in January 2017. He has also accused the Trump administration of pursuing a policy of regime change in Iran.
""Mr. President, you should be more worried about Paul Manafort meeting with Robert Mueller than me meeting with Iran's FM,"" Kerry said on Twitter shortly after Pompeo's remarks, referring to Trump's former campaign chairman who on Friday agreed to cooperate with federal investigators into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.
""There’s nothing unusual, let alone unseemly or inappropriate, about former diplomats meeting with foreign counterparts,"" a spokesman for Kerry said in a statement. ""What is unseemly and unprecedented is for the podium of the State Department to be hijacked for political theatrics,"" he said.
During interviews this week Kerry has accused the Trump administration of pursuing a policy of regime change in Iran.
Pompeo pushed back, saying that was not the administration's intention.

""This is a former secretary of state engaged with the world's largest state sponsor of terror ...,"" Pompeo said, adding: ""He was telling them to wait out this administration. You can't find precedent for this in U.S. history.""

1160,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 06:16PM ET</span>","Trump ex-campaign head Manafort changes mind, cooperates in Russia probe","By Nathan Layne, Jonathan Landay and Karen Freifeld
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort will cooperate with the federal investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, a dramatic turnaround in a probe that the U.S. president derides as a political witch hunt.
After months of refusing to assist Special Counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into Russian interference and possible coordination between Trump campaign members and Moscow, Manafort finally took a plea deal on Friday and agreed to cooperate in return for reduced charges. Trump had previously praised Manafort in an Aug. 22 Twitter post as ""a brave man"" for his refusal to cooperate with the inquiry. 
It is unclear what information Manafort, a longtime Republican political consultant who ran the campaign as it took off in mid-2016, could offer prosecutors but his cooperation might bring Trump, his family and associates under closer scrutiny.
The White House distanced Trump from the man who helped get him elected in November 2016 against the odds in a bitterly contested campaign in which he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.
""This had absolutely nothing to do with the president or his victorious 2016 presidential campaign,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement. ""It is totally unrelated."" 
Cornell University professor of law Jens David Ohlin said it was hard to predict what information a cooperation agreement will yield but that Manafort's deal could be a serious problem for Trump. 
""If Manafort is willing to give Mueller information about Trump's contacts with Russia, whether the contacts were direct or indirect, then this really is a disaster for Trump and his associates.""
Manafort is the fifth person linked to Trump to plead guilty to criminal charges. The others are his former longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen, former campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, Trump's first national security adviser Michael Flynn and Manafort's business protege Rick Gates, who also worked on the 2016 campaign.
Manafort, 69, pleaded guilty in a federal court in Washington on Friday to conspiracy against the United States - a charge that includes a range of conduct from money laundering to unregistered lobbying - and conspiracy to obstruct justice for his attempts to tamper with witnesses in his case. The prosecution dropped five other counts. 
The plea, coming on the heels of a conviction in a separate case last month, concludes a steep fall from grace for a multi-millionaire who was often at Trump's side as he took U.S. politics by storm in 2016. The investigation has cast a shadow over the president as the leader of the Republican Party going into the Nov. 6 congressional elections that will determine whether or not Republicans keep control of Congress.
Mueller’s team told the court that Manafort had previewed what information he could offer, leading to the deal. The plea agreement requires him to cooperate completely with the government, including giving interviews without his attorney present and testifying before any grand juries or at any trials. 
Manafort is facing up to 10 years in prison on the two charges in Washington alone, and another eight to 10 years on a conviction in Virginia in August on tax and bank fraud charges. 
But depending on the extent of his cooperation and the degree to which prosecutors argue for reducing his sentence, Manafort could end up getting anywhere from a year to five years in prison, according to Mark Allenbaugh, a federal sentencing expert. “It would not surprise me if he got time served for both cases,” Allenbaugh said.
Manafort was convicted last month in Virginia on charges that pre-dated his stint on the Trump campaign and involved his work with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. The jury found that he hid from U.S. tax authorities $16 million he earned as a political consultant in Ukraine to fund an opulent lifestyle and lied to banks to secure $20 million in loans. 
TURNAROUND
In court on Friday, Manafort stood stock still before the judge, answering her questions with single words in a low tone, or sat at the defense table. He sat straight or leaned his chin on his right hand throughout a lengthy recital of the charges to which he pleaded guilty. 
Manafort made millions of dollars working in Ukraine before taking an unpaid position with Trump's campaign for five months. 
Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is representing Trump in the Russia probe, said Manafort cooperating with Mueller was not a problem for his client.
""He knows nothing harmful to the president and the plea is the best evidence of that,"" Giuliani told Reuters. 
Manafort was present at a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer at which his son expected to receive possibly damaging information about election opponent Clinton. Trump's critics have pointed to the meeting as evidence of the collusion with Russia that Trump denies. 
Later in 2016, Manafort oversaw the Republican National Convention that nominated Trump for the presidency. During the convention, the party’s platform on Ukraine was altered in a way that made it more in line with Russian interests.
Trump has the power to issue a presidential pardon for Manafort on federal charges. The president has not said whether he would do so.
Senator Mark Warner, the leading Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, said any attempt by Trump to pardon Manafort ""would be a gross abuse of power and require immediate action by Congress."" 
Prosecutor Andrew Weissmann walked the court through Manafort’s efforts over a decade to influence power brokers in Washington without acknowledging that he was being paid tens of millions of dollars from pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, a disclosure required by law. 
“Mr. Manafort engaged in a variety of criminal schemes. He did so knowingly, intentionally and willfully,” Weissmann said.
The plea agreement requires Manafort to forfeit millions of dollars worth of real estate, including a mansion in the Hamptons, a Brooklyn brownstone and an apartment in Trump Tower in Manhattan.

“He’s accepted responsibility,"" Manafort's lawyer Kevin Downing said outside the courthouse.""He wanted to make sure that his family was able to remain safe and live a good life.""

CARACAS (Reuters) - Two Venezuelan firefighters were detained by military officers this week as suspects behind the making of a viral video that mocked unpopular President Nicolas Maduro by likening him to a donkey touring a fire station, two rights groups said on Friday.
Government critics, who say former bus driver and union leader Maduro is to blame for oil-rich Venezuela's brutal five-year recession, have long nicknamed him ""Maburro,"" a play on the Spanish word for donkey, ""burro.""
The video showed a man using a rope to lead a donkey through a fire station in the Andean state of Merida. A narrator feigns guiding the president on an official visit in a style that seemed to make fun of fawning coverage on state television.
""Good evening comrades, as you can see we are receiving the visit of President Maduro. He is doing an inspection,"" the man filming says in the video, as the donkey slowly walks through a dimly lit, spartan fire station.
As the donkey chews on a verdant patch overlooking a valley, the narrator says, ""He is checking whether the grass is in a good state or not.""
""He is indicating that the grass is good - that is the only good thing we have here at the station,"" the narrator says, alluding to the recession. ""Now go to the bathroom, so you can see the conditions. Or the kitchen.""
Members of Venezuela's military counterintelligence unit DGCIM arrested the two firemen, Carlos Baron and Ricardo Prieto, on Wednesday, according to rights group Espacio Publico. But a human rights observatory that is part of the University of the Andes in Merida said the arrests were on Thursday.
""We know the DGCIM took them away, but we do not know where they are,"" Mary Isabel Rodriguez of Espacio Publico said on Friday.
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Baron and Prieto could not be reached.
Opposition politicians say Maduro has morphed into a dictator by arresting rivals and cracking down on dissent. Maduro says he is facing an armed uprising backed by his foe the United States.

Driven by Lopez Obrador's leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), the lower house of Congress late on Thursday passed a law that will cap all salaries for officials at the president's wage or below.
Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Dec. 1, won a landslide victory in July after pledging to save billions of dollars through anti-corruption and austerity measures to fund scholarships for students, pensions for the elderly and infrastructure projects in Mexico's poor south.
MORENA and its allies have a majority in both houses and made passing the salary bill their first legislative priority since the new Congress began in September.
""We're going to lower the salaries of those on top because this way we can save in order to attend to the demands of justice,"" Lopez Obrador said at a town hall-style meeting on security in Mexico City.
Lopez Obrador vowed to cut his own salary to 40 percent of what outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto earns to 108,000 pesos ($5,718) per month - a sum well below many high-paying government jobs in the current administration.
He has also promised to waive his bodyguards and sell the presidential jet as well as a fleet of government aircraft. New lawmakers are also making a show of cutting spending.
Earlier this week, the new head of the Senate, MORENA's Marti Batres, launched a ""Tupperware Challenge"" on social media, where he asked lawmakers to bring their own lunch rather than take advantage of government-funded meals at their offices. 
Some opposition lawmakers ridiculed the move as a populist stunt.
Local media have reported the cuts could hit around 35,000 officials currently earning more than Lopez Obrador's proposed wage.
Lawmakers from smaller parties warned the move could lead to an exodus of officials from well-paid technical jobs in key ministries such as communications, energy and finance.
A bill stipulating that no public sector worker should earn more than the president was approved by the Senate seven years ago, but was not taken up under Pena Nieto's administration.
On Friday, Lopez Obrador also said the bill would allow him to fulfill another campaign promise - to end generous pensions enjoyed by former Mexican presidents.

GAZA (Reuters) - Israeli soldiers killed three Palestinians, one of them an 11-year-old boy, and wounded at least 248 others taking part on Friday in weekly protests at the fortified Gaza Strip border, Palestinian medical officials said. 
The Israeli military said it used force necessary to repel 13,000 Palestinians who massed at several points at the fence. 
Some hurled rocks, fire-bombs and grenades at troops under cover of smoke from burning tyres, injuring a soldier, and nine Palestinians briefly crossed into Israel, the military said.
Friday's dead brought to 177 the number of Palestinians killed since the sometimes violent demonstrations were launched on March 30 to press demands against Israel. The 11-year-old, Shadi Abdel-Al, is the youngest fatality from Israeli gunfire.
""He used to go every Friday to the marches like thousands of other people. This Friday was his destiny to die as a martyr,"" the boy's father, Abdel-Aziz Abdel-Al, told Reuters.
Another Palestinian, 28-year-old Hashem Hassan, said he saw Abdel-Al being shot 70 meters (yards) from the fence: ""He threw a few stones, which flew just a few yards. He posed no threat.""
Asked about Abdel-Al's death, a military spokeswoman said only that troops had kept to their open-fire regulations.
Since March 30, Gaza has also seen shelling exchanges between the coastal enclave's Islamist Hamas rulers and Israel. An Israeli soldier was killed by a Palestinian sniper and Israel has lost tracts of forest and farmland to cross-border incendiary attacks.
Israel's tactics against the protests have drawn international condemnation.
But Washington has backed its ally in accusing Hamas of staging the mass-mobilization to distract from Gaza's poverty and governance problems and to provide cover for armed Palestinian border incursions. Hamas has denied this.
The Israeli military said that, twice this week, its patrols discovered and dismantled bombs that had been planted for use against them at the fence. Early on Friday, several Palestinians crawled to the fence to throw a pipebomb at troops, who fired back, the military said. There was no word of casualties. 
The protesters want rights to lands Palestinians lost during the 1948 war of Israel's foundation, as well as the easing of a crippling blockade that Israel, with the help of neighboring Egypt, has placed on Gaza to isolate Hamas and deny it weaponry. 

U.N. and Egyptian mediators have been trying to reach a deal to calm Gaza, where Israel and Hamas have fought three wars in the last decade. The brokering efforts have been complicated by Hamas's feuding with Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who has restricted funding to Gaza.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and the European Union are ""closing in"" on a withdrawal agreement, Brexit minister Dominic Raab said on Friday, before a meeting of European leaders in Salzburg next week.
Britain is due to leave the bloc on March 29 but has yet to reach a full exit deal with Brussels, and some rebels lawmakers in Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party have threatened to vote against any agreement unless she changes her proposals.
Both London and Brussels are hoping to reach a deal by mid-November. May has said next week's informal EU summit will be a ""staging post"" in the negotiations that will allow the bloc's leaders to discuss her Brexit plans for the first time.
""While there remain some substantive differences we need to resolve, it is clear our teams are closing in on workable solutions to the outstanding issues in the Withdrawal Agreement, and are having productive discussions in the right spirit on the future relationship,"" Raab said after a phone call with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.
""We reiterated our willingness to devote the necessary time and energy to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion,"" he said, adding that the pair agreed to take stock again following the Salzburg summit.
Barnier said on Twitter that he had had a ""useful dialogue"" with Raab but that key differences remained between the EU and Britain over the future of the Irish border and the EU's system of protecting food names.
EU officials and diplomats involved in the talks also expressed surprise about the apparent optimism in financial markets on the likelihood of a deal.
OPPOSITION
On Thursday the British government published a set of advice notices for Britons on how to prepare for the possibility of a ""no-deal"" Brexit, and May held a cabinet meeting of her top team of ministers to discuss the government's plans for leaving without an agreement.
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney told the meeting Britain's property market would crash and mortgage rates would spiral up in the event of a chaotic no-deal Brexit, with house prices falling 35 percent over three years, the Times newspaper reported.
The Co-Operative, Britain's sixth-largest supermarket group, said it could not guarantee shortages of some food products would be avoided in the event of a no-deal Brexit. 
However, Carney also told the cabinet meeting that Britain could expect a 16 billion pound boost if there was a deal struck based on May's so-called Chequers proposals which involve a common rule book for goods trade with the bloc, the Financial Times reported.
""Carney said that we would recover three-quarters of the growth lost after the 2016 referendum because Chequers would imply more access to the European market than under current assumptions,"" an unnamed cabinet source told the FT.
Pro-Brexit rebels in May's party have become increasingly vocal in their opposition to her Brexit proposals this week, with one former junior minister saying 80 or more of May's lawmakers were prepared to vote against them.

The opposition Labour Party's foreign affairs spokeswoman Emily Thornberry told the Financial Times her party was set to vote against any Brexit deal and the lack of a viable exit from the EU would force May from office before Christmas.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Orthodox Church said on Friday it would no longer participate in structures chaired by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, deepening a row in Orthodox Christianity over the Ukrainian Church's bid to break away from Moscow's orbit. 
The Russian Orthodox Church's Holy Synod ruling body convened on Friday to consider how to respond as the Ukrainian Orthodox Church has courted Constantinople to formally make it a self-governing body independent of Moscow. 
Ukraine's pro-Western political leaders have sought step by step to take the former Soviet republic out of Moscow's orbit after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and a Moscow-backed insurgency broke out in eastern Ukraine.
Vladimir Legoida, a Russian Church spokesman, said the Holy Synod had decided to suspend its participation in all structures chaired or co-chaired by representatives of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. 
It is also suspending all services with top priests of the Patriarchate of Constantinople and will not commemorate the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I in its services, Legoida wrote on social media, summarizing the outcome of the meeting. 
""Essentially this is a breakdown of relations. To take an example from secular life, the decision is roughly equivalent to cutting diplomatic ties,"" the Russian Church's Metropolitan Ilarion was quoted by RIA news agency as saying. 
RIVAL CHURCHES
The Moscow Patriarchate is part of the Russian Orthodox Church and has a sizeable following in Ukraine. 
Kiev considers it a tool for the Kremlin to wield influence, while the Moscow Patriarchate sees itself as the only legitimate Orthodox Church in Ukraine. 
The Kremlin said it was following the situation closely and opposed any split in Orthodoxy, adding that the state should not intervene in church matters. 
""Of course for Moscow and indeed for the entire Orthodox world the single preferable scenario is the preservation of unity of this Orthodox world,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call. 
The Moscow Patriarchate vies for influence in Ukraine with the Kiev Patriarchate - a branch of the Orthodox Church that broke away from Moscow in 1992 after the fall of the Soviet Union - and with other Orthodox and Catholic denominations.
The Kiev Patriarchate's leader has been sharply critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin and in 2014 suggested he was possessed by Satan.
The Ecumenical Patriarch does not wield the power enjoyed by the Pope in the Roman Catholic Church but is traditionally regarded as the 'first among equals' among the patriarchs of the self-governing Orthodox churches and also as the spiritual leader of the roughly 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide.
The Ecumenical Patriarch, currently Bartholomew, also holds the title of Archbishop of Constantinople, the old Greek name for Istanbul, Turkey's largest city. The city fell to the Muslim Turks in 1453 but has remained the historic seat of Orthodoxy.

However Russia has long been home to the world's largest Orthodox Christian Church.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo's state prosecutor indicted 12 people including senior government officials on charges of pensions fraud on Friday, accusing them of falsely registering thousands of people as war veterans who claimed millions of euros in state benefits.
Around 40,000 people in Kosovo are drawing state pensions for war veterans, but the prosecution says half of them never fought in the 1998-99 war for independence with Serbia.
Public prosecutor Aleksander Lumezi told Reuters that among those indicted is Rrustem Berisha, minister for Kosovo's Security Forces and his deputy Agim Ceku. 
Ceku served as prime minister from 2006 to 2008.
""From the evidences that we have gathered so far it has been proven that from the unlawful payments for veterans the budget was damaged in the amount of 68 million euros,"" the state prosecutor's office said in a statement.
Ceku also heads the commission which evaluates war veterans' pensions applications. He declined to comment on the charges.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has long warned that Kosovo's war veterans' pension scheme would come to be a major burden on its budget.
Ceku and most of Kosovo's political elite served high up in the Kosovo Liberation Army during the war and are held in high esteem by Kosovars, making any investigation difficult. 
One prosecutor on the case left Kosovo for the United States saying he had been receiving threats to quit. This drew criticism from Washington and the European Union. 
""Pension fraud indictment filed, proud of Kosovo for taking this important step to fight corruption,"" the U.S. Ambassador in Pristina, Greg Delawie, wrote on Twitter.
Kosovo, which has a population of 1.8 million and is mainly ethnic Albanian, declared independence from Belgrade in 2008, almost a decade after NATO air strikes ousted Serbian forces and halted a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in a counter-insurgency.

1169,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>","Austria, Italy propose holding migrants on ships for days","VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria and Italy's far-right interior ministers suggested on Friday that the European Union hold migrants rescued at sea on ships for days while an initial screening of their chances of obtaining asylum is carried out.
Far-right parties like Italy's League and Austria's Freedom Party have long pushed for a system where migrants rescued while attempting the dangerous Mediterranean crossing be taken back to Africa rather than brought to Europe, where they can stay while their asylum claims are processed.
""For those who manage to make it into a European state's territorial waters and are then picked up by a ship, we should use the ships to carry out the appropriate checks on whether they deserve protection,"" Austrian Interior Minister Herbert Kickl told a joint news conference in Vienna with his visiting Italian counterpart.
Italy has become the main route into Europe for hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers arriving by sea since the other main route from Turkey to Greece was largely shut in 2016. Although numbers have dropped over the past year, Italy's new populist government has made shutting down the route a policy priority.
Migration dominated last year's parliamentary election in Austria, which took in more than 1 percent of its population in asylum seekers in 2015. The conservative-led government has pledged to prevent another such influx, even if that means restricting border crossings from Italy.
Kickl's suggestion was aimed at offering an alternative to a proposal for ""regional disembarkation platforms"" at Mediterranean ports from where arrivals would be spread around the EU - a proposal that seems unlikely to be put into effect.
""You are well looked after on a ship,"" Kickl said at a migration conference he hosted, adding that after a screening that ""should last a few days"" those with no chance of asylum should be denied access to Europe.
His Italian counterpart Matteo Salvini said he backed the idea. Prosecutors in Sicily last week formally told Salvini that he was under investigation for ""illegal confinement"" following his refusal to let more than 100 rescued migrants disembark from an Italian coastguard ship.
The group were held on board for 10 days before Salvini finally allowed them off after Ireland, Albania and the Italian Catholic church agreed to take most of them in.
""I'm absolutely in favor. In fact, I was saying how ironic it was that having held a group of immigrants on a ship in an Italian port for 10 days, an Italian judge placed me under investigation for kidnapping,"" said Salvini, who is also deputy prime minister and heads the League party.
Separately, Salvini denied having reached a deal with Germany to take back migrants who had already applied for asylum in Italy, saying he wanted more concessions from Berlin. 
He also likened African immigrants to slaves during a migration conference in Vienna, drawing an angry response from Luxembourg's foreign minister, who cursed at him in frustration.

ISTANBUL/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Turkey said on Friday it was talking to all parties in the Syrian conflict to prevent a government offensive on Idlib ahead of talks between Russian and Turkish leaders, who support rival sides in the looming battle for the rebel-held region.
Ankara failed last week to win agreement for a ceasefire from Russia and Iran, President Bashar al-Assad's main backers, but there has been a recent lull in air strikes and a pro-Damascus source indicated a ground attack may not be imminent. 
Rebels also said some pro-Assad forces had left frontlines in northwest Syria in recent days.
Turkey has reinforced a dozen military posts inside the Idlib region, which lies across its southern border and is controlled by Turkey-backed rebels and jihadist fighters, trying to forestall a government assault.
Chief of Staff Yasar Guler visited military positions on the border and was briefed by commanders stationed in the Idlib region, Turkey's armed forces said.
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey had also contacted foreign ministers of several countries and was in touch with ""all actors in Syria"".
""We are making an effort for a ceasefire in Idlib,"" he said, repeating Turkey's call for targeted operations against jihadist militants, including the Tahrir al-Sham alliance, instead of an indiscriminate onslaught.
""We are ready to cooperate with everyone to fight terrorist organizations. But killing everyone – civilians, women, children – like this in the name of fighting terrorist organizations is not right and is not humane,"" he said on a visit to Pakistan.

The United Nations has warned that an offensive in Idlib could trigger a humanitarian catastrophe in an area where 3 million people live. Turkey, already hosting 3.5 million Syrians, says it cannot take in another wave of refugees.
RUSSIA TALKS
Turkish presidential aide Ibrahim Kalin said after talks with Russian, German and French officials in Istanbul that they agreed the consequences of an attack on Idlib would be severe and a refugee wave would impact not just Turkey but Europe too.
""Our expectation is to maintain the current status in Idlib, protecting the civilians and not creating a humanitarian crisis,"" Kalin told reporters.
President Tayyip Erdogan will hold talks in Russia on Monday with President Vladimir Putin to discuss the Syrian crisis, 10 days after similar talks in Tehran, Turkish and Russian officials said. 
Despite the deadlock at the Iran meeting, calm has largely prevailed in northwest Syria this week following a wave of air strikes which killed several dozen people and generated speculation of an imminent ground offensive.
A pro-Assad source in Syria said: ""There is patience and repositioning currently. The operation is not canceled, but we have time.""
A second source, an official in the regional alliance that supports Assad, said there was a ""political tug of war"" over Idlib, accompanied by air strikes on militants from Tahrir al-Sham.
Two rebel sources in the northwest said some government forces have been observed withdrawing from frontlines in the Hama region, which adjoins Idlib, this week. 
""It appears that the Russians and the Assad regime have temporarily looked the other way,"" said one of the sources, Colonel Mustafa Bakour, a commander in the Jaish al-Ezza rebel group. He added that several hundred pro-Assad forces had withdrawn from frontlines in the northern Hama countryside.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said calm mostly prevailed again on Friday.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Moscow would keep bombing militant targets in Idlib if need be, but would also open humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to flee, the Interfax news agency reported. 
Lavrov, who was speaking in Berlin, was cited as saying that the Russian air force would strike what he called terrorist weapons-making facilities as and when it found out about them, but would also encourage local reconciliation deals.
Kalin said it was too soon to talk about humanitarian corridors until attacks in Idlib were halted.

Putin also discussed the situation Idlib with members of Russia's Security Council on Friday, telling them he was concerned by militant activity there, the RIA news agency cited the Kremlin as saying.

WILMINGTON, N.C. (Reuters) - Hurricane Florence crashed into the Carolinas on Friday with 90-mph (144 kph) winds, torrential rains and a powerful storm surge before slowing to a pace that meant it would plague the area with days of flooding.
The hurricane's storm surge - the wall of water it pushed in from the Atlantic - had ""overwhelmed"" New Bern, a town of about 30,000 people next to the Neuse River, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said.
""The sun rose this morning on an extremely dangerous situation and it's going to get worse,"" he said at a news conference in Raleigh. ""To those in the storm's path, if you can hear me, please stay sheltered in place.""
Cooper said Florence would ""continue its violent grind across the state for days.""
No storm-related deaths or serious injuries were reported in the hours immediately after Florence hit but authorities said more than 60 people, including many children and pets, had to be evacuated from a hotel in Jacksonville, North Carolina, after strong winds caused parts of the roof to collapse.
The center of the hurricane's eye came ashore at about 7:15 a.m. EDT (1115 GMT) near Wrightsville Beach close to Wilmington, North Carolina, with sustained winds of 90 miles per hour (150 kph), the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.
By 11 a.m. (1500 GMT) the winds had dropped to 80 mph and the center was about 5 miles (3.1 km) inland, 20 miles (30 km) southwest of Wilmington, and moving west at a sluggish 3 mph (5 kph).
Cooper said Florence was set to cover almost all of the state in several feet of water. As of Friday morning, Atlantic Beach, a town on North Carolina's Outer Banks barrier island chain, already had received 30 inches (76 cm) of rain, the U.S. Geological Service said.
National Weather Service forecaster Brandon Locklear predicted Florence would drop up to eight months' worth of rain in two or three days.
Authorities in New Bern said more than 100 people had to be saved from floods and that the downtown area was underwater. The town's public information officer, Colleen Roberts, told CNN 150 more people were awaiting rescue.
Helping with rescues there were members of the so-called Cajun Navy, a group of Louisiana-based volunteers who became famous during last year's Hurricane Harvey, locals said on Twitter.
""WE ARE COMING TO GET YOU,"" New Bern city officials said on Twitter. ""You may need to move up to the second story, or to your attic, but WE ARE COMING TO GET YOU.""
Video reports from several towns in the Carolinas showed emergency personnel wading through thigh-high water in residential neighborhoods.

'IT'S INSANE'
Florence also blew down trees, including one that went through the roof of Kevin DiLoreto's home in Wilmington. He said all roads leading to his neighborhood were blocked by fallen trees.
""It's insane,"" he said in a phone interview. ""Everybody laughs at the fact that this storm got downgraded ... but I've never seen tree devastation this bad.
""Afterwards, I'm going to drink a bottle of whiskey and take a two-day nap, but right now I'm walking the neighborhood and making sure my neighbors are fine, because nobody can get in here.""
More than 485,000 homes and businesses were without power in North and South Carolina early on Friday, utility officials said. Utility companies said millions were expected to lose power and restoration could take weeks.
Florence had been a Category 3 hurricane with 120 mph winds on Thursday but dropped to Category 1 before coming ashore. It is expected to move across parts of southeastern North Carolina and eastern South Carolina on Friday and Saturday, then head north over the western Carolinas and central Appalachian Mountains early next week, the NHC said. Significant weakening is expected over the weekend.
About 10 million people could be affected by the storm and more than 1 million were ordered to evacuate the coasts of the Carolinas and Virginia.
Some 20,000 people had taken refuge in 157 emergency shelters, Cooper said.
Maysie Baumgardner, 7, and her family sheltered at the Hotel Ballast in downtown Wilmington as the hurricane filled the streets with floodwaters.
""It looks heavy outside,"" she said. ""I'm a little bit scared right now, but I have my iPad and I'm watching Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).""

Florence was one of two major storms on Friday. In the Philippines, evacuations were under way with Super Typhoon Mangkhut expected to hit on Saturday in an area impacting an estimated 5.2 million people.

On Thursday two Russians resembling the men Britain accuses of jetting to England to try to murder Skripal said they were innocent tourists who had flown to London for fun and visited the city of Salisbury to see its cathedral.
Britain said it was clear the two men, who appeared on Russia's state-funded RT television station, were agents of Russia's GRU military intelligence who carried out the attack, and called their interview an example of ""obfuscation and lies"".
Lavrov hit out at Britain during a visit to Berlin.
""There are no facts which we can address meaningfully,"" he told after meeting German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas. ""It is pointless to have this discussion and we confirmed to our German partners that we see no proof.""
""The 'highly likely' principle isn't appropriate in this case, which British colleagues are using to rally their European partners against Russia. This is linked to Brexit - that's why London is doing this,"" he added.
Lavrov also said he doubted that evidence furnished by Britain to its allies in the affair was convincing - drawing an immediate rebuke from Maas.

""Naturally we have been given information by Britain, and we have no reason to question that information,"" Maas said, urging ""everyone to contribute to clearing this up"", including by sharing information about the two Russian suspects London has named in the affair.

1174,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>","Turkey to freeze new government projects, Erdogan says","By Humeyra Pamuk and Daren Butler
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey is freezing new government investment projects, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday, to rein in spending and stem double-digit inflation after a 15-year construction boom fueled by debt.
His comments, a day after the central bank hiked interest rates by a mammoth 6.25 percentage points, mark the clearest signal yet that the government may suspend some of the big-ticket bridges, ports and railway projects that have typified Turkey's transformation under Erdogan.
But it remains to be seen if the move, like the central bank's greater-than-expected tightening, will be enough to mollify investors, who have helped send the lira  down by 40 percent against the dollar this year.
Financial markets have long been concerned about Erdogan's control over monetary policy, which they say has undermined the central bank's ability to fight inflation, now at 18 percent. He has described himself as an ""enemy of interest rates"".
""We are not considering any fresh investments right now,"" Erdogan said in a speech on Friday. ""There could be extraordinary and must-do investments, that's another issue, but apart from this, we will start looking (at investments)"". 
Projects that are more than 70 percent complete will be finished, he added, but ""all our ministries will be reviewing the investment stocks they have and will conduct their work by prioritizing.""
In a decade and a half in power, Erdogan and his government have built bridges, power plants and hospitals and improved the lives of millions of lower-income, pious Turks. But some of his more ambitious mega-projects have drawn a backlash for their excessive cost and their impact on the environment.
Istanbul's third airport is due to be one of the largest in the world when it opens in October.
Erdogan has also announced plans for a 45-kilometre (28 mile) canal that would turn the western side of Istanbul into an island and is estimated to cost around $16 billion.
The president did not say whether the canal would be among the projects frozen.
BIG HIKE
The lira  was trading around 6.100 on Friday, a day after the central bank announced the biggest hike in its benchmark interest rate in more than a decade, to 24 percent.
Finance Minister Berat Albayrak, who will announce details of a medium-term economic plan next week, has promised cost-cutting measures and more efficient spending.
""Just a rate hike is not enough,"" said Charles Robertson, Renaissance Capital's global chief economist and head of macro-strategy, saying that Turkey needed to publish stress test parameters of banks and details of fiscal tightening, as well as secure external funding.
""The economy is entering recession, interest rates will be hurting, so the more they do to improve investor sentiment, the better."" 
Erdogan also made clear on Friday his continued hostility to higher borrowing costs.
""Yesterday the central bank carried out the much talked about interest rate hike... Now we will see the result of (central bank) independence,"" he said.
""Right now, personally, I am being patient, but my patience has its limits because we can't accept a lever of exploitation.""
The slide in the lira in July and August, combined with rising fuel and energy costs, pushed up the prices of many goods, but Erdogan urged private sector companies to keep producing and said authorities would not tolerate stockpiling. 

""Plenty of people who stockpile have emerged. Our interior ministry and finance ministry will be giving the necessary answer to these people… by carrying out raids,"" he said.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland's intelligence agency said on Friday it had worked with British and Dutch counterparts to foil a Russian plot which, according to newspaper reports, was targeting a Swiss laboratory testing nerve agents such as Novichok. 
Earlier on Friday a Swiss and a Dutch newspaper reported that authorities from the three countries had teamed up in an operation which resulted in the Netherlands expelling two suspected Russian spies in March. 
Citing unnamed sources, the Tages-Anzeiger and NRC Handelsblad reported that the suspected agents were heading for the Spiez laboratory near Bern which analyses chemical and biological weapons, including nerve agent Novichok.
Britain says Moscow used Novichok to try to kill former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the English city of Salisbury in early March and last week charged two Russian men in absentia with attempted murder.
""Swiss authorities are aware of the case of Russian spies identified in The Hague and expelled from there,"" the Swiss NDB intelligence agency said in a statement. 
""The NDB took active part in this operation together with its Dutch and British partners. The NDB has thus contributed to preventing illegal activity targeting critical Swiss infrastructure.""
It did not elaborate.
The Russian embassy in Bern dismissed the Swiss account.
""We consider such false statements simply absurd and nothing other than another attempt to stoke an anti-Russian atmosphere,"" it said. 
The newspapers said the two suspects expelled from the Netherlands were not the same as the two men charged by British prosecutors in the Skripal case last week.
The Dutch military intelligence agency MIVD did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Dutch government announced on March 26 that it would expel two Russian ""intelligence agents"" who worked at the Russian embassy in The Hague, without giving further details.
A spokesman for the Spiez laboratory declined to comment on the NDB statement, but said the government facility had previously been the target of cyber attacks. 
In July the Spiez lab said hackers had circulated a malware-loaded document purporting to be a factsheet linked to a scientific workshop the lab organized, but that it was unaware of any direct attacks on the lab itself. 
British authorities tested the Novichok found in Salisbury at Porton Down, a defense facility nearby, but have not said where else the substance might have been analyzed.
The newspaper reports said the alleged Russian plot had gone beyond cyberattacks and that authorities found ""equipment used for espionage"" during their operation against the suspected spies.

In the weeks after the Skripal poisoning, Britain and dozens of other countries have kicked out scores of Russian diplomats, and Moscow has responded tit-for-tat in the biggest East-West wave of expulsions since the Cold War.

FREETOWN (Reuters) - Corrupt Sierra Leonean officials have been selling fraudulent service and diplomatic passports for thousands of dollars to individuals hoping to use them to enter the United States, the country's anti-corruption commissioner told Reuters.
Africa has a thriving black market for illegal passports, prompting the United States, Britain and others to tighten visa regulations for countries where the issue is most acute.
In Sierra Leone, a recent investigation uncovered a large network of bureaucrats selling passports for up to $7,000 and assisting buyers to apply for US visas with them, said Commissioner Francis Ben Kaifala, who was appointed last June.
""We have evidence of high-ups at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Immigration Department participating, and neither agency has much, if any, control over it,"" he said in an interview on Thursday. 
""There have been many, many people to gain access to the US this way, with passports that were not proper. It's systemic.""
Representatives of the foreign ministry and the immigration office declined to comment.
The investigation follows a request from the U.S. government in 2017 for the West African country to tighten its passport-issuing procedure after a higher-than-average number of Sierra Leoneans visiting the United States were found to be overstaying their visas.
On Monday, nine people were arrested by Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) officers assisted by US Embassy security and consular personnel for attempting to apply for visas with fraudulent service passports, which are meant to be used only by government employees for work-related travel.
Among those detained was Alieu Kanu, Sierra Leone's former ambassador to the United Nations, who the ACC alleges organized the sale of the passports and accompanied the buyers to add credence to their applications.
Kanu's lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.
According to the anti-corruption commissioner, several unnamed foreign ministry and immigration department officials were arrested on charges relating to the investigation two weeks ago, while the former minister of immigration is currently on the run after a warrant was issued for his arrest last week. 
In September 2017, the US suspended the issuance of short-term visas for foreign ministry and immigration officials who had applied in Freetown. It said the restriction could be extended to other citizens if Sierra Leone did not takes steps to establish reliable processes for issuing travel documents to and from the United States.
The average overstay rate of foreigners entering the United States on non-immigrant visas is 1.9 percent, but the average overstay rate for Sierra Leoneans is 12.6 percent, according to the Department of Homeland Security.
""This passport cartel is a major reason for (Sierra Leone's high overstay rate),"" Kaifala said. ""People who obtain these illicit passports are not traveling with the intent of coming back. They say they're going for a conference or visiting family and just stay.""
Fake passports are a problem across the continent. In 2017, the UK and New Zealand ended visa-free travel programs for South Africa due to high levels of counterfeit and fraudulently obtained document use. 
In 2015, Guinea-Bissau announced that more than 1,600 people had been found to be using service and diplomatic passports acquired through illicit means.

BEIJING/CARACAS (Reuters) - China made no mention of new funds for Venezuela's struggling government on Friday after President Nicolas Maduro visited his key foreign financier in hopes of securing new loans.
Premier Li Keqiang told Maduro, who is on a four-day trip to China to discuss economic agreements, that Beijing is willing to provide the crisis-hit country with what help it can, according to Chinese government statements on Friday.
But there was no reference in Chinese state media or in Chinese government statements to China agreeing to provide new funds for Venezuela, which is struggling with a fifth year of recession and an economy wracked by hyperinflation.
Maduro said on Thursday he was going to China with ""great expectations"" and promised to return with ""big achievements.""
Li told Maduro that China supported Venezuela's efforts to develop its economy and improve people's livelihoods. It was also willing to keep developing business and trade exchanges, and hoped that Venezuela could provide more ""policy support and legal guarantees.""
Venezuela's Information Ministry said on Friday it had signed 28 agreements with China to develop oil fields, gold mining and telecommunications. It was not clear whether the agreements were all new.
The agreements included $184 million in financing for the joint oil venture Petrozumano and the transfer of 9.9 percent of the Petrolera Sinovensa oil project to China, the ministry said in a statement.
Over a decade, China ploughed more than $50 billion into Venezuela through oil-for-loan agreements that helped China secure energy supplies for its fast-growing economy while bolstering an anti-U.S. ally in Latin America.
The flow of cash halted nearly three years ago, however, when Venezuela asked for a change of payment terms amid falling oil prices and declining crude output that pushed its state-led economy into a hyperinflationary collapse.
Venezuela's finance ministry in July said it would receive $250 million from the China Development Bank to boost oil production but offered no details. Venezuela previously accepted a $5 billion loan from China for its oil sector but has yet to receive the entire amount.
In a separate meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping Maduro said Venezuela was willing to ""explore effective financing methods"" with China and strengthen cooperation with China in the energy sector, Chinese state media said, citing Maduro, without elaborating.

Xi told Maduro China would, as before, support the Venezuelan government's efforts to seek stability and development.

German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer announced on Thursday he had secured an accord with Italy over the issue on the back of similar deals with Greece and Spain. 
Earlier this year Chancellor Angela Merkel's government almost collapsed because of a row over migration and border controls. Ever since, it has pressed southern EU states to take back asylum seekers previously registered in these countries.
Seehofer told the German parliament on Thursday that he expected to sign the Italian deal shortly, but Salvini cautioned on Friday that he wasn't ready to put his name to the accord.
""My signature is still not there because I'm waiting for further clarification,"" Salvini said following a conference on migration and security hosted by Austria in Vienna.
However, the Italian minister told reporters he had received reassurances on some key points, including a pledge that for every migrant Germany returned to Italy, the German authorities would accept a bonafide asylum seeker from Italy.
""There must be a zero balance,"" said Salvini. 
But he said he wanted ""to see the availability and openness"" of Germany on two other issues - a revision of both the EU's Dublin Treaty on how Europe handles asylum requests, and of the EU's Sophia naval mission which is patrolling the Mediterranean.
Italy is seeking an overhaul of the Dublin Treaty so that there is an automatic distribution of asylum seekers throughout the EU, instead of requiring them to stay in the country where they first touch European soil, as is the case now.
It also wants to change the mandate of Operation Sophia, which at present says that all migrants picked up in the Mediterranean must be taken to Italy.
Italy has become the main route into Europe for hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers arriving by sea since the other main route from Turkey to Greece was largely shut in 2016. However numbers have fallen dramatically over the past 12 months.
Salvini said that since June Germany had picked up ""no more than 200"" migrants who had initially registered in Italy.
""So, in a nutshell, I will sign a deal for the possible readmission of these 200 people provided that 200 other immigrants leave Italy and go to Germany,"" Salvini said.

He added that the mooted accord would provisionally run until November ""to see if it is useful"".

PARIS (Reuters) - France plans to boost cycling with better bike lanes, financial incentives for bicycle commuters and measures against bike theft, the government said.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, who will formally announce the plan later on Friday in the Atlantic coast city of Nantes, told local daily Le Courrier de l'Ouest the state will invest about 350 million euros ($410 million) over seven years in cycling infrastructure. 
""The idea is that the state will help local authorities finance a number of infrastructures that will help reduce discontinuities between bike lanes and to facilitate dangerous crossings,"" Philippe was quoted as saying. 
Unlike most other transport policy issues, bike lane construction is not a national but a municipal responsibility, which means that most French bike lanes only run for a short stretch and rarely connect to other cities' bike facilities. 
Cycling organizations have long asked for more continuity in bike lanes because interruptions make people afraid to cycle to work. 
Olivier Schneider, head of French Bike Users Federation FUB, said the 350 million euro cycling fund falls well short of French President Emmanuel Macron's election promise of 200 million euros per year, but he said he hoped it would spur municipalities into planning new bike facilities. 
""Fifty million euros per year will not turn France into the Netherlands, but it is a start,"" Schneider said. 
In the Netherlands, cycling accounts for nearly 30 percent of all trips. That compares with just 3 percent in France, despite the fact that nearly half of all trips are less than 5 kilometers, according to Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne.
The French government also plans to widen financial incentives for bike commuting. Philippe said that from 2020, civil servants will get a 200 euros ($233) per year tax-free premium for cycling to work, while private companies will have the option to pay their employees up to 400 euros per year. 
The bike premiums will be free of tax and social security contributions, but Philippe said it would not be possible to combine them with tax incentives for public transport use. 
Cycling organizations say it is crucial to combine cycling and public transport for long-term commuting. 
The government also plans to put in place a mandatory identification engraving system for new bikes in order to prevent bike theft, will allow more two-way bike traffic on one-way streets, and will introduce cycling lessons in schools.

The Vostok-2018 (East-2018) drills, which run until Sept. 17, are taking place in Siberia and in waters off Russia's eastern coast, involving 300,000 troops, over 1,000 military aircraft and two naval fleets.
The drills are taking place at a time of heightened tension between the West and Russia, and NATO has said it will monitor the exercise closely, as will the United States which has a strong military presence in the Asia-Pacific region.

BERLIN (Reuters) - A scandal over migrants being chased through the streets has exposed a rift between Angela Merkel and Germany's security establishment that is dividing her coalition and hindering efforts to contain the fall-out from her ""open door"" refugee policy.
The crisis blew up when Hans-Georg Maassen, chief of the BfV intelligence agency, said he was not convinced far-right extremists had attacked migrants in the eastern city of Chemnitz last month and a video said to show the violence may be fake.
That put Maassen at odds with Merkel, who said the pictures ""very clearly revealed hate"" which could not be tolerated.
""For a more decisive chancellor, this would have been enough to fire him,"" said Carsten Nickel at political consultancy Teneo Intelligence, adding that support for Maassen from Merkel's conservative Bavarian allies was staying her hand.
Now, Merkel is caught between her Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), which backs Maassen, and her other coalition partner, the left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD), who say he has lost credibility and must go.
The upshot is that the chancellor looks weak, her coalition is in crisis and she is less able to deal with pressing issues such as Brexit, European Union reform and trade problems with the United States.
""The migration issue will certainly continue to haunt Merkel until the end of her term,"" said Nickel. 
The Maassen row has its roots in Merkel's 2015 decision to open Germany's borders to refugees fleeing war in the Middle East. More than one million came in total.
""Maassen is not an isolated case. Maassen is part of the security community,"" said Robin Alexander, author of 'Die Getriebenen, or 'Those Driven by Events', an account of how Merkel and her lieutenants handled the refugee crisis.
""For this security community, autumn 2015 was a disaster - not just for Maassen, but for all of them,"" he added. ""There is a deep alienation of the whole security community from the chancellor, and that was not the case in Germany previously.""
FRUSTRATED SPIES
The rift opened up in October 2015, when Merkel put her chief of staff, Peter Altmaier, in charge of Germany's response to the refugee crisis, with Emily Haber - a diplomat - acting as point person in the Interior Ministry.
That chain of command effectively shut out the security services, which couldn't get face time with Merkel.
""That totally frustrated these people ... they were horrified,"" said Alexander.
In private, Maassen complained about the difficulty of keeping tabs on the refugees and assessing whether they posed a security risk.
His cause got a boost with the 2017 election, when the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) surged into parliament for the first time and Merkel had to reshuffle her government.
CSU leader Horst Seehofer, who had called Merkel's handling of the refugee crisis a ""reign of injustice"", was made interior minister. He gave Maassen political cover to push his security agenda, which he duly did.
In an interview with Reuters in January, Maassen, 55, called for a review of laws restricting the surveillance of minors to guard against the children of Islamist fighters returning to Germany as ""sleeper agents"" who could carry out attacks.
Maassen also clashed with other more circumspect government officials when he said Russia was the likely culprit behind cyber attacks on Germany.
SPOKE TOO SOON
Then came Chemnitz. This time, Maassen publicly questioned the authenticity of the video before his agency had finished its work on the incident.
""The bottom line is that he spoke before the agency finished its assessment,"" said one source familiar with the issue.
In a Sept. 10 letter to the Interior Ministry, seen by Reuters, in which he explained his comments on Chemnitz, Maassen said he wanted to shed light on events after the state premier of Saxony, where the city is located, denied migrants had been hounded.
But the letter failed to draw a line under a scandal that has also revived questions about Maassen's ties to the far-right AfD.
A former leader of the AfD's youth wing, Franziska Schreiber, wrote in a book she published this year - ""Inside AfD: The report of a drop-out"" - that Maassen had advised ex-AfD leader Frauke Petry on how the party could avoid being put under surveillance by his agency. He has denied giving such counsel.
Fresh allegations arose on Thursday, when the BfV was forced to deny a report by public broadcaster ARD that Maassen had told an AfD lawmaker about parts of a report from his agency before it was published.
But Maassen has the backing of Seehofer, who said the intelligence chief ""gave a convincing explanation of his actions"" to a committee of lawmakers on Wednesday.
The SPD nonetheless called a crisis meeting of governing party leaders on Thursday. 
Coalition sources said the decision by the leaders of the three ruling parties to adjourn the Thursday meeting until next Tuesday could mean they hope Maassen will voluntarily step down.

However, the situation could be complicated by a meeting of the CSU on Saturday. If it supports Seehofer's decision to back Maassen and he does not quit, coalition leaders will be under pressure to take a decision on Tuesday.

The Prison Officers' Association (POA) union wants the government to issue better personal protection equipment to its 28,000 members and reduce levels of violence and overcrowding in jails.
Prison officers had demonstrated outside jails across England and Wales early on Friday morning, defying government demands to return to work.
But meetings with UK Prisons Minister Rory Stewart had subsequently led to assurances on the POA's concerns, a union spokesman said.
The state of prisons in Britain has made headlines in recent months. Inspectors warned on Thursday that inmates of Bedford jail in central England did not follow rules and were using drugs. Last month, the government took over the running of another prison for similar reasons.
Official figures published in July showed that assaults on staff jumped 26 percent in the year to March 2018 to 9,003 incidents, although a change in how issues were recorded may have contributed to the rise. 
""The violence has been brought by a reduction in staffing levels,"" said Blessing Uwede, POA representative, at Wormwood Scrubs jail in west London, where about 35 staff had walked out.
The government says it is working to address POA concerns.
""Yesterday we doubled the prison sentence for anyone who assaults prison officers,"" a Ministry of Justice statement said. ""We've also increased pay, provided tools such as body-worn cameras to increase security on the landings, and are investing 40 million pounds ($52 million) to improve the estate and tackle the drugs problem which is fuelling much of the violence. 

There were now also 3,500 new prison officers to help ease the burden, it added.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will scrap the twice-yearly seasonal clock change across the bloc from October 2019, leaving member states to decide by April whether they will stick permanently to summer or winter time, the European Commission said on Friday. 
Since 1996, EU law has required all EU countries to move forward by an hour on the last Sunday of March and back by an hour on the final Sunday in October.
""There will be no more seasonal clock changes as of the end of October 2019,"" Commissioner Violeta Bulc told a news conference on Friday, acknowledging that this relied on others following the Commission's ""ambitious"" schedule.
The proposal follows an EU survey drawing in a record 4.6 million responses and showing 84 percent of them opposed to seasonal clock changes.
The Commission also says seasonal time switches are outdated, implemented during World War One and Two and the 1970s oil crisis to save energy.
""Newer studies confirm that the energy savings are nowadays marginal,"" Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic said. ""We are clearly heading toward smart cities, smart buildings and smart solutions which will bring much more savings than changes of the clock.""
Critics of the twice-yearly clock changes say it can cause long-term health problems, especially among young children and elderly people. Others argue that making the switch to give extra morning daylight in winter and evening light in summer can help reduce traffic accidents and save energy.
The European Parliament and the 28 national governments will need to find common positions by the end of the year, the Commission said. Both bodies need to back the proposal, a process that can often take up to two years. 
The Commission said it was meeting its promise to act on big issues, but leave EU countries to take decisions where they are best placed to do so.
""Either we will stay with summer time or those countries that decide to go to winter time, they will switch to winter time in October (2019) and that will be it,"" Bulc said. 

Among those to back the proposal to scrap the clock changes are Spain and Finland, which has the most northerly EU national capital.

Salvini, who heads the League party, has led a popular crackdown against immigration since Italy's coalition government took office in June. He was speaking at a closed-door session of a conference on migration and security hosted by Austria, which holds the rotating European Union presidency.
""I heard someone say we need immigration because the population is aging. I see things completely differently,"" Salvini told the session in remarks filmed and posted on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) profile. 
""I'm paid by citizens to help our young people start having children again the way they did a few years ago, and not to uproot the best of the African youth to replace Europeans who are not having children anymore... Maybe in Luxembourg there's this need, in Italy there's the need to help our kids have kids, not to have new slaves to replace the children we're not having.""
Jean Asselborn, Luxembourg's foreign and immigration minister, was sitting a few places down from Salvini and grew visibly angry as Salvini spoke, finally interrupting the Italian in French with ""Allez, allez, allez"", suggesting he had gone too far.
""In Luxembourg we had tens of Italian immigrants. They came as migrants, who worked in Luxembourg so that you could in Italy had money to pay for your children,"" he said in French, concluding with the exclamation ""Merde alors!"".
Asselborn was apparently referring to the decades following World War Two, when several European countries took in migrant workers to meet the demand for labor during a prolonged economic boom.

The conference, which includes some European and African interior ministers as well as EU officials, was due to wind up on Friday afternoon. Salvini was also due to hold a joint news conference with Austrian far-right leader and Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache at 4:15 p.m. (1445 GMT) on Friday.

1188,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>",Libya's divisions,"By Aidan Lewis
CAIRO (Reuters) - Libya is set to miss a mid-September deadline to fix a framework for elections in December, part of a U.N.-led effort to reunify and stabilize a country that splintered after the Nato-backed uprising which overthrew Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. 
The capital has been shaken by heavy clashes and a militant attack on the headquarters of state oil firm NOC, casting new doubt on the election plan. 
WHAT'S BEHIND THE LATEST VIOLENCE?
Powerful armed groups, including ultra-conservative Salafists and neighborhood militiamen, have consolidated their grip under the watch of the internationally recognized government. 
The growing strength and wealth of these ""super militias"" has stirred resentment among rivals excluded from the capital or from access to lucrative financial scams and the shadow economy. 
The splits have also given space to Islamist militants trying to regroup after Islamic State lost its stronghold of Sirte in 2016.
WHO CONTROLS WHAT?
Since disputed elections and an escalation of fighting in 2014 there have been rival governments, one based in the east and the other in the capital Tripoli. 
Tripoli is home to the unelected Government of National Accord (GNA), an interim administration brought in by a U.N.-brokered deal in December 2015. 
The GNA has built some fragile alliances in western regions, but has little popular support or leverage over Tripoli's militias, on which it depends for its own security. 
Eastern Libya is under the control of the Libyan National Army (LNA), led by veteran military commander Khalifa Haftar, a former general under Gaddafi who fell out with the late dictator. 
The east-west division has split key institutions and produced a deadlock between the rump parliaments aligned with rival, shifting military factions. 
However, international support has allowed the NOC in Tripoli to retain control of fluctuating oil production, a vital source of income. 
Energy revenues are processed through the central bank in Tripoli, which disburses state salaries, dollars for importers and funds for the GNA – a process that Libya's Audit Bureau and U.N. experts say is riddled with corruption. 
Neither the eastern nor western camps have much control over Libya's south, where communitarian violence sometimes erupts and where smugglers, Islamist militants and mercenaries are active. 
HOW DID WE GET HERE?
Libya's faultlines began to show as local groups took up arms seven years ago against the Gaddafi regime, but also against each other. 
Militias claiming revolutionary credentials, their numbers swelling as more young men were added to the payroll, hijacked the political process in a country awash with weapons.
Things deteriorated before and after elections in 2014, when a battle for control of Tripoli destroyed the city's international airport. 
Haftar, presenting himself as the scourge of Islamists, began a campaign in Benghazi that took more than three years to complete and left parts of Libya's second city in ruins.
Islamic State were expelled from Sirte in 2016 by local forces supported by U.S. air strikes, oil production partially recovered as blockaders were sidelined, and migrant smuggling networks were curbed last year under strong Italian pressure.
But without reconciliation, those gains remain fragile.
WHAT'S AT STAKE?
Libya has a population of just 6.5 million but a vast land area with largely unguarded borders. 
It has been a source of large-scale smuggling and trafficking of people toward Europe. 
Libya has Africa's largest oil reserves, and is a key supplier of gas to Italy. As conflict has disrupted oil production, Egyptian and Tunisian migrant workers have lost out. 
More than one million Libyans need humanitarian assistance, according to the U.N. 
WHY ELECTIONS?
International efforts to broker a deal between the main factions have repeatedly failed.
The U.N. deal in 2015 had little support from powerbrokers on the ground. Subsequent efforts to form a unity government with national backing ran aground in rival assemblies in Tripoli and the east, which themselves have only limited legitimacy. 
France has pushed for polls as a way to end the stalemate and hosted a summit in May at which the election date target of December 10 was set. 
Key figures including Haftar and GNA Prime Minister Fayez Seraj, both potential candidates, have publicly backed the idea of elections. The United Nations cites recent voter registration as evidence that Libyan citizens are keen for a national vote as a way to make a clean break. 
Others are more skeptical about early polls, notably Italy, the only Western state to have fully reopened its embassy in Tripoli. It has been vying with France for influence in Libya. 
Diplomats say privately that political, security and logistical challenges make a successful vote hard to achieve. The international community's latest attempts to get the eastern parliament to pave the way for elections have produced little concrete progress.
The assembly, still recognized as the primary legislative chamber, is boycotted by many of its members and controlled by factions that have spurned the U.N. process and the GNA. They have used procedural delays and sometimes physical force to prevent key votes from taking place. 

A Paris summit deadline ""to set the constitutional basis for elections and adopt the necessary electoral laws"" by Sept. 16 will therefore be missed.

The military government has promised, and repeatedly delayed, a general election but steps this week, including royal endorsement of laws on the election of members of parliament and the selection of senators, are the surest signs yet the schedule for a return of democratic rule is being fixed.
""Political parties will be allowed to conduct important activities ahead of the election,"" the military government said in a statement published in the Royal Gazette.
The government did not explicitly say the ban on public gatherings of more than five people remained in place, but it said parties could not campaign.
""Parties can communicate with their members electronically, but not appear to be campaigning,"" it said, while warning that authorities could block such communication ""if it is illegal or a breach public peace"".
The military has been running Thailand since the May 2014 coup, when it ousted the civilian government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, citing the need to end street protests, and banned political activity in the name of peace and order.
The ban has quelled overt rivalry between populist political forces and the old Bangkok-based establishment, which had triggered bouts of violence and military interventions in politics for more than a decade.
But divisions remain just below the surface.
The election will be held under a new constitution, written by an army-appointed committee, which critics say is designed to prolong the military’s influence over politics for years to come through unelected bodies and other mechanisms.
The military says the constitution should eliminate cycles of political instability.
An election date has not been officially set but senior government officials have said it will be held by May.
Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters on Thursday it would be held on Feb. 24 but the Election Commission has yet to confirm a date.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's electoral regulator misinterpreted the spending law when it allowed the main Brexit campaign to donate to a smaller, aligned group during the 2016 referendum campaign, London's High Court ruled on Friday. 
Britain's officially designated Brexit campaign group, Vote Leave, said the Electoral Commission had told the group it could donate to other Leave campaigners without having to count it against its own referendum expenses.
But the High Court found that the Electoral Commission ""misinterpreted the definition of 'referendum expenses'"" in a way which was ""inconsistent with both the language and the purpose of the legislation"" in giving the advice.
Jo Maugham, a lawyer and campaigner on the winning side of the case, said the decision was ""coruscating"" for the Commission, and that the main Remain campaign had not been given the same rights to make donations.
""What is now clear is that the Electoral Commission unlawfully tilted the playing field in the Referendum,"" he said in a statement.
Vote Leave was separately fined by the Electoral Commission in July for co-ordinating its activities with the smaller campaign group, BeLeave, to pay digital services from Aggregate IQ, thereby exceeding spending limits. The campaign group refuted the findings.
The Electoral Commission said Friday's ruling showed the court had backed up its July findings.
""The Court arrived at the same conclusion as the Commission did in its investigation - that Vote Leave should have accounted for the expenditure on the digital services firm, Aggregate IQ – although it found an additional reason for reaching that conclusion,"" the regulator said in a statement.
But Vote Leave Chief Executive Matthew Elliott said the court's ruling undermined the Electoral Commission's earlier finding, adding that the campaign group would not have made the donation if they had not been advised that they could.
""The Electoral Commission's defeat in the High Court today has thrown electoral law for future elections and referendums into total chaos,"" he said in a statement. 
""Either the Electoral Commission is wrong or the High Court is wrong.""

MALAKAL, South Sudan (Reuters) - Yellow flowered vines crawl through empty window frames and up crumbling brick walls. Electricity poles are slanting along the road, cables hanging dead from their arms. The sign for Malakal's city council is riddled with bullet holes.
South Sudan's President Salva Kiir and rebel groups may well have signed a peace agreement on Wednesday to end a civil war that has killed at least 50,000 people, but those who have fled the country's second largest city, a merchant hub turned ghost-town, are still fearful of going back.
Josephine Adiemis, who lives with her family of eight in a nearby camp run by the United Nations, does not believe it is safe yet to go back home. Squatters may have sneaked into her house amid the chaos, the 42-year-old said.
""There is no peace now. If I go back before peace implementation, I will maybe be killed by that person that is still in my house,"" Adiemis said, sitting in front of a registration office at the U.N. camp, overlooking hundreds of makeshift houses covered in white plastic sheets.
Simon Pakuang, who ran away from his village near Malakal, situated on the White Nile, can relate to this. 
""The fighting broke out, and then so many people were killed. That's why people ran,"" said the 63-year-old, now living in the camp alongside some 25,000 people.
Violence flared up in the area in 2015. South Sudan had plunged into warfare in 2013, two years after independence from Sudan, when a political dispute between Kiir and then vice-president Riek Machar erupted into armed confrontation.
In total, an estimated quarter of South Sudan's population of 12 million has been displaced and its economy, which heavily relies on crude oil production, ruined. 
PEACE PROSPECTS
In Malakal, a former hub for goods shipped to neighboring Sudan, tables lie in abandoned schools, damaged Korans can be seen in abandoned mosques, and cars rot in fields. 
The U.N. camp near Malakal was meant to be temporary, said Hazel de Wet, who runs the U.N. mission in Malakal's Upper Nile region. 
She is cautiously optimistic about peace prospects in the area. But before people return from the camp to their homes in Malakal and the surrounding villages, security challenges must be addressed, she said.
""People came to seek protection, and therefore, before they would want to leave, they would want to be assured of their safety and security,"" she told Reuters.
Peter Aban Amon, minister of information in the Upper Nile region, said he was encouraging people to go back home.
""Malakal is well managed by the government, which is now functioning,"" he said, adding that the city had already seen a slight population growth over the past two years.
However, a glance at the area suggests that most people still prefer the security offered by the heavily guarded U.N camp. Its market is bustling while Malakal's previously busy market is eerily quiet. Fish caught from the Nile are taken directly to the U.N. market, not the city's.
Malakal has been site of numerous battles between government SPLA-forces and rebel groups. It has changed hands many times and has been almost completely destroyed in the process.
And for Pakuang, the time to go back has not arrived yet.
When he visited his village to look for his house in May last year, he was happy to see that it had not been wrecked in the crossfire - but surprised to find it occupied. 
The squatters asked him if he wanted his house back, but he said no. Instead, Pakuang asked them to take care of his home until he feels safe enough to resume his old life.
""I told them: please keep it clean and please don't destroy it.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is racing to secure power supplies ahead of winter after a devastating quake left 41 people dead and damaged generating stations on the northern island of Hokkaido, where temperatures regularly drop well below zero in colder months. 
Although the government has eased an initial 20 percent power-savings target for residential and business customers on the island of 5.3 million, Japan's trade and industry minister Hiroshige Seko has said power supplies on Hokkaido will remain tight and unspecified savings are still needed. 
Regional utility Hokkaido Electric Power is rushing to repair broken generators and bring on idle power plants, but those efforts will come up against the brutal reality of winter in Hokkaido, where temperatures can reach as low as minus 41 Celsius (minus 42 Fahrenheit). 
Power demand on Hokkaido in winter is typically more than a third higher than in the warmer months before the quake. 
""The harsh reality is that we have to ask for power savings every winter in Hokkaido,"" trade and industry minister Seko told reporters on Friday. 
Asked if he was confident there would be enough supply to cope with the rise in demand, Seko said it was too early to say. 
Temperatures in urban areas on the island are already dropping below 10 Celsius in early morning hours, while snow was recorded in the mountains of northern Hokkaido on Aug. 17, the earliest snowfall since 1974, local press have reported. 
Sufficient power supplies for winter heating may depend on whether Hokkaido Electric can get its biggest coal-fired plant - Tomato-Atsuma - fully operational after the quake damaged all three generators at the station, Seko said. 
On Tuesday, Seko said his ministry will investigate Hokkaido Electric's response to the quake, which left an island the size of Austria without power after Tomato-Atsuma was shut down. It was the nation's worst outage since the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northeastern Japan. 
MAP: Earthquake in Hokkaido - https://tmsnrt.rs/2oJz6zd
Fully restarting the Tomato-Atsuma power station, will take more than a month, Seko said earlier this week. 
Hokkaido Electric engineers cannot inspect its No. 4 unit, the biggest, because it is still too hot after a fire broke out in its turbine, a company spokesman told Reuters by phone.
Depending on the damage, repairing or replacing turbines can take weeks or months. 
To cover the shortage, the utility brought online by Friday afternoon two hydro-electric units at its Kyogoku plant. By November, Hokkaido Electric says it also plans to restart three oil-fired units undergoing maintenance. 
It is also firing up a coal power station it planned to mothball early next year and another oil-fired station it had planned to close next year, the utility has said. 
The utility will as well start testing a new gas-fired power station next month, but the spokesman said the utility was not sure the unit would be ready ahead of winter. 
Hokkaido can count only on limited supplies from the main island of Honshu because of the fragmented nature of Japan's power grid. 
Power demand on Hokkaido peaked at 5.25 gigawatts last winter, according to Hokkaido Electric. That compares with about 3.83 gigawatts on the day before the quake struck. 
About 3.5 GW of power are now available including from the Honshu connection, said the Hokkaido Electric spokesman. 
Temperatures fell to 5.9 Celsius in Asahikawa, Hokkaido's second-biggest city, on Wednesday, and averaged minus 4.3 Celsius there during December last year. 
Japan's record low temperature was minus 41 Celsius in Asahikawa in 1902.

(Reuters) - Former Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon is helping to craft the curriculum for a leadership course at a right-wing Roman Catholic institute in Italy, stepping up his efforts to influence conservative thinking in the church.
Benjamin Harnwell, director of the Dignitatis Humanae Institute based in a mountaintop monastery not far from Rome, told Reuters Bannon had been helping to build up the institute for about half of its eight-year life.
Cardinal Raymond Burke, a leading Vatican conservative who is president of the Institute's board of advisers, said Bannon would be playing a leading role there. 
Burke told Reuters he looked forward to working with Harnwell and Bannon ""to promote a number of projects that should make a decisive contribution to the defense of what used to be called Christendom"".
Bannon's increased engagement with the Institute demonstrates how his involvement in Europe extends beyond electoral politics to an effort to build a populist faction inside the Catholic Church. 
Bannon told Reuters this week that after Nov. 6 Congressional elections in the United States, he will spend ""80-90 percent"" of his time in Europe building up his Brussels-based populist ""Movement"".
Bannon, who has visited the Institute's home at the 800-year-old Monastery of Trisulti and addressed the organization by video link, is helping to draw up the coursework for a training program for conservative Catholic political activists and leaders, Harnwell said. 
Bannon is also raising funds for the institute in both Europe and the United States, he added. The institute has set ""very high academic standards"", Harnwell said.
Harnwell, a former European Parliament staffer, also is advising Bannon on his campaign to build a populist Movement across Europe that will support far-right parties in next year's European Parliament elections, he and Bannon said. 
Bannon and the Vatican did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this story.
EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
Harnwell said he founded the institute while working as an aide to a British Conservative European Parliament member. At the time, one of the legislature's committees was trying to block Rocco Buttiglione, a confidant of Pope John Paul II, from becoming European Commissioner for justice and security.
During a confirmation hearing, Buttiglione, who was nominated to the European Commission by then-Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, described homosexuality as a sin and said the principal role of women was to have children. Amid political uproar, Buttiglione withdrew from consideration for the Commission. 
Harnwell said Buttiglione was a ""founding patron"" of the Dignitatis Humanae Institute, whose mission he described as ""defending the Judeo-Christian tradition"" and promoting ""human dignity based on the image of God"". Harnwell added: ""If you don't have a culture of religious principle, we no longer have a credible basis for life.""
Buttiglione, who described himself as a convinced pro-European, said there were some differences between him and Harnwell. ""I am interested in a cultural dialogue with the so-called Populists but I am not one of them and, first and foremost, I am a Catholic and I stand by the pope,"" he said in statement to Reuters. 
Harnwell said the Institute was setting up two training programs: a leadership course that Bannon is helping to design, which Harnwell described a an ""academy for the Judeo-Christian West"", and the Cardinal Martino Academy, named after a former papal ambassador to the United Nations, which will promote pro-life Catholic social teachings.
RABBLE-ROUSING
Bannon, a rabble-rousing conservative media entrepreneur and activist popular with Trump's base, was fired from the White House a year ago, but the former adviser remained a Trump ally.
Bannon returned to the right-wing Breitbart News website, which he had headed before running Trump's presidential campaign. In January, Bannon quit as Breitbart's executive chairman after angering Trump by harshly criticizing his eldest son.
Leaving Breitbart threatened Bannon's dream of leading a new political movement that supports his ""America First"" agenda of tougher trade deals and immigration laws.
Harnwell said the Institute expects to present its first courses next year. The monastery is large enough to accommodate 250-300 students at a time. 
Burke, the former Archbishop of St. Louis, has been a leading light at the Institute since 2013 and is an outspoken critic of some policies of Pope Francis. 
Since Francis' election in 2013, Burke has led the charge by conservatives who have sharply criticized the pope, saying he has left many faithful confused by pronouncements that the church should be more welcoming to homosexuals and divorced Catholics and not be obsessed by ""culture war"" issues such as abortion.
Burke is president of the Institute's ""advisory board"", Harnwell said. The cardinal has condemned Islam as a threat to the West, a position that strongly parallels one of the principal political campaign themes of both Bannon and Trump. 
In 2014, Pope Francis removed Burke as chief of the Vatican's Supreme Court, the Apostolic Signatura, and demoted him to become patron of the Order of Malta, a charitable organization. 
Bannon is in ""communication"" regularly with Burke, although Harnwell acknowledges that the three-times divorced Bannon ""doesn't pretend to be a model Catholic"". Harnwell said the institute itself ""takes no view on the pope"" or his policies. 
Burke has met several times with Matteo Salvini, Italy's far-right deputy prime minister, Harnwell said. Earlier this summer, Salvini ordered Italian ports to stop allowing landings of ships carrying refugees fleeing Middle East strife. 
After meeting Bannon in Rome last weekend, Salvini announced that he was joining the populist Movement Bannon was setting up aimed at disrupting the European Union.

Britain has charged the two men, who appeared on Russian TV on Thursday, with attempting to murder former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia by spraying a chemical weapon on Skripal's door in March.
When asked on a conference call if Moscow would agree to let British police question the men in Russia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said:

Sanchez, who took advantage of a long-running corruption scandal to topple his predecessor in a confidence vote in June, threatened to take legal action earlier this week after Spanish newspaper ABC accused him of copying parts of his thesis. 
Center-right opposition group Ciudadanos joined forces with the previous ruling party, the conservative PP, to demand Sanchez appear in parliament to respond to the accusations. 
On Friday, the Prime Minister's Office said testing showed that Sanchez's work complied with academic consensus on plagiarism rules and verification protocols. 
His Socialist government holds only 84 of 350 parliamentary seats and his party can ill-afford any loss of support along partisan lines as he seeks to drum up backing for next year's budget.
Sanchez has said he aims to remain in government until the end of the term in 2020. 
Just three days ago, Carmen Monton resigned as health minister after reports of irregularities in how she obtained a master's degree. Monton denied the reports but said she was stepping down to avoid damaging the government.
She was the second minister to depart in just over three months, after a scandal over a 10-year-old tax fine prompted former culture minister Maxim Huerta to step down.
The head of the opposition People's Party, Pablo Casado, is now under increasing pressure to publish details of his own degree, which the High Court ruled last month had been awarded in dubious circumstances.

Casado has denied any wrongdoing.

1201,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 14, 2018 05:33AM ET</span>","At summit, South Korea's Moon seeks to play 'chief negotiator' between Kim, Trump","By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - Next week's inter-Korean summit will test whether South Korean President Moon Jae-in can pull off his role of mediator and salvage stalled nuclear talks between Pyongyang and Washington.
Moon will cross the border into the North for his third meeting with Kim Jong Un on Tuesday, amid scepticism over whether the North Korean leader was serious about denuclearization, a goal vowed at his summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in June. 
Trump last week asked Moon to act as ""chief negotiator"" between Washington and Pyongyang, according to Moon's spokesman, after Trump canceled a visit to Pyongyang by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last month.
Moon will discuss ways to achieve that goal with Kim, seeking to engineer a proposal that combines a concrete framework for North Korea's denuclearization and a joint declaration ending the 1950-53 Korean War, Seoul officials said.
(A land divided https://tmsnrt.rs/2KdXMcS) 
The South Korean scheme would call for Pyongyang to promise to reveal or declare its nuclear and missile facilities, followed by a joint end-of-war declaration, two sources familiar with the issue said. North Korea would then provide an actual list of the sites for verification and eventual decommissioning by international inspectors, said the sources who were not authorized to speak publicly.
Pyongyang and Washington have been at odds over whether the North's denuclearization or declaring a formal end to the war should come first. 
The Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, leaving U.S.-led U.N. forces including South Korea technically still at war with the North.
""The deadlock resulted from mutual demands that the other side take action first, and I think we can surely find a point of contact,"" Moon Jae-in told a meeting on Thursday with advisers on the summit.
""One of the roles we should play in the middle is to find the point of contact and present it, and expedite dialogue again to accelerate the denuclearization process."" 
South Korea is pinning high hopes on Kim's remarks to Moon's special envoys last week that he wants to realize denuclearization within Trump's first term in office ending in early 2021, the first time line he has ever given. 
In another upbeat sign, Kim has offered a second summit in a ""very warm, very positive"" letter to Trump, and the White House said it is looking at scheduling one.
""The United States would want to have a solid roadmap, but the North has been avoiding it and instead unilaterally taking what it calls denuclearization measures that fall far short of U.S. expectations,"" said Cho Tae-yong, a former South Korean deputy presidential national security advisor and nuclear negotiator. 
""If President Moon manages to help both sides move toward some kind of framework agreement, he could indeed wind up being a catalyst for negotiations, but that's a very tough task.""
'TOO LITTLE TRUST'
Compared to the first summits in April and May, where the mere fact of Kim and Moon's meeting mattered, the two are now under pressure to deliver substantive progress.
North Korea has demanded U.S. security guarantees as key conditions for its disarmament, and ending the war is an integral element of that. 
U.S. officials say they have already made their own conciliatory gestures, including halting joint military exercises with South Korea.
""For the United States, there's too little trust in North Korea to make an end of war announcement just with their promise to declare the facilities,"" a diplomatic source in Seoul told Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
""As for the North, such declarations are too much to give for ending the war, which could be done only with a piece of paper."" 
Frank Aum, a senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington, said Moon may need to press North Korea for more definitive steps, such as freezing nuclear and missile production, amid signs that the North is continuing to produce nuclear weapons.
Setting specific target dates for each action would also be key, suggested Shin Beom-chul, a senior fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. 
For example, the North could promise to submit a list of facilities by November in return for an end of war declaration in December, and arrange a first round of inspection in early next year, he said. 
""It's not a losing game for Trump - inducing North Korea's commitment to facility declarations and inspections would itself be a diplomatic coup for him,"" Shin said.
KOREA TIES OR DENUCLEARIZATION?
Leaders of the two Koreas will also examine progress on their April summit agreement to improve inter-Korean relations and reduce military tensions.
As first steps, North and South Korea will open a joint liaison office on the North's side of the militarized border on Friday to serve as a de facto embassy.
The neighbors are also discussing reconnecting railways and roads, and lessening guard posts along the heavily militarized border. 
But Moon's desire to advance ties with the North despite little progress on denuclearization has raised alarm bells in Washington, with U.S. officials worrying it could weaken Pyongyang's resolve to disarm.
Moon's officials also asked top South Korean business leaders to join his Pyongyang trip. But company executives say tough economic sanctions, effectively banning any business with the North, could make it tricky to go this time around. 
Officials at Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), Hyundai Motor, LG - which were part of delegations for 2000 and 2007 summits in Pyongyang - said no decision has been made yet on participating.
In July, three South Korean firms imported coal from North Korea disguised as Russian products in violation of U.N. sanctions, South Korea's customs agency said. 
""The import of North Korean coal already demonstrates that South Korea has not vigorously imposed U.N/U.S. sanctions,"" said Bruce Bennett, a senior researcher at the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, California.

""How will President Trump feel if South Korea is responsible for undermining his campaign?""

Reports of mass detentions and strict surveillance of Muslim ethnic Uighur people in the far western region have sparked a growing international outcry.
A U.N. rights panel said last month it had received credible reports that up to a million ethnic Uighurs may be held in extra-legal detention, and called for them to be freed.
Chinese authorities have also set up thousands of police checkpoints across the region, and human rights advocates have decried martial law conditions and mass DNA collection.
The new EU ambassador, Nicolas Chapuis, who took up his posting this week, told reporters the European Union had been taking note of reports on abuses in Xinjiang, and had raised the issue with China, but it needed facts.
""The union's stance is that we are working in the United Nations framework,"" Chapuis said.
""We believe in dialogue. We believe in engagement, and first of all, we need the facts,"" he said, without elaborating.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Xinjiang in recent years in unrest between members of the Uighur minority who call the region home and members of the ethnic Han Chinese majority.
Beijing says Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists. Officials deny mistreating Muslims there, instead saying they are putting some people through ""vocational"" style courses to prevent militancy spreading.
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Manisha Singh told a congressional hearing on Thursday that Washington was weighing sanctions against Chinese senior officials and companies linked to allegations of human rights abuses there.
But Chapuis said the European Union must engage with China if it wanted to be more than a ""soft power"".
""The strengthening of the EU-China relationship would show how the union would grow as a full power, not only as a soft power,"" he said. 
""To do this, engaging China for us is an absolute must.""
Chapuis added that there was an ""urgency"" to strengthen EU-China relations in the context of the ""triangulation"" between the United States, China and the European Union.
On the subject of global trade, he said it was normal for major trading partners to have some commercial friction, echoing a line used by Chinese officials to play down disputes. 
Amid an escalating U.S.-China trade war, Beijing has put pressure on the EU to stand with it against U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies, though the world's largest trade bloc has largely rebuffed those efforts, and broadly agrees with the U.S. assessment of unfair Chinese trade practices.
Nonetheless, Chinese state media has promoted the message that the EU is on China's side, and some European officials have expressed concern that China is seeking to capitalize on divisions between Trump and U.S. allies in Europe.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine authorities evacuated more areas on Friday and warned an estimated 5.2 million people in the path of a powerful typhoon to stay indoors, as the country braced for heavy rain and damage to infrastructure and crops.
Super Typhoon Mangkhut is expected to barrel through the northernmost tip of the Philippines early on Saturday, carrying 205 kph wind speeds, and gusts of up to 255 kph, that it has maintained since it struck Micronesia earlier in the week.
More than 9,000 people have been moved to temporary shelters as Mangkhut, locally known as Ompong, makes its way towards the rice- and corn-producing provinces of Cagayan and Isabela where it is forecast to make landfall at dawn on Saturday.
Weather forecasters warned of destructive storm surges as high as six meters in coastal villages in the typhoon's path. 
Second and third contingents of rescue teams were being prepared, in case first-responders get into trouble themselves, and disaster officials said tens of thousands more people may have to be moved. 
""My appeal is that we need to heed the advice of the authorities. Stay indoors,"" said presidential adviser Francis Tolentino, the government's main coordinator for disaster response.
The storm picked up speed slightly on Friday and was about 450 km east of the Philippines at noon. Footage posted on social media by Cagayan residents showed trees being whipped by fierce winds under dark grey skies as rain lashed down on buildings.
The capital, Manila, and more than three dozen northern and central provinces have been placed under storm warning signals. Classes have been suspended and government offices shut early in more than 600 places, while military personnel, medical and emergency response teams were put on stand by.
The coastguard said about 5,000 passengers were stranded at several ports by the impending storm, which will head on towards southern China and Vietnam.
In the Philippines, the strongest impact could be felt in 10 provinces now under storm signal 3, a notch below the highest level. Nearly one million people in affected areas live below the poverty line.
""The concerns here are landslides and infrastructure being washed away,"" said Junie Cua, governor of Quirino province on the main island of Luzon.
""We have made preparations for those eventualities by pre-positioning our relief goods and having our equipment on standby.""
Authorities are taking extra precautions as they draw comparison with Typhoon Haiyan, which devastated central areas of the archipelago in 2013, and killed 6,300 people, many in storm surges that reached as high as eight meters.
Damage to crops in a worst-case scenario could reach about 157,000 tonnes of paddy rice and about 257,000 tonnes of corn, worth 13.5 billion pesos ($250 million), the agriculture ministry said.

That could result in tightness in the domestic rice supplies of rice, at a time when retail prices are already high, which would compound worries about inflation.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North and South Korea opened a liaison office on the North's side of their heavily militarized border on Friday, setting up a permanent channel of communication as part of a flurry of efforts to end their decades old rivalry.
Steps by North and South Korea to improve their relations are running parallel to a bid by the United States and its allies to press North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. 
The opening of the joint liaison office at Kaesong, just inside the North Korean side of the border, comes days before North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in are due to hold their third meeting this year. 
""The two sides are now able to take a large step toward peace, prosperity and unification of the Korean peninsula by quickly and frankly discussing issues arising from inter-Korean relations,"" said Ri Son Gwon, the head of North Korea's delegation at the opening ceremony.
The two Koreas previously communicated by fax and special telephone lines, which were often severed when their relations took a turn for the worse. 
Now they will now be able to ""directly discuss issues 24 hours, 365 days"", South Korea's Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon said at the ceremony. 
The office will be staffed by up to 20 people each from the two sides with the South Koreans on the second floor and the North Koreans on the fourth floor of the four-story building.
Vice minister-level officials will head their teams at the office and will attend weekly meetings, the South Korean Unification Ministry said.
The office is at the site of the Kaesong industrial complex, where for about a decade, South Korean companies ran production lines staffed by North Korean workers at the industrial park.
The park, once the most striking symbol of inter-Korean cooperation, has been closed since February 2016 when tension on the peninsula spiked after North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test.
South Korea's Unification Ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun said this week it was hoped the liaison office could also help the United States and North Korea in their negotiations.
""We hope that this will also help the progress of denuclearization talks between North Korea and the United States,"" Baik said.
Moon and Kim, who agreed on a series of steps to improve ties at an April summit, will meet in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang next week, when it is hoped they can help end an impasse between the United States and North Korea.
South Korea had hoped to open the office by August but it was delayed when denuclearization talks between the United States and North Korea stalled after an historic summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore in June.
However, Kim sent a message to South Korean envoys last week saying he wanted to achieve denuclearization during Trump's first term.

That followed what Trump described as a ""very warm"" letter from Kim requesting another meeting, which rekindled hopes for progress.

Racing against a Sept. 30 deadline when the current fiscal year ends, Republicans and Democrats were showing unusual cooperation in trying to fund most federal agency functions and avoid an embarrassing government shutdown about a month before congressional elections.
A trio of massive spending bills were making their way through Congress to fund military, energy and a range of other programs that otherwise would run out of money on Oct. 1.
But House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen said that some decisions will have to be put off until Dec. 7, after congressional elections.
That means that Congress would continue to fund agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security at current year levels on a temporary basis.
In recent weeks, Trump has threatened a government shutdown unless he got the money he wanted to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to keep illegal immigrants and illegal drugs out of the United States.
A White House spokeswoman would not say whether Trump would go along with Congress' plans if lawmakers did not immediately meet his demand for more border wall funding.
""We look forward to reviewing the bill when it’s released,"" said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters.
Trump campaigned for president in 2016 vowing to build a wall that he said Mexico would finance.
But Mexico has balked and Trump instead has had to turn to Congress for construction funds. Lawmakers provided $1.57 billion this year for physical barriers and related technology along the southwest border.

Some have estimated the total cost of the edifice at more than $24 billion.

Putin appeared to catch Abe off guard when he said at a regional forum in Vladivostok on Wednesday that the two countries should sign a peace treaty by the end of this year - without preconditions.
""We need to read the signals from various comments President Putin has made. It is true that he proposed to work properly on a peace treaty. Of course, Japan's stance is to resolve the territorial dispute and then conclude a peace treaty,"" Abe said during a televised debate with his rival for a Sept. 20 ruling party leadership election.
""I said so before and after the comment (from President Putin), and President Putin has made a response. But I cannot talk about it because we are in the middle of negotiations... What I can say is that I believe a summit meeting in November or December will be an important one,"" Abe added.
The two leaders are likely to meet at one or both of two regional summits later this year.
Both Moscow and Tokyo claim sovereignty over the islands, known in Russia as the Kurile islands and in Japan as the Northern Territories. Abe has made resolving the feud a key plank of his political platform.
Experts said, however, that Putin's suggestion would be hard for Japan to swallow since in effect it means abandoning its claims to the Russian-controlled islands.
It was questionable whether Putin really wanted to resolve the issue, said James Brown, a political science professor at Temple University's Japan campus.
""Since the Japanese government cannot accept the proposal without abandoning its claim ... it has no choice but to reject it,"" Brown wrote in a column in the English-language Japan Times. ""This makes Japan look like the obstacle to a peace treaty.

Abe has said a deal would unlock trade and investment from Japanese companies for Russia, which is isolated from Western investment because of sanctions. For Putin, who casts himself as a champion of Russia's national interests, giving up the islands would risk a domestic political backlash.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Thursday turned back an aggressive challenge from actress and activist Cynthia Nixon in the race for the Democratic nomination for November's general election.
The New York Times and Associated Press called the race for Cuomo, who held a two-to-one lead on Nixon after a bitter race that saw Cuomo spend about $18 million. More than 1.4 million people voted in the primary, doubling the race in 2014.
The win makes Cuomo, who is seeking his third term, the heavy favorite headed into the Nov. 6 election against Republican Marc Molinaro. 
Nixon is best known for her role on HBO's ""Sex and the City"" and was seeking office for the first time. She had trailed in polls by more than 30 points throughout the campaign. She ran on issues like voting reforms and fixing New York City's subways, and accused Cuomo of poor governance. 
""We took on one of the most powerful governors in America. It wasn't easy,"" said Nixon, in remarks delivered to supporters in Brooklyn after conceding the loss. 
""We had to fight just to get on the ballot. We had to fight just to get a debate. We started with nothing, and we earned every single vote,"" she said.
Left-wing candidates have rung up a series of victories in nominating contests, with more liberal candidates being nominated in governor's races in Georgia and Florida. But knocking off incumbent governors is harder, particularly one with Cuomo's cash. 
Earlier this campaign season, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley both upset long-serving Democratic incumbent congressmen in nominating races in New York and Massachusetts, promising more vigorous liberal policies and highlighting their opposition to Republican President Donald Trump. 
It was the latest attempt by candidates from the party's energized left wing to gain a further hold on the Democratic party as Democrats seek to regain control of the U.S. Congress and bolster their ranks in state governments across the country in the Nov. 6 elections. 
Cuomo, 60, controls the party's state machinery and secured endorsements from members of the party establishment. He has drawn ire from left-wing activists in the state who believe he has been too willing to negotiate with state Senate Republicans. He was considered potentially vulnerable to a challenge after his former campaign manager and several other lawmakers were convicted in a corruption trial.
However, Cuomo ran on his efforts to fund higher education, and highlighted his support for gun control, gay marriage and paid-family leave, and he shifted to the left by softening positions on marijuana legalization and on felony voter rights.
""The Governor ran an active campaign highlighting his experience and policy achievements, which may have overcome voters' concerns about corruption or his liberal bona fides,"" said Daniel Lewis, associate professor in political science at Siena College.

Cuomo this year also ended an arrangement between a group of Democratic state senators who decided years ago to caucus with the Republicans, handing them control of that chamber. Several of those Democrats were defeated in primary challenges on Thursday.

“The little museums displaying sacred objects touched by the leader are an integral part of the cult of personality that Kim Il Sung and his crew first developed along Soviet lines,” said Bradley Martin, a journalist who wrote a book chronicling the Kim dynasty, referring to Kim Jong Un’s grandfather and the country's founding leader.
“Those efforts intensified as Kim Jong Il, before taking full power himself and while he was in charge of propaganda, made Kimilsungism into a veritable religion.”
At their core, the memorials are meant to underscore the supreme leader’s personal hand in guiding success at the given facility, analysts say.
Kim has intensified visits to economic and infrastructure projects this year as part of his new emphasis on economic development after saying North Korea had achieved its goal of becoming a nuclear-armed nation.
He has publicly criticized unfinished power plants and the healthcare sector, praised new rail bridges, and provided advice at a bag factory. In every case, he appeared to portray himself as personally indispensable in the well-being of North Korea.
BOOST IN RESOURCES
Visits to facilities usually correspond with an increase in resources, a move analysts say is key to the Kims showing themselves as fatherly leaders who personally provide for their citizens.
North Korea’s state media has not mentioned what happened to the officials publicly rebuked by Kim, although a recent report by the defector-run website Daily NK said some officials scolded by Kim during his visit to a medical appliances factory last month have been fired and exiled.
But even those facilities Kim found faults with were likely to receive a boost in resources, said Hong Min, senior researcher of Korea Institute for National Unification.
“It’s inevitable that the facilities be given resource increases once Kim visit, regardless of whether they were rebuked or praised, because performance must be improved going forward,” Hong said.
At the cosmetics factory, the guide credited a visit by former leader Kim Jong Il with doubling soap production. Kim Jong Un’s first visit in 2015, meanwhile, led to the construction of a new wing of the factory, she said.
A school for training teachers in Pyongyang also featured rooms packed with memorabilia from the Kims’ visits, and plaques were placed over the doors of each classroom the leaders entered, including during a tour by Kim Jong Un in January.
“Thanks to our beloved leader’s love and care, our university was wonderfully reformed,” said a guide at the school.
Despite the growth in private markets, Kim Jong Un’s visits so far show he still envisions an economy with him at the center, which may limit the true extent of any reforms, Martin said.
At the model cosmetics factory in downtown Pyongyang, meanwhile, the guide reminds visitors that North Korea revolves around Kim.

“All of our workers and staff thank the beloved supreme leader who loves and takes care (of the people), creating miracles and renovation every day with the robust idea to carry on the task of modernization to the end,” she said.

1215,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 11:23PM ET</span>","U.S. sanctions Russian, Chinese tech firms over funds for North Korea","By Tim Ahmann and Hyonhee Shin
WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on a China-based tech firm, its North Korean CEO and a Russian subsidiary, accusing them of moving illicit funding to North Korea in violation of U.S. sanctions.
The new sanctions target China-based Yanbian Silverstar Network Technology Co, its North Korean chief executive Jong Song Hwa, and a Russian-based sister company, Volasys Silver Star, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement.
""These actions are intended to stop the flow of illicit revenue to North Korea from overseas information technology workers disguising their true identities and hiding behind front companies, aliases, and third-party nationals,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
Mnuchin warned companies across the globe ""to take precautions to ensure that they are not unwittingly employing North Korean workers for technology projects.""
South Korea's foreign ministry said the move was in line with the United States' resolve to keep up sanctions to achieve complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula while carrying out dialogue. 
A manager at Yanbian Silverstar, who would only give his family name Jin, said the allegations were ""impossible"".
""I've never heard of Jong Song Hwa,"" he told Reuters.
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has maintained sanctions pressure on Pyongyang in an effort to convince North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, which are a threat to the United States.
Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in June at a summit in Singapore where Kim agreed in broad terms to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. North Korea has however given no indication it is willing to give up its weapons unilaterally, as the Trump administration has demanded.
Washington has also accused Russia of violating U.N. sanctions on North Korea by granting work permits to North Korean laborers despite Russia's denial of any such actions.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley accused Moscow on Thursday of seeking to cover up breaches of U.N. sanctions on North Korea by Russians.
""VICIOUS SLANDER""
North Korea's official KCNA news agency said U.S. accusations that it was responsible for cyber attacks in 2014 and 2017 were a ""smear campaign"" and a man sanctioned by Washington earlier this month did not exist.
Washington charged and sanctioned Pak Jin Hyok and a Chinese-based front company he worked for, Chosun Expo, over the 2017 global WannaCry ransomware cyber attack and the 2014 cyber assault on Sony Corp (T:6758).
Park worked as part of a team of hackers, known as the Lazarus Group, to try to breach multiple U.S. businesses, including defense contractor  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), U.S. officials said, though there was no evidence the company was breached.
KCNA said Pak was ""non-existent"" and the act of cyber crimes mentioned by Washington ""has nothing to do with us."" 
""The U.S. farce of prosecution is none other than a vicious slander and another smear campaign full of falsehood and fabrication designed to undermine the DPRK,"" KCNA said, referring to the country's official name, Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 

""In reality, the U.S. is the chief culprit responsible for posing security threats in cyberspace.""

1216,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 11:13PM ET</span>",Taiwan courts security ties with bigger friends as Beijing snatches allies,"By Greg Torode and Jess Macy Yu
HONG KONG/TAIPEI (Reuters) - As Beijing intensifies its effort to further isolate Taiwan diplomatically, Taipei is actively but discreetly broadening security ties with regional powers beyond its long-standing relationship with the United States.
From efforts to share intelligence on China's military with India and the prospect of engaging Japanese experts in its submarine program, Taipei's push is gradually bearing fruit despite sensitivities surrounding relations with Taiwan, according to government officials, military attaches and diplomats.
As well as India and Japan, Taipei has targeted Australia and Singapore.
While the effort is being kept low-key to avoid further inflaming Beijing and adding to pressure on countries aiding Taipei unofficially, the moves mirror Taiwan's more public ""southbound"" policy to deepen commercial and cultural links with the region.
It also comes amid several recent successes by China in luring away some of the few nations that diplomatically recognize the democratically self-ruled island.
While Taipei battles to keep its remaining formal allies, it is keen to deepen strategic ties with larger regional powers, sensing an opportunity as they too seek to cope with a rising China, Taiwanese officials say.
""We want Taiwan and those countries to have more in-depth understanding of the strategic or security environment we are in,"" Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told Reuters.
As China grows more powerful and assertive, he said ""many of these countries feel the pinch and they might want to know more about Taiwan as an interest to them, rather than something they want to avoid.""
SWITCHING TIES
China considers democratic Taiwan to be a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. It has intensified military activity surrounding Taiwan in recent years. 
El Salvador switched ties to Beijing last month, while the Dominican Republic did so in May and Panama changed sides last year - leaving Taiwan with just 17 diplomatic allies, six of which are small Pacific island states.
""None of the other regional powers will come close to what Taiwan is doing with the U.S.,"" said Bonnie Glaser, a security expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""But it is clear that there are intersecting interests, and that these are being actively explored.""
Washington, like other major powers, maintains a ""one China"" policy that thwarts formal diplomatic relations with Taipei but remains by far Taiwan's largest weapons supplier and most powerful international backer.
That relationship has been boosted under U.S. President Donald Trump, whose administration is eyeing more weapons sales and is encouraging official exchanges.
According to U.S. estimates obtained by Reuters, on average 100 U.S. officials, including military personnel, visit Taiwan each week. 
Anecdotally, the intensity of interactions is rising under the administration of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen.
INDIA ADVANCES
While security ties with Tokyo, including some intelligence sharing, have been evolving for some time, Taipei's ties with New Delhi are rapidly growing, according to people familiar with discussions.
Unofficial military attaches have been placed within Taiwan's new de-facto embassy, the Taipei Economic Cultural Centre, while senior Indian military officers regularly visit Taipei on ordinary rather than official passports.
Taiwan also fields military attaches unofficially in Tokyo and Singapore as well as Washington. 
Taiwan's knowledge of Chinese military deployments, including troop movements in the west of the country are of particular interest, said an Indian source familiar with ties.
""We are dependent on Taiwan because they are watching the Chinese,"" the source said. ""Indian serving officers regularly go to Taiwan, they go on so-called study leave.""
When asked for a formal Indian government response, a source familiar with the government's thinking declined to comment on security cooperation, but said India's ""engagement with Taiwan is limited to economic and commercial links. And people to people contacts.""
Taiwan is also pushing Australia, a major U.S. ally, for closer co-operation, regional diplomats told Reuters. Discussions remained largely in the exploratory stage over shared interests over watching Chinese maneuvers in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, where China's presence is growing.
Like the Indian relationship, it is most likely to evolve into information sharing on Chinese activities, deployments and intentions rather than hard weapons' programs.
An Australian government spokesman declined to comment.
Euan Graham, a regional security analyst at the Sydney-based Lowy Institute, said Australia would likely remain cautious, despite deepening understanding in Canberra of Taiwan's strategic importance. 
""It might be a bit ambitious of the Taiwanese to think Australia would go as far as say Japan,"" he said. 
""Directly taking on a military-to-military relationship with Taiwan would be very uncomfortable for Australia.""
Singapore, however, has repeatedly signaled to Taiwanese officials it intends to maintain its low-key military presence on the island despite pressure from Beijing, according to people close to discussions.
That decades-old presence - revolving detachments of troops for infantry and heavy armor training - faced Chinese criticism in late 2016 when Hong Kong authorities temporarily seized armored personnel carriers being shipped from Taiwan to Singapore.
""Taiwan is pleased that Singapore has resisted Chinese pressure and, beyond the training elements, exchanges between senior officers are broad and deep,"" said one Singaporean scholar familiar with the relationship, speaking privately due to sensitivity that surrounds it. ""In the current environment they have plenty to talk about."" 
Speaking privately, other Singaporean academics say that state-linked Chinese counterparts frequently complain about Singapore's on-going military relationship.
""They inevitably ask: when is Singapore going to finally give this up?...the hint is clear,"" one veteran scholar said. 
Singapore's Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Taiwanese scholars said retired Japanese engineers have been coming to Taiwan to assist with research and development in its nascent submarine program. 
The Taiwanese defense ministry referred Reuters to a previous statement by the navy in which it said reports of Japan's assistance with Taiwan's submarine program was ""completely conjecture."" 
A Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said they had no knowledge of any involvement of Japanese engineers in the project. 
""Our stance toward Taiwan is based on the 1972 joint communique by Japan and China meaning our relationship is not an official one between governments but is conducted at a working level,"" the spokesman said.
More broadly, a Taipei-based think-tank close to the office of the president forms a key part of the growing semi-official effort.
The Prospect Foundation, in part funded by Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and with close ties to President Tsai's National Security Council, reaches out to a wide range of scholars, retired officials and military brass and sometimes still-serving officials.

As the foundation helps Taiwan create reciprocal exchanges, scholars have noted if serving military officers are involved, no uniforms are worn on foreign trips, underscoring the discreet nature of the missions.

1217,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 10:59PM ET</span>","U.S., Cuba officials discuss mysterious embassy health incidents","By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. and Cuban officials met at the State Department on Thursday to discuss the mysterious health problems that have affected more than two dozen American Embassy personnel, a situation that led to a reduction in staffing at the Havana mission and a chill in ties between the countries.
""There's a briefing taking place between some of our colleagues from our various bureaus. They are having meetings with the Cuban government to discuss some of the medical issues that our people have experienced,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a briefing.
Nauert, who declined to discuss details about the meeting, said the talks involved medical personnel and experts on the situation, as well as officials from the Cuban government.
Later on Thursday, Cuban members of the medical delegation that attended the meeting told reporters that they rejected the conclusion by U.S. officials that the affected Americans' medical conditions were the same across the group.
""We are unable to collectively support the hypothesis of health attacks and brain damage to U.S. diplomats as the explanations of the symptoms,"" the panel said.
They added, however that the illnesses were legitimate and may have had a psychological origin rather than a physical one.
""We cannot say it all can be explained by psychological challenges, but it cannot be discounted,"" said Pedro Antonio Valdés, a neuroscientist and one of the medical doctors on the panel. 
At least 26 Americans have been affected by a mysterious illness at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba with symptoms that included hearing loss, tinnitus, or ringing in the ears, vertigo, headaches and fatigue, a pattern consistent with mild traumatic brain injury, State Department officials have said.
The illnesses, which first appeared last year, were initially described as the result of sonic attacks or health attacks.
But on Thursday, the Cuban doctors said their review of the evidence showed that only three individuals with mild to moderate hearing loss were found, which could have been from preexisting conditions.
They also said that the evidence reviewed failed to demonstrate brain damage, and that it proved that only two to three of the American subjects had cognitive dysfunction.
NBC News reported earlier this week that U.S. officials believe the health problems may have been caused by sophisticated electromagnetic weapons.
NBC, citing administration officials and congressional aides, said the U.S. military had been trying to reverse-engineer the type of weapons suspected of causing the damage. The FBI and intelligence agencies declined to comment on the NBC report.
Nauert said the State Department has made no determination about who or what caused the health attacks. Cuban officials have denied involvement.
""Why do we have to look at the far-fetched hypothesis that some mysterious weapon was used to attack the Americans,"" he added, citing the need for a new explanation and his willingness to discuss the science behind the U.S. findings in future meeting hosted in Havana.
The State Department said in June that it had brought home a group of diplomats from Guangzhou, China, over concern they were suffering a similar malady.
In April, Canada said it would remove the families of diplomats posted at its embassy in Cuba due to concerns about a new type of brain injury.
The United States has reduced embassy staffing in Cuba from more than 50 to a maximum 18, forcing those who remain to take on multiple jobs.

The Government Accountability Office said in testimony to Congress last week that the State Department was having ""management challenges"" responding to the incidents.

1218,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 10:00PM ET</span>",Australian PM's own party defies him in selection of by-election candidate,"By Colin Packham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison's own party defied his wishes on Friday by nominating a former diplomat instead of a female candidate to run in a crucial by-election for a seat that belonged to the man he deposed in a leadership coup.
Morrison's Liberal party, the senior partner in a Liberal-National coalition, nominated Dave Sharma to run in the blue ribbon Sydney seat of Wentworth in the Oct. 20 by-election, another sign of the deep fractures within the party.
The by-election was called when former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull resigned from parliament after losing the leadership in a party-room ballot last month, handing Australia its sixth prime minister in 10 years.
Turnbull's resignation also meant Morrison's centre-right government at least temporarily surrendered its one-seat majority in parliament. Opinion polls suggest that could become more permanent, with Australian voters angry about frequent leadership changes.
Five independent lawmakers have guaranteed their support for the government to defeat no-confidence votes until the by-election.
Should the government lose the affluent electorate of Wentworth, a traditionally safe Liberal seat that stretches from Bondi Beach to Sydney Harbour, Morrison would then have to strike a new agreement with the independents to continue in a minority government.
Sharma is a former Australian ambassador to Israel and received the endorsement of both Turnbull and the Liberal party's elder statesman, former prime minister John Howard, although Morrison had hoped a female candidate would be chosen.
""Of course, I want to see more Liberal women in parliament,"" Morrison said on Twitter on Friday. ""But I always want to see the best candidate selected.""
Morrison's preference was seen as an attempt to contain allegations by several female backbench lawmakers that they were unduly pressured to support a leadership rival to Turnbull, claims that have sharpened the focus on a lack of gender diversity within the government.
Former deputy Liberal leader Julie Bishop, also the former foreign minister, criticized her party colleagues this week over the fact that less than 25 percent of its members of parliament were women.
Sharma was expected to win the biggest share of the vote in Wentworth but the ousting of Turnbull, a social liberal who was widely popular with voters could still affect the outcome. Votes could still flow to opposition and minor party candidates under Australia's complicated preferential voting system.

The latest leadership change and subsequent recriminations have already turned voters against the Liberal party, which suffered a swing of 29 percent swing against it at a New South Wales state by-election a week ago when it lost what had been a safe seat to an independent candidate.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley accused Moscow on Thursday of seeking to cover up breaches of U.N. sanctions on North Korea by Russians after it pushed for changes to an independent report on sanctions violations. 
The U.N. Security Council will meet on Monday over the implementation of sanctions on North Korea at the request of Washington, the U.S. mission to the United Nations said. 
The report, submitted to the Security Council's North Korea sanctions committee last month, said Pyongyang had not stopped its nuclear and missile programs and was violating U.N. sanctions on exports.
Diplomats said Russia pressured the independent sanctions monitors to amend the report. The Security Council has to agree by consensus on whether to publish the report and the United States objected to releasing the amended document. 
""Russia can't be allowed to edit and obstruct independent U.N. reports on North Korea sanctions just because they don't like what they say. Period,"" Haley said in a statement. ""The full implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions remains mandatory for all member states – including Russia.""
The Russian mission to the United Nations and the chair of the independent panel of U.N. sanctions monitors did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The amended report removed some references to Russians accused of breaching sanctions on North Korea, said one diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Russia and China have suggested the Security Council discuss easing sanctions after U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met in June and Kim pledged to work toward denuclearization.
The United States and other council members have said there must be strict enforcement of sanctions until Pyongyang acts. 

Washington on Thursday imposed sanctions on a China-based tech firm, its North Korean chief executive and a Russian subsidiary, accusing them of moving illicit funding to North Korea in violation of U.S. sanctions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is prepared for Israeli criticism of elements of its coming Middle East peace plan, the U.S. envoy to the region said, even as Washington faces growing Palestinian accusations that it will be heavily tilted in favor of Israel.
In an interview with Reuters, Jason Greenblatt, a chief architect of the long-awaited peace initiative, said U.S. negotiators had entered the “pre-launch phase” of the plan, despite a boycott by Palestinian leaders.
But he declined to specify a time frame, except to say it would not be announced at the U.N. General Assembly gathering in New York later this month, or offer any details of a proposal that has drawn deep skepticism even before its unveiling.
Pushing back against widespread perceptions among Palestinians, Arab officials and independent analysts that the peace plan is likely to be decidedly pro-Israel, Greenblatt made clear that both sides can expect parts they will like and dislike.
“We’re going to have to defend the plan to Israelis and Palestinians. We are ready for criticism from all sides, but we believe this is the best path forward for everyone,” he said as the administration moved to finalize the initiative, which is led by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
But there was no immediate explanation of what might disappoint Israelis, who have been largely pleased with President Donald Trump’s Middle East policies but have at times been rattled by suggestions he might ask them for significant concessions.
Greenblatt said, however, that the United States will recommend compromises but will not seek to impose a deal.
""The parties will need to decide if they think the plan works for them and will make their lives better,"" he said. ""The parties are the only ones who can make these compromises, and there are no compromises on Israel’s security needs.” 
Doubts have mounted over whether Trump's administration can secure what he has called the ""ultimate deal"" after it cut off aid to the Palestinians and ordered the PLO’s office in Washington shut, further angering Palestinian leaders and reinforcing their refusal to engage in U.S.-led diplomacy.
The Palestinians have refused to participate in the U.S. effort since December when Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and then moved the U.S. embassy there.
In late August, Trump hailed the embassy move as a success but said, without elaboration, ""in the negotiation Israel will have to pay a higher price because they won a very big thing.""
Trump’s aides later played down his comments.
It is unclear how the U.S. plan would deal with the sensitive issue of Jerusalem. Palestinians want the city's eastern part as their future capital.
ARAB WORLD'S ROLE
The Trump administration hopes Saudi Arabia and other Arab allies will support its peace plan once it is released but does not expect them to ""try to push the Palestinian people into a deal that the Palestinians don’t want,"" Greenblatt said in the interview on Wednesday.
Some U.S. officials have privately said they were counting on Arab states to use their influence with the Palestinians to convince them to come to the negotiating table.
Saudi Arabia’s King Salman recently has reassured other Arab countries and the Palestinians it will not endorse any plan that fails to address key Palestinian concerns. 
The Trump administration has signaled it is unlikely to be deterred from rolling out the plan even if the Palestinians continue their boycott.
With the “political component” of the plan at the point where it covers all core issues of the decades-old conflict, “We do have to get the economic portion of the plan finished,” Greenblatt said. “A successful economy is critical for the Palestinians.""
That is widely expected to include international funding proposals for the impoverished Gaza Strip.
U.S. officials have also been non-committal about whether the plan would endorse the creation of a Palestinian state, as the Palestinians have long demanded.

Senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said earlier this week that “we will not succumb to U.S. threats and bullying.”

Both the United States and Turkey, which are opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government, have warned that an attack on Idlib by the Syrian government, backed by Russia and Iran, could further destabilize the region and harm civilians. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has vowed to recover ""every inch"" of Syria.
However, Turkey and the United States have differing views about the YPG. 
The militia has been a strong ally of the United States in the fight against Islamic State. Turkey, on the other hand, considers the YPG a terrorist organization and an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has led an insurgency against the Turkish state since the 1980s.
Ankara has repeatedly expressed its anger over the U.S. support for the YPG.
In the letter to Times editors, which was in response to an op-ed the newspaper published last week, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu warned that Washington should ""asses who its real allies in the region are.""
""New reports suggest that the Y.P.G., a terrorist group operating from Syria that has received arms and aid paid for by American taxpayers, has forged an alliance with Mr. Assad and is sending troops as part of a deal brokered in July to help him recapture Idlib from the rebels,"" he wrote.
Turkey has said it is working with Russia and Iran to stabilize the Idlib region, indicating continued efforts to avoid a Syrian government offensive.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan met with the leaders of Iran and Russia last week in Tehran, but failed to win a ceasefire pledge.

Chilean prosecutor Emiliano Arias ordered the simultaneous raids in the coastal city of Valparaiso and the southern cities of Concepcion, Chillan and Osorno. 
The raids were prompted by information law enforcement officials uncovered in previous searches, said Diego Alcaino, a spokesman for Arias, by text message. He said the information relates to Oscar Munoz, a top aide to Santiago's archbishop, who faces charges over accusations of sexual abuse of at least five minors.
Munoz and his defense team are due to appear in court on Friday where they are expected to ask for him to be released from protective custody, Alcaino added.
Munoz's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Munoz has confessed to sex crimes in documents that were seized previously by Arias. Munoz's lawyer has acknowledged that some of the accusations in the documents are true but has said he will challenge some others. 
The archdiocese of Concepcion said in emailed comments that law enforcement officials took statements from several church office employees during the raid. It said that copies of some of the documents the prosecutors sought in the raid had already been handed over, but prosecutors seized the original documents.
""This archbishopric reiterates its full respect for and compliance with the law,"" it said.
The archdiocese of Valparaiso said in an emailed statement it handed over the documents that prosecutors requested. A representative for Chillan declined to comment. A representative for Osorno did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The searches are the latest in a series of raids carried out by police in church offices in recent months, as prosecutors look for new cases of sexual abuse or evidence that church officials concealed abuse from authorities. 
Last month, the Chilean government requested that the Vatican share canonical documents related to nine clergy members accused of sex crimes.
The ongoing church sex abuse scandal in the Andean nation has prompted Pope Francis to open an investigation that has led to the resignations of five bishops and priests.
Pope Francis has told Chilean Catholics affected by the sex abuse scandal that the church will ""never again"" ignore victims.

SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Thousands of Costa Ricans kept up a fourth day of marches and a wide public workers strike on Thursday to protest a proposed fiscal reform, dealing their center-left president his first major test since taking office in May. 
President Carlos Alvarado, 38, won a run-off election against a conservative rival in one of Central America's most stable nations, known for its eco-tourism. 
He called for dialogue with protesters this week and on Thursday met with University of Costa Rica representatives, saying he aimed to reach agreements. 
""This is the best way to take on the situation. We all want the best for the country,"" Alvarado said on Twitter. 
The demonstrations are some of the largest in a decade.
Thousands of unionized public employees began striking on Monday to reject the tax proposal, which is under discussion in Congress, arguing that it would disproportionately affect the middle and lower classes.
The reform would convert the country's 13 percent sales tax to a Value Added Tax, affecting more products and services.
On Thursday, strikers protested in the capital and university students marched toward the presidential residence, escorted by police officers. 
The largely peaceful demonstrations in a country known for its chilled-out ""pura vida"" approach to life did have several moments of unrest.

On Tuesday, a San Jose supermarket was looted and the entrance to a gasoline refinery was blocked, and on Wednesday, a splinter protest group tried to enter the Legislative Assembly, clashing with police. The same evening, a communications tower in the city of Puerto Limon was set afire.

The Boeing-made Poseidon aircraft, which are used for hunting submarines and conducting maritime reconnaissance, are worth up to $2.1 billion, the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said. 
The South Korean procurement agency Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) said in June it had decided to buy the P-8 Poseidon aircraft. 
At the time, the contract was worth around $1.71 billion. Thursday's DSCA authorization included training, logistics, support equipment and services that could affect the price.
U.S. ally South Korea is engaged in talks with North Korea on improving relations and the United States is involved in its own diplomatic efforts with North Korea on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Washington has put pressure on North Korea via sanctions to give up its nuclear weapons program.
The Patriot anti-missile systems, made by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Co, are to defend against ballistic missiles and will cost $501 million, the Pentagon said.
The Republic of Korea requested 64 Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) Missiles.

Verzilov, 30, staged a brief pitch invasion during the soccer World Cup final in Moscow in July along with three women affiliated to the anti-Kremlin punk band and is the publisher of Mediazona, a Russian online news outlet which focuses on human rights violations inside Russia's penal system. 
""Our friend, brother, comrade Petr Verzilov is in reanimation. His life is in danger. We think that he was poisoned,"" Pussy Riot said on its official Twitter feed.
Sergei Smirnov, editor-in-chief of Mediazona, struck a more cautious note however, confirming on social media that Verzilov was in hospital but saying nobody knew his diagnosis, making it difficult to understand what was going on.
Online news portal Meduza cited Veronika Nikulshina, who it said was Verzilov's girlfriend, describing how he had been rushed to hospital on Tuesday night after he started to lose his eyesight and ability to talk and walk.
Verzilov is also a citizen of Canada. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was worried by what happened, adding that Canadian consular officials had reached out to the hospital.
""It is of concern, obviously, particularly given actions of recent months by the Russians in the United Kingdom ... but it is too early to draw any conclusions about what has happened,"" he told reporters in the western city of Saskatoon.
Earlier this month Canada said it backed Britain’s assessment that Russian officers were behind an attack in March on a former Russian spy and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury. 
Verzilov and the others served a 15-day sentence for running onto the pitch in front of President Vladimir Putin and other high-ranking officials wearing police uniforms during the final of the World Cup on July 15, a stunt they said was meant to promote free speech.

Pussy Riot came to prominence in 2012 when its members were jailed for staging a protest against Putin in a Russian Orthodox cathedral in Moscow. The group has since become a symbol of anti-Kremlin protest action.

1228,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>","Italy government passes motorway decree, delays appointing commissioner","ROME (Reuters) - The Italian government approved a decree on Thursday aimed at speeding up the rebuilding of a collapsed motorway bridge in the northern city of Genoa that is a vital transport link for the whole country.
However, in a sign of internal divisions within the coalition government, the cabinet did not name the person it wants to oversee the reconstruction effort, with a row simmering over which companies should take part in the huge project.
A section of the bridge came crashing down on Aug. 14, killing 43 people in a disaster that highlighted the poor state of Italy's infrastructure, much of it built in the 1950s and 60s when far fewer cars and trucks were in circulation.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the government decree offered tax breaks to companies in Genoa that are likely to be hit by the loss of the bridge, which carried thousands of tonnes of goods every day, and financial help for the worst affected.
It also opened the way for the appointment of a special commissioner to orchestrate the reconstruction effort.
""The extraordinary commissioner will have ample powers to proceed and decide, to allow Genoa to have a more beautiful bridge, a brand new bridge,"" Conte told a news conference.
However, he said a candidate had not yet been named.
Giovanni Toti, the governor of the Liguria region, which is centered on Genoa, has pushed for the job, but he has clashed with Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli over who should be awarded the contract.
Toti said at the weekend that motorway toll company Autostrade, which is controlled by infrastructure company Atlantia, should be involved. The government has accused Autostrade of negligence and insists it should have nothing to do with the rebuilding.
There was no indication of when a commissioner would be appointed.
Toninelli said the government wanted to ensure that Italy's entire road network was safe and he announced on Thursday that his ministry would set up a new body staffed by 250 engineers to carry out a nationwide check-up on transport links.

""This decree responds to the needs not only of Genoa but to the security of all our infrastructure,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government will not lift sanctions against Zimbabwe until the new government of President Emmerson Mnangagwa demonstrates it is ""changing its ways,"" a senior U.S. economic official told a congressional panel on Thursday.
Manisha Singh, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs, told a House of Representatives hearing there were 141 entities and individuals in Zimbabwe, including Mnangagwa and former president Robert Mugabe, that are currently under U.S. sanctions.
""Our pressure on Zimbabwe remains in place. We are trying to use this pressure to leverage political and economic reforms, human rights observations,"" Singh said.
""We want to see fundamental changes in Zimbabwe and only then will we resume normal relations with them,"" she added.
Mnangagwa was sworn in as Zimbabwe's new president on Aug. 26 after the Constitutional Court confirmed his July 30 election victory, dismissing a challenge by opposition leader Nelson Chamisa.
Mnangagwa has called for the lifting of U.S. sanctions against officials from the ZANU-PF ruling party, top military figures and some government-owned firms, which were imposed during Mugabe's rule for it called violations of human rights and democracy.
The EU lifted most of its sanctions in 2014, but has maintained those against Mugabe and his wife Grace.
The July ballot was touted as a crucial step toward shedding the pariah reputation that Zimbabwe gained under Mugabe as well as securing international donor funding.
Rep. Karen Bass, a Democrat from California, said Zimbabwe was ""trying to reach out to us now and I want to know where we are with that.""

""We are always open to conversations. We are open to a demonstration from the government that it is changing its ways, that it is observing human rights,"" Singh added.

AMMAN (Reuters) - A Syrian rebel commander said on Thursday rare military exercises with U.S. marines in southern Syria sent a strong message to Russia and Iran that the Americans and the rebels intend to stay and confront any threats to their presence.
Colonel Muhanad al Talaa, commander of the Pentagon-backed Maghawir al Thawra group, told Reuters the eight days of drills that ended this week at the U.S. military outpost in Tanf were the first such exercises with live-fire air and ground assault, involving hundreds of U.S. troops and rebel fighters.
""These exercises have a big importance and have beefed up the defenses of the area and raised the combat capabilities and morale and that of civilians in the area,"" Talaa told Reuters by phone from Tanf, near Syria's borders with Jordan and Iraq.
A U.S. military spokesman said the exercises were a show of force and that the Pentagon had notified Moscow through ""deconfliction"" channels to prevent ""miscommunication or escalate tension"".
""The exercise was conducted to reinforce our capabilities and ensure we are ready to respond to any threat to our forces within our area of operations'"" Colonel Sean Ryan told Reuters in an email response to a question on the exercises.
Russia and the Syrian government have repeatedly called on Washington to pull out its troops from Tanf base, where it has declared a 55 km (35 mile)-radius ""deconfliction zone"" off-limits to others.
Rebels say hundreds of U.S. marines arrived this month in Tanf to join special operations troops already based in the garrison and participate in the drills, amid heightened U.S.-Russian tensions in Syria and a naval buildup in the Mediterranean.
The ""deconfliction zone"" has become a safe haven for at least 50,000 civilians who live in the Rukban camp that lies within it. Russia's defense ministry in August repeated an accusation that Washington has been harboring Islamic State militants within the zone. 
""We are staying whether the Russians or Iranians want or not,"" the rebel commander added.
The outpost, surrounded by desert, was established during the battles against Islamic State militants who used to control eastern Syria bordering Iraq.
After Islamic State were driven out, U.S.-led coalition warplanes struck Iranian-backed militias on several occasions to prevent them advancing, in what Washington has described as self-defense.
Tanf lies on the strategic Damascus-Baghdad highway, once a major supply route for Iranian weapons into Syria. 
This makes the base a bulwark against Iran and part of a larger campaign against Iran's military expansion in the Middle East.
Control of the area has long been a goal of the Syrian government and its Russian and Iranian allies.
Rebels say the U.S. military's new policy to bolster Tanf's capabilities is a big shift.
""The American position has changed completely toward the Iranians. Before it was just putting a line to the Iranians not to approach the areas,"" Talaa added.
Tehran's failure to end its military presence in Syria could provoke a U.S. military response, Talaa added.

""If Tehran does not respond to the demands of the Americans there is a big likelihood they will be hit. It's inevitable the Iranians leave Syria. This should happen quickly and in a decisive way,"" he added.

Wearing helmets and carrying shields, they used a hydraulic platform mounted on a truck to force activists from the treehouses erected in Hambach forest, west of the city of Cologne. 
Officers carried off some of the protestors who were trying to prevent utility RWE from clearing the forest that it bought decades ago to expand mining in the area. Most of the forest has already been chopped down and the activists were trying to save a remaining patch of green.
The activists had asked RWE to delay the logging until a year-end deadline for a commission to submit plans to the government for Germany to give up coal-fired energy.
Germany aims to raise wind and solar power's share of energy generation from a third now to 65 percent by 2030 to help to cut carbon dioxide emissions and achieve its climate commitments. 

Police said measures were being taken to prevent the activists from returning to the site. ""After the operation we will monitor people and vehicles trying to come here in order to prevent the reconstruction of what we so painfully dismantled,"" said police spokesman Paul Kemen.

PARIS (Reuters) - Restaurateurs in France want the government to speed up its asylum process and make it easier to identify suitable staff to help them fill thousands of jobs they say are increasingly snubbed by French workers.
The hotel, cafe and restaurant union GNI-Synhorcat says some businesses are downsizing or shortening their opening hours as a result of the shortage of manpower.
Under France's immigration laws, asylum seekers have to wait six months from lodging the application for refugee status before they can work.
""It's frustrating,"" said Alain Fontaine, owner of the Parisian bistrot Le Mesturet where waiters' cries of ""chaud devant"" -- or watch your back -- mix with the lunchtime chatter. 
Fontaine has employed several refugees in recent years, but only once they have waited months for their papers. 
""Here you have a workforce, you've got potential, you've got people who want to work, and on the other hand you can't hire them,"" Fontaine said. 
Unemployment in France hovers above 9 percent, a headache for President Emmanuel Macron who promises his business-friendly reform drive will create more economic growth and jobs. 
However, restaurateurs say the long hours and often low pay of their trade puts off some jobless French people.
France rewrote its immigration law this year and the target is to halve the time it takes to process asylum requests to six months from the average of 11 months when Macron won power last year.
Yet even when migrants become eligible to work, the paperwork can be daunting.
An Interior Ministry spokeswoman acknowledged the process was bureaucratic and said reform was under way to streamline it.
Malian Bakary Kanoute fled his home country at the age of 15. By then he had already developed a love for cooking and once he secured his immigration papers in France he sought work in a kitchen. He was hired by Fontaine.
""When you work, you're helping your boss and helping yourself,"" the 22-year-old said.
The GNI-Synhorcat union wants to work closer with migrant charities to identify potential workers for the cafe and restaurant industry earlier in the asylum process. It is holding consultations with lawmakers on how processes can be made more efficient.

""The moment a migrant is awarded refugee status ... we say bingo! We'll train them and hire them,"" GNI-Synhorcat union boss Didier Chenet said. ""We want to pre-empt that moment.""

1236,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",Brazil presidential candidate Bolsonaro recovering after surgery,"By Eduardo Simões and Ricardo Brito
SAO PAULO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Jair Bolsonaro, the Brazilian far-right frontrunner for president, on Thursday was recovering from emergency surgery with no complications, but his running mate said his return to campaigning would be further delayed. 
Bolsonaro nearly died after being stabbed last week by an assailant as he was carried aloft by supporters during a street rally. He underwent emergency surgery late Wednesday to repair an obstruction in his small intestine.
Albert Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo, where Bolsonaro is being treated, said in a statement he had been moved to intensive care after the emergency procedure. Bolsonaro has had three operations, including two emergency procedures, since the attack. 
The assassination attempt against the polarizing candidate plunged the most unpredictable presidential race since Brazil's return to democracy three decades ago into further confusion. 
Several candidates have a good chance of making it to a runoff vote. Polls show about one-fifth of voters, disdainful of the political class after four years of unprecedented corruption investigations across parties, remain undecided or say they will annul their ballots. Voting is mandatory in Brazil.
Bolsonaro's running mate, outspoken retired army General Antonio Hamilton Mourao, told Reuters on Thursday that the latest operation would delay Bolsonaro's return to the campaign trail. 
Mourao declined to say if Bolsonaro would be able to resume campaigning before the Oct. 7 first-round vote. 
Earlier this week, the country's most popular politician, jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers Party (PT), gave up hope of running after the top electoral court barred him because of his corruption conviction. Former Sao Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad, who was Lula's running mate, is now the PT's presidential candidate. 
Polls have shown that about one-half of Lula's supporters say they would vote for whoever runs in his place. That is likely enough support to push Haddad into a runoff, required in Brazil if no candidate wins a majority in the first ballot.
While Bolsonaro easily leads in polling on the first-round vote, surveys show he would likely lose in the Oct. 28 runoff.
The chance that one of the leftist candidates could be elected has spooked investors and sent Brazil's currency near record lows.
Bolsonaro, with a record of voting for state-led economic policies during his nearly three decades in Congress, named a prominent investment banker as the head of his economic team, and has vowed to privatize state-run firms and follow orthodox policies. 
A top member of his campaign team told Reuters on Thursday there was no chance of a return. The source spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to talk about the situation.
Bolsonaro's son Flavio said last week his father would not be able to attend rallies ahead of the vote.
""It's going to delay his return to activities,"" Mourao said by telephone. ""This anxiety over when he will return only results in causing him more stress.""
Mourao said there was still no decision on whether he would replace Bolsonaro in official campaign events, such as debates. 

""We're going to keep the campaign running, but there's no talk of replacing him,"" he said. ""I consider him to be irreplaceable.""

1237,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",Air strike warning app helps Syrians dodge death from the skies,"By Sarah Dadouch
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Russian military aircraft thunders into the sky at 4.47 pm from Russia's air base at Hmeimim in western Syria, veering to the east. 
An observer takes note of all three details, opens a phone app and enters the information into three designated fields.
Fourteen minutes later and 100 kilometers away, Abdel Razzaq sees the aircraft flying over his town of Maaret al-Numan. He opens his own app and types: Maaret al-Numan, Russian military aircraft, headed northeast.
The data is processed by a program, known as Sentry, that estimates the plane's trajectory and sends a warning, triggering Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Telegram messages, Tweets and, most importantly, loud sirens throughout cities in opposition-held Syria.
Air strikes have been a fact of daily life for millions of Syrians living in rebel-held areas, becoming far more intense since Russia joined the war in 2015.
Before Sentry was introduced, the main warning people had of an air strike was when they heard the planes themselves -- when it was already too late, said Omayya, 50, who was displaced from Aleppo to its northwestern countryside. 
""There was no use for one to do anything. Sometimes we would actually see the barrels as they fell,"" she said by Skype, referring to the barrel bombs -- oil drums filled with shrapnel and explosives -- dropped across rebel areas. ""We would watch and see the barrels fall and the children would cry."" 
Omayya attended a course run by volunteers about Sentry and how best to survive air strikes. She now knows to open her window so blast pressure doesn't shatter the glass and that her bathroom, in the middle of the house, is the best place to hide.
The volunteers taught Omayya's six grandchildren, three of whose fathers have died, what to do if they are told an air strike may hit their school. Naela, one of the volunteers, said they trained children to duck under desks and curl up in the fetal position if they hear the alarm. If the warning is early enough, teachers can take the children down to basements.
Women have emerged as one of the main targets of the campaign, Naela said: ""Women always carry their mobiles with them, so they get the message wherever they are, whether they are at home, in the kitchen, with their neighbor.""
The warning system was founded by two Americans, John Jaeger and his business partner Dave Levin, after Jaeger had held a job working with Syrian civilians for the U.S. State Department.
""I recognized that the biggest threat to peace inside of Syria was the indiscriminate bombing of civilians,"" Jaeger explained. ""We simply thought that there was more that the international community could and should do to warn civilians in advance of this indiscriminate violence.""
Their company, Hala Systems, says it has received funding from countries including Britain, Canada, the Netherlands and the United States as well as private donors. 
The White Helmet rescue workers operating in opposition-held Syria work with Sentry to operate and maintain air raid sirens.
""Before, whenever there was bombardment, we wouldn't have knowledge of a strike until the wounded reach us,"" said Yousef, a 23-year old nurse in a field hospital outside Aleppo.
""But now with Sentry, we immediately find out through our mobile that a strike happened. So we know that it's in this area, where there are civilians. So we know there are wounded for sure."" The hospital can notify doctors, make sure materials are prepped, and wait for the wounded.
""We hugely depend on (the system) because it's become the foundation of our work,"" he said. 
Around three million people live in Syria's last major rebel stronghold in northwest Syria. Half are already displaced, having fled government advances in other parts of Syria.
In preparation for an expected army offensive, civilians have been readying food and digging shelters. Some even improvised gas masks in case of chemical attacks.
PLANE SPOTTING
Last week, the Syrian government and allied forces resumed air and ground bombardments, although recent days have been relatively quiet, said Abdel Razzaq, who watches for aircraft and enters the information into the Sentry app.
He clicks on the image of a plane to identify what type of aircraft he saw. He chooses the location and what the plane is doing or where it's headed. This dispatches messages on channels like Telegram, sometimes with time-stamped warnings for specific towns and villages.
""9:37 pm: Shahshabo Mountain - transport aircraft now heading northeast. Can reach the following areas: Maaret al-Numan: two minutes from now/ Kafranbel: one minute from now.""
A former English teacher, Abdel Razzaq has been diligently watching planes since 2011, later joining Sentry as an observer.
""We're a bunch of guys who are everywhere. Each of us holds a specific district,"" he said. ""We see the plane, the type of plane, with the naked eye and then send the warning.""
As well as providing warning of attacks that come out of the blue, the system has also helped indicate brief pauses during more sustained attacks, said Hala Systems co-founder Levin. During the offensive on Ghouta, near Damascus, earlier this year, civilians relied on the system to time their brief forays from basements and shelters to get food and water.

""That was a big relief for us, that we were actually having impact even when it's raining bombs,"" Levin said.

1238,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",Hungary's Orban bets on growing anti-immigrant tide in latest EU standoff,"By Krisztina Than
BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The European Parliament's vote to punish Hungary for flouting democratic standards works in Prime Minister Viktor Orban's favor by letting him pose as a champion of national sovereignty against a remote Brussels elite as EU elections loom next year.
His typically feisty performance before EU lawmakers has boosted Orban's standing among nationalists at home and also among anti-immigrant parties that are expected to increase their presence in the next European Parliament (EP).
And with Hungary's regional allies Poland and the Czech Republic offering to shield it against any EU sanctions, Orban's gamble is likely to pay off - although his Fidesz party may end up having to quit the conservative European People's Party (EPP), currently the largest grouping in the Parliament.
In an unprecedented move on Wednesday, more than two thirds of EP lawmakers voted to sanction Hungary due to concerns over Orban's pressuring of courts, the media and non-government groups and his refusal to take in migrants.
Addressing the EP on Tuesday, Orban made clear he would not abandon his hardline stance on the mostly Muslim migrants who have come to Europe since 2015. He has previously said they pose an existential threat to Christian civilization.
Cheered on by far-right parties, Orban said he rejected ""the blackmail, the slander and fraudulent accusations leveled against Hungary and the Hungarian people by the European Parliament's pro-immigration and pro-migrant forces"".
Echoing that line on Thursday, the pro-government daily Magyar Idok said: ""Pro-immigration forces took revenge with a fraud.""
Orban, whose right-wing Fidesz party has governed Hungary since 2010 and was re-elected in April for a third consecutive term on a strongly anti-immigrant platform, is playing a long-term political game in Europe.
""We hope anti-immigration forces could even gain a majority in the European Parliament to be elected in 2019... but at least there will be a strong shift, with the anti-immigration forces gaining ground,"" Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas told a news conference on Thursday.
Fidesz looks likely to perform well. The latest opinion poll, published by pro-government think-tank Szazadveg, put its support at 36 percent in early September, with nationalist opposition party Jobbik second at 8 percent. As in some other EU countries, the center-left has been largely marginalized.
""REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE""
Theoretically, the EP vote could end with Hungary losing its EU voting rights - but both Poland and the Czech Republic vowed on Thursday to veto such a move, saying it would increase voters' dissatisfaction with Europe.
Some analysts cautioned, however, that the EP move against Hungary could erode its attractiveness over time as a target for investment.
""Although we don't see any short-term direct economic consequences from the move, the reputational damage to Hungary and Prime Minister Viktor Orban could affect investment and rating decisions,"" ING analyst Peter Virovacz said in a note.
Orban has often been in conflict with Brussels over his policies but has sometimes tweaked controversial legislation in the past in order to reach a compromise.
His refusal to budge this time cost him support in the EPP conservative grouping, which includes German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, who have criticized some of Orban's policies.
Following Wednesday's vote the EPP may consider whether to eject Fidesz, though that would be a difficult procedure.
Orban said in June he would prefer Fidesz to stay within the grouping and try to reform the EPP from within.
""In relation to the 2019 elections to the European Parliament, it would be easy to, say, establish a new formation from like-minded Central European parties – or, indeed, a pan-European anti-immigration formation,"" he said. 
""Instead of desertion, we should take on the more difficult task of renewing the European People's Party, and helping it to find its way back to its Christian Democratic roots.""
EPP leaders, including Merkel, are due to meet for a dinner in the Austrian city of Salzburg on Sept. 18, the eve of an EU summit, but at this stage no discussion about removing Fidesz is on their agenda, one EPP official said. 
Agoston Mraz, director of Hungary's pro-government think-tank Nezopont, said Orban still did not want to leave the EPP.
""The strategy is that he tries to do something within the EPP. If push comes to shove and they try to squeeze him out, or suspend Fidesz' membership, that would create a new situation,"" Mraz said.

""We will see what the coming months bring.""

The military's Africa Command (Africom) said the strike was carried out on Sept. 11, in the central Somali village of Mubaraak, west of the capital Mogadishu.
""The U.S. airstrike was conducted against an enemy fighting position in self-defense after U.S. and partner forces came under attack,"" Africom said in a statement.

ISTANBUL/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Turkey has said it is working with Russia and Iran to stabilize Syria's rebel-held Idlib region, indicating continued efforts to avoid a Syrian government offensive in the area, where Ankara failed to secure a ceasefire last week.
Damascus, backed by Russia and Iran, has been preparing a major assault to recover the region. The United Nations has warned this could trigger a humanitarian catastrophe in an area where 3 million people live.
Idlib is part of an arc of territory at the Turkish border representing the last major area held by insurgents who have fought President Bashar al-Assad through more than seven years of war. Assad has vowed to recover ""every inch"" of Syria.
Turkey, which backs the anti-Assad opposition, has been warning Assad and his allies against attacking Idlib. It has reinforced 12 military observation posts in the region, and stepped up arms shipments to allied rebels.
But Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar, in comments on Wednesday evening, indicated that there were continued contacts with Russia and Iran for a diplomatic solution.
""We are working intensively with Russia, Iran and our allies for peace and stability to be brought to the region and for a humanitarian tragedy to be prevented,"" he was quoted as saying on Thursday by the state-run news agency Anadolu.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan met with the leaders of Iran and Russia last week in Tehran, but failed to win a ceasefire pledge.
Already hosting 3.5 million Syrians, Turkey says it cannot take in more and has accused the West of abandoning it to the consequences of Assad's reconquest of Syria.
Russian and Syrian warplanes launched waves of air strikes in the northwest last week, killing dozens and uprooting tens of thousands. But activists said there had been a lull.
""For the past three days things have been calm,"" said Abdel Razzaq, a monitor for the Sentry warning service, which operates in opposition-held parts of Syria.
Speaking from where he monitors the skies in Maarat al-Numan, south of Idlib city, he said there had been no air strikes, although some shelling continued on the frontlines.
Syrian Observatory for Human Rights director Rami Abdulrahman said neither Russian nor Syria warplanes had been attacking the area since around midday Monday.
ASSAD ""WANTS MILITARY VICTORY""
Speaking in China, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the international community must mobilize to come up with a humanitarian plan to guarantee access to Idlib.
""The reality is ... that Bashar al-Assad only wants a military victory and has started the offensive to retake the Idlib region with the support of Russia,"" he said. 
The United Nations said it was preparing to give help to 900,000 people who could flee a surge in hostilities. 
Panos Moumtzis, U.N. regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syria crisis, also quoted a Russian official as telling a humanitarian task force in Geneva that ""every effort to find a peaceful solution to the problem is being made at the moment"".
The opposition accuses Russia and its allies of attacking hospitals and civil defense centers to force rebels to surrender in a repeat of earlier, large-scale military offensives in areas such as Aleppo and Eastern Ghouta.

Moumtzis said the U.N. had shared the GPS coordinates of 235 protected sites in Idlib, including schools and hospitals, with Russia, Turkey and the United States in the hope they would not be targeted.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 11:26AM ET</span>","Chinese official says China is educating, not mistreating, Muslims","By Tom Miles and Stephanie Nebehay
GENEVA (Reuters) - China is not mistreating Muslims in Xinjiang province but is putting some people through training courses to avoid extremism spreading, unlike Europe, which had failed to deal with the problem, a Chinese official told reporters on Thursday. 
Reports of mass detentions of ethnic Uighurs and other ethnic Muslims in China's far western region have sparked a growing international outcry, prompting the Trump administration to consider sanctions against officials and companies linked to allegations of human rights abuses.
""It is not mistreatment,"" said Li Xiaojun, director for publicity at the Bureau of Human Rights Affairs of the State Council Information Office. ""What China is doing is to establish professional training centers, educational centers."" 
""If you do not say it’s the best way, maybe it’s the necessary way to deal with Islamic or religious extremism, because the West has failed in doing so, in dealing with religious Islamic extremism,"" Li told reporters on the sidelines of the U.N. Human Rights Council session in Geneva.
""Look at Belgium, look at Paris, look at some other European countries. You have failed.""
China frequently comes under fire for its human rights policies. On Wednesday, it was accused by U.N. chief Antonio Guterres of reprisals against activists, including the alleged torture of a human rights lawyer. Critics say its surveillance in Xinjiang approaches martial law conditions.
""As to surveillance, China is learning from the UK,"" Li said. ""Your per capita CCTV is much higher than that for China's Xinjiang Autonomous Region.""
Europe's top rights court ruled on Thursday that Britain had violated privacy and free speech with a ""Big Brother"" electronic surveillance program.
Li said it was normal practice for Xinjiang police to use closed-circuit television for the public good, especially after ethnic riots in 2009, which were blamed on ""foreign forces"". 
He said the Xinjiang education centers were not ""detention centers or re-education camps"", which he dismissed as ""the trademark product of eastern European countries"", an apparent reference to Soviet Gulag detention camps during the Cold War.
""To put it straight, it’s like vocational training ... like your children go to vocational-training schools to get better skills and better jobs after graduation.
""But these kind of training and education centers only accept people for a short period of time – some people five days, some seven days, 10 days, one month, two months.""
He rejected the idea of having a U.N. expert visit the region, saying there was no need. 
He said the poorest people in remote areas were most susceptible to radicalization, and that mosques were being used to that effect. 
Islam was a good thing in China's view, but Islamic extremists were the common foes of mankind, he said.

""They are very bad elements. You can see that in Afghanistan, in Syria, in Pakistan, in Iraq, and many other countries.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of foreign-born people in the United States grew last year to its highest share in over a century, according to Census Bureau data published on Thursday.
The increase took the number of foreign-born residents to 44.5 million in 2017, up 1.8 percent from a year earlier. 
The administration has said it wants to restrict legal immigration, and has stepped up efforts as well to detain and deport immigrants in the country illegally since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017.
But so far, said Randy Capps, a demographer at the Migration Policy Institute, the government hasn't restricted legal immigration much and America's strong job market likely fueled part of last year's increase in the foreign-born population. 
""The economy's definitely a factor in this, not just in more people coming but in more people staying,"" Capps said. 
Foreign-born residents made up 13.7 percent of the U.S. population in 2017, up from 13.5 percent in 2016, according to the Census Bureau's estimates. That put the proportion of immigrants in the United States last year at the highest since 1910, when they made up 14.7 percent of the population.
The data also showed that an increasing number of immigrants were Asian or had advanced university degrees, extending a trend that has been in place for over a decade during which immigration from Mexico slowed. The share of immigrants from Mexico fell to 25.3 percent last year from 26.5 percent in 2016, while the share from China rose to 6.4 percent from 6.2 percent.
The data comes from the government's annual American Community Survey, which demographers consider the most comprehensive source for estimating the immigrant population.
The survey, also used to gauge demographic trends in cities and counties around the country, counts all foreign-born people but does not distinguish between those in the country legally or illegally. 
Demographers say the survey likely undercounts those in the country illegally. Illegal immigrants can be more difficult for surveyors to locate due to informal living arrangements, and some may avoid being included in surveys for fear of being reported to the government, researchers say. 

Jeffrey Passel, a demographer at Pew Research Center, has estimated that the actual immigrant population is likely 3 percent to 5 percent higher than the number in the Census Bureau's American Community Survey.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has ordered an investigation of an American bishop accused of sexual misconduct with adults and accepted his resignation, deepening a worldwide clerical abuse scandal. 
The Vatican and U.S. Church officials announced the investigation on Thursday as the pope was meeting U.S. Catholic Church leaders to discuss a scandal that has shaken his papacy.
The Vatican said the pope had appointed Archbishop William Lori of Baltimore to run the Wheeling-Charleston diocese, West Virginia, until Bishop Michael J. Bransfield is replaced.
There were no details on the specific allegations against Bransfield and neither he nor his legal representatives could immediately be reached for comment.
The Catholic Church worldwide is reeling from crises involving sexual abuse of minors, deeply damaging confidence in the Church in the United States, Chile, Australia, and Ireland where the scandal has hit hardest, and elsewhere
In the United States alone, the Church spent about $4 billion in compensation and other costs related to the priest sex abuse crisis between 1950 and 2015, according to the National Catholic Reporter.
The advocacy group BishopAccountability.org says Church data shows that 6,721 clerics have been ""not implausibly"" or ""credibly"" accused of sexually abusing minors in the United States between 1950 and 2016 and that there were about 18,500 victims.
In Germany, a Church study published in a magazine on Wednesday showed 1,670 clerics and priests had sexually abused 3,677 minors, mostly males, in the country between 1946 and 2014.
PAPAL ORDER
On Thursday, the archdiocese of Baltimore's website said the pope had ordered the archbishop to investigate allegations of sexual harassment of adults by Bransfield.
""My primary concern is for the care and support of the priests and people of the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston at this difficult time,"" Lori said in a statement.
""I further pledge to conduct a thorough investigation in search of the truth into the troubling allegations against Bishop Bransfield and to work closely with the clergy, religious and lay leaders of the diocese until the appointment of a new bishop,"" he said.
The announcement of Bransfield's resignation came while the pope was meeting Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston, and Archbishop José Horacio Gómez of Los Angeles.
In a statement afterwards, DiNardo said they told the pope of ""our situation in the United States -- how the Body of Christ is lacerated by the evil of sexual abuse."" He called the meeting ""a lengthy, fruitful, and good exchange"".
DiNardo had asked for the meeting after Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano last month accused the pope of knowing for years about sexual misconduct by former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick and of doing nothing about it.
In July, McCarrick became the first cardinal to resign in nearly 100 years after American Church officials said allegations that he had sexually abused a 16-year-old boy almost 50 years ago were credible and substantiated.
DEMANDING ANSWERS
McCarrick has said that he had ""absolutely no recollection"" of the alleged abuse of the teenager but has not commented on the other allegations against him.
DiNardo has called for the Vatican to launch an investigation, known as an ""apostolic visitation,"" into how McCarrick could have risen steadily through the ranks of the U.S. Church although many people knew that he had engaged for years in sexual misconduct with adult male seminarians.
In the 11-page statement published on Aug. 26, Vigano, the former Vatican ambassador to Washington, launched an unprecedented broadside by a Church insider against the pope and a long list of Vatican and U.S. Church officials.

DiNardo has said Vigano's accusations ""deserve answers that are conclusive and based on evidence"".

1244,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 11:01AM ET</span>","France pushes year-end vote for Libya despite doubts in Italy, Tripoli","PARIS (Reuters) - France stuck to its position pushing for elections in Libya by the end of the year on Thursday, a day after Italy and the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli sowed doubts on the electoral calendar, citing a worsening security situation.
Former colonial power Italy and France have been competing for influence in war-torn Libya, rich in oil and gas and a staging post for people smugglers who have launched tens of thousands of migrants across the Mediterranean sea toward Europe in past years.
Libya splintered following the 2011 NATO-backed revolt that toppled Muammar Gaddafi, and since 2014 has been divided between competing political and military groups based in Tripoli and the east.
Seeking to end the turmoil, French President Emmanuel Macron hosted a conference in May where rival Libyan factions agreed to work with the United Nations for a national election by Dec. 10.
On Wednesday, Prime Minister Fayez Seraj, who had agreed to the roadmap, said conditions in his country were too unstable to hold elections.
Those comments were echoed by Italy's Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi who was quoted by state news agency as saying the date should be reconsidered. 
""We are in disagreement with the position of the French government, which, as was decided in Paris, says the elections in Libya must be held on December 10,"" he said.
In response to those doubts, France's foreign ministry said it was convinced of the need for a political solution based on the Paris agreements.
""France will continue with its partners to support the efforts of the Libyan authorities and the United Nations to ensure the continuation of the political process and in particular the conditions for holding elections by the end of the year,"" spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll told reporters in a daily briefing.
Italy has close relations with the authorities in Tripoli and is the only Western country to have reopened its embassy in the Libyan capital, home to Serraj's U.N.-brokered transitional government.

France is seen as closer to military commander Khalifa Haftar, who is aligned with a rival government based in the east.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Parliament urged Cambodia on Thursday to drop all charges against opposition leader Kem Sokha, deepening the international outcry over his detainment.
On Monday, Sokha was moved to house arrest in the capital, Phnom Penh, after spending more than a year in jail on treason charges. He was arrested last September as part of a government-led crackdown against critics.
Last year, Cambodia's democracy made ""significant steps backward,"" said Federica Mogherini, vice president of the European Commission, during a debate in Parliament.
The resolution passed in Parliament called on EU bodies to look into the possibility of sanctioning Cambodian officials over human and civil rights violations.
The vote by European lawmakers comes after the United States earlier this week urged the Cambodian government to drop all charges against Sokha. 
Sokha, 65, is the leader of the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), which was dissolved as part of the crackdown ahead of a general election in July.
""The decision to dissolve the CNRP was a significant step towards the creation of an authoritarian state,"" the resolution passed by EU lawmakers stated. 
""The political structure of Cambodia can no longer be considered a democracy,"" the document said.
Long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won all 125 parliamentary seats in the election, which the United Nations and some Western countries have said was flawed because of the lack of a credible opposition, among other factors.
Restrictions placed on Sokha include a ban on him meeting CNRP officials or the media.
Cambodian government spokesman Phay Siphan said the conditions of Kem Sokha's bail were decided by the court.

ADEN (Reuters) - Yemeni forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition seized the main road linking the port city of Hodeidah to the capital Sanaa, blocking a supply route for the Houthi group that controls both cities, military sources and residents said on Thursday.
The Western-backed alliance in Yemen resumed its offensive after the collapse of peace talks on Saturday which the United Nations had hoped would avert an assault on the Red Sea city, the country's main port and a lifeline for millions of Yemenis, and start a process to end the three-year war.
""The situation has deteriorated dramatically in the past few days. Families are absolutely terrified by the bombardment, shelling and airstrikes,"" U.N. humanitarian coordinator Lise Grande said in a statement on Thursday.
The coalition of Sunni Muslim states led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates has said taking control of Hodeidah would force the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement to the negotiating table by cutting off its main supply line.
""The main entrance in Hodeidah leading to Sanaa has been closed after forces backed by the UAE took control of the road,"" a pro-coalition military source told Reuters.
Residents said the main eastern gate had been damaged in air strikes by coalition warplanes and that fighting was continuing on secondary streets off the main road.
There is another more circuitous route between Hodeidah on the western coast of Yemen to the capital in the north.
The United Nations fears an attack on Hodeidah, the entrypoint for the bulk of Yemen's commercial imports and aidsupplies, could lead to a famine in the impoverished country where an estimated 8.4 million people are facing starvation.
Grande said people in Hodeidah are struggling to survive.
""More than 25 percent of children are malnourished; 900,000 people in the governorate are desperate for food and 90,000 pregnant women are at enormous risk."" 
CHILDREN AT RISK
The coalition accuses the Houthis of smuggling weapons and has imposed stringent measures on imports through Hodeidah.
Any interruption of supplies from the port would have an impact on the wider population in the nation of 28 million, including more than 11 million children facing the threat of food shortages, disease and displacement.
An estimated 1.8 million children are malnourished, according to Meritxell Relano, UNICEF representative in Yemen. 
""The conflict has made Yemen a living hell for its children,"" she told Reuters.
In a Sanaa hospital, a malnutrition ward has been set up to treat children, many under the age of 2. The toddlers, with protruding rib cages, are among hundreds of thousands of children suffering from acute malnutrition. 
The alliance intervened in Yemen's war, widely seen as a proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran, in 2015 to restore the internationally recognized government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
It launched an offensive on Hodeidah in June in an effort to bring the Houthis to their knees, but halted it after almost no gains to give U.N.-sponsored peace talks a chance.
The renewed fighting will put pressure on U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths, who promised to press ahead with diplomacy after an attempt to hold peace talks in Geneva was abandoned on Saturday when the Houthi delegation failed to show up.
The Houthis accused the coalition of blocking the group's team from traveling, while Hadi's government accused the movement of trying to sabotage the negotiations.
A Saudi woman was injured by an artillery shell in the region of Najran, near the Yemeni border, Saudi state TV reported on Thursday, giving no further details.

Houthi-controlled Masirah TV reported earlier that the group shelled the border region of Jaafan.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish lawmakers on Thursday voted to remove the remains of dictator Francisco Franco from a mausoleum where tens of thousands of victims of the 1936-39 civil war that brought him to power are also laid to rest.
The bill had the backing of the ruling socialists, leftist Podemos and smaller regional parties and passed with 176 votes in favor, but there were 165 abstentions and two against. 
The Valley of the Fallen site near Madrid was described by a senior Podemos leader last month as ""the last standing monument to fascist dictatorship in Europe"". 
But the plans to move Franco's remains have divided Spanish society. Several of his descendants issued a statement last month expressing their ""firm and unanimous"" opposition to the exhumation.
The statement said the family hoped the Benedictine order in charge of the site, which is marked by a 152 meter (500 ft)-tall cross, would prevent the state's ""vengefulness"".
The government of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez hopes Franco's exhumation will help settle grievances from the period of his rule that still cast a shadow over the country.
""It's about time,"" Nicolas Sanchez-Albornoz, 92, who worked on the construction of the mausoleum after being sentenced in the 1940s to six years' forced labor for student activism against the Franco regime, told Reuters.
""Spanish society has evolved. The government won't be able to change its mind now.""
Sanchez-Albornoz escaped in 1948 with the help of colleagues in France before fleeing to Argentina. He permanently returned to Madrid in 1991.
""Every time I drive past, I look up to see if the cross is still there,"" he said.
As many as 500,000 combatants and civilians died in the Spanish civil war. During Franco's 1939-1975 rule, tens of thousands of his opponents were killed or imprisoned.
Past political crimes were pardoned as part of Spain's transition to democracy in the late 1970s, fostering resentment among some families of victims.

Many hope to win permission to unearth remains of war dead at the Valley of the Fallen and in dozens of unmarked graves throughout the country, and give their loved ones what they consider a proper burial.

The SNP has been heartened by new polls showing a rise in support for secession as confidence in a Brexit deal which works for Scotland declines, deputy leader Keith Brown said. 
Its members will canvas people across Scotland on Sept. 29 ahead of an SNP conference on Oct. 7.
Scots rejected independence 55 to 45 percent in a 2014 referendum, and since then support for secession has barely moved.
But a Deltapoll survey earlier this month found Brexit could tip public opinion in Scotland toward independence, with 47 percent of Scots said to be in favor of independence, 43 percent against and 10 percent who did not know.
In Britain's 2016 referendum, Scots voted to stay in the EU but Britain as a whole voted to leave and Brexit is set to happen on March 29 2019.
""This day of action ... is moving the SNP onto a campaign footing,"" Brown said in a statement. ""We are building a fresh case for independence and we are also campaign-ready for any possible snap general election.""
""The (nationwide) parties are riddled with division and on the brink of implosion over Brexit - meanwhile our party and the independence movement have our sights on a far more positive future for Scotland as an independent country,"" he added.
The SNP has 125,000 members, making it the second-biggest political party in Britain after the Labour Party, even though Scotland only has 3.95 million of Britain's 46.1 million electorate and the Conservative Party runs Britain's government.

The Guards fired seven missiles at the headquarters of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), an armed opposition group that fights for greater autonomy for Iran’s Kurdish community. 
Iranian media said at least 11 people were killed.
""The attack against the terrorists in Iraq's Kurdistan conveys a message to the enemies, particularly those superpowers who think they can impose their evil plots on Iran and bully us,"" state TV quoted Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari as saying.
Iran has repeatedly threatened to destroy U.S. military bases across the Middle East and target Israel within minutes if attacked by the United States and its regional allies. 
""All those who have forces, bases and equipment within a 2,000 km (1,200 mile) radius should know that our missiles are highly precise.""
Israel sees Iran's regional influence and involvement in conflicts from Yemen to Syria as a threat to Israel's own existence. 
The tension between Tehran and Washington, foes for decades, has heightened since May, when President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a 2015 international nuclear deal with Tehran. 
France's Foreign Ministry ""strongly condemned"" the missile strikes and said it was worried by Iran's activities, notably its missile development.
In August, Washington reimposed sanctions on the acquisition of U.S. dollars by Iran, and its trade in gold and precious metals. The sanctions were among those lifted under the deal in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear program. 
In November, heavier U.S. sanctions are expected on Iran’s oil sector, a lifeline of its economy. Washington has urged Iran's oil buyers to cut their imports of Iranian crude to zero. Iran has denounced the call as ""nonsense"". 

The European Union, China and Russia, all parties to the nuclear pact, are working to maintain trade with Iran, which has threatened to stop complying with curbs on its nuclear work if it fails to see the economic benefits of relief from sanctions under the deal.

Broadcaster AS TV was fined by the Turkish Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTUK) over the video for ""Secrets"", which it said ""featured erotic dance figures of a homosexual nature"" and was shown during hours when children and young people could watch and be negatively influenced.
The video features some same sex couples dancing, sometimes suggestively, against a graffiti wall. Grammy-award winning singer Pink has scored hits like ""What About Us"" and ""Raise Your Glass"" over a 20-year career.
The television channel was fined 17,000 Turkish liras for the clip. AS TV is a local television channel broadcasting in the industrial western city of Bursa.
The watchdog has in the past fined broadcasters over an array of issues, including kissing scenes and adult language in television shows, and in March was granted the authority to also supervise and manage online content in the country.
In January, RTUK fined a TV station nearly 1 million lira ($155,000) over footage of young girls, aged from seven to 11, dancing in shorts in a talent competition after viewers complained of ""child abuse"".

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and its supporters were far more active and adept than mainstream parties in promoting their agenda on social media in the run-up to last year's election success, a report published on Thursday shows.
The nationalist, anti-immigration party won seats in the national parliament for the first time in September, with 12.6 percent of the vote, after generating more engagement for its message on Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) than its opponents.
Half of the retweeted messages during the campaign were about the AfD, and its Facebook posts were shared five times more than those of any other party, according to the biggest study yet of online activity ahead of the Sept. 2017 election. (Click https://www.ub.tum.de/tumuniversitypress/titel/social-media-report-2017-german-federal-elections for a link to the study)
Now, as regional elections loom this autumn in Bavaria and Hesse, the party is gaining further traction with relentless posting on issues such as crime committed by migrants, which is widely shared by its supporters.
""They use very aggressive and polarizing messages - that causes people to react more,"" said Juan Carlos Medina Serrano of the Technical University of Munich's political data science team, which wrote the report.
The AfD, together with far-right fringe groups, was quick to join protests over the fatal stabbing of a man in the eastern city of Chemnitz last month, for which two asylum seekers from Iraq and Syria were arrested.
It has also hammered away at the issue on social media: ""Chemnitz has been in the top 10 hashtags in Germany for the last two weeks,"" Medina Serrano said.
SUPPORT STILL RISING
Despite condemnation from mainstream parties and commentators for marching alongside neo-Nazis, the AfD has raised its national support into the mid- to high teens, recent surveys suggest.
AfD spokesman Michael Pfalzgraf said the party used social media to communicate with supporters and understand their concerns to help it formulate its political demands.
He declined to give details on its social media budget, but said a big part of its social media work was done by volunteers.
As with the U.S. presidential election of 2016, there have been concerns that voters in Germany are being influenced by 'fake' news, but the 60-page study found that the spread of such disinformation was not significant.
Of a sample of 350 million tweets gathered over seven months before the general election, none of the 100 most-shared messages contained fake news - but 51 of them were related to the AfD.
On Facebook, meanwhile, nine of the 100 most shared stories were found to have been sensationalist, one-sided and aimed at triggering negative emotions toward refugees, but were not demonstrably false. ""This is insufficient to categorize them as fake news,"" the study said.
RETWEETING
Instead, the researchers found that AfD supporters amplified the reach of media coverage of stories that the AfD posted or commented on. Social media users sympathetic to the party often tweeted links to stories in Die Welt, a conservative daily, but also to fringe alt-right media outlets.
These included far-right news sites such as Junge Freiheit and the German edition of the Epoch Times, which is controlled by exiled devotees of China's Falun Gong sect and takes an editorial line close to that of the AfD.
Also popular are Russian-run news sites Sputnik and RT Deutsch that portray the AfD in a positive light. There was not much evidence of activity by Russian 'troll' accounts suspected of attempting to manipulate the U.S. election, however.
On the national and regional Facebook pages of Germany's main political parties, the AfD's Facebook page had the biggest number of hits, and its posts were shared five times more than those of its nearest rival.
And, while readers' emoji responses to other parties' Facebook posts mostly indicated that they loved them or found them funny, those responding to AfD posts were most likely to choose the emoji for 'angry'.

FORT BENNING, Georgia (Reuters) - Inside the gates of the U.S. Army's Fort Benning, the din of power tools blared this week. Maintenance workers wearing respirators were busy removing old and potentially toxic paint from homes. Plastic tarps surrounded cordoned-off housing, with signs reading, ""CAUTION POISON"" and ""LEAD HAZARD AREA.""
The activity is part of a larger effort, on Army posts around the world, to respond to residents' lead poisoning concerns after a Reuters report last month uncovered lead hazards lurking on U.S. bases. (Read the Reuters Special Report, 'Children poisoned by lead on U.S. Army bases' https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-military-housing/)
The article documented the risks of lead-based paint exposure in older and mostly privatized Army housing across several states, and found that more than 1,050 small children tested high for lead on U.S. bases in recent years. Army clinics often were failing to report high test results to state health authorities as required.
The report prompted a call for action by members of the U.S. Congress. Some 700,000 Americans, including approximately 100,000 small children, live in family housing on military posts across the United States.
Defense Secretary James Mattis told reporters the Army's duty to provide safe housing to military families was a ""moral obligation."" Within a week, the Army drafted plans to test 40,000 older homes for lead, and to remove families from homes when necessary. The inspection efforts could cost as much as $386 million, Reuters reported last month. (See the report https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-military-cleanup-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-army-forms-plan-to-test-40000-homes-for-lead-following-reuters-report-idUSKCN1LC1ZH)
""We have developed and are executing enhanced protocols for screening the interiors of homes, sampling potable tap water, and testing soil samples to identify, mitigate and correct potential hazards,"" Army spokeswoman Colonel Kathleen Turner wrote in a statement Wednesday.
All Army installations worldwide with family housing are conducting town hall meetings to address residents' concerns, she said.
A visit to Fort Benning shows the broad response underway. At several old homes, signs have been posted saying, ""New windows coming soon."" Old lead paint sloughing from window areas can be hazardous to children.
Some families have been moved, and others residing in older homes are having their drinking water tested. Fort Benning's clinic has been holding walk-in lead testing to accommodate a rush of children being screened.
Villages of Benning, the public-private consortium that manages the Georgia base's family housing, is planning to certify 60 additional staff to respond to lead-based paint concerns before next month, a six-fold increase, according to Army documents reviewed by Reuters. Earlier, Reuters tested five Benning homes and found lead paint hazards in all of them.
When properly maintained, old lead paint isn't considered dangerous, but when it deteriorates it becomes a hazard.
At Fort Benning, some residents aren't waiting for the Army. On a private Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group where families discuss military housing concerns, residents are posting photos of store-bought consumer lead-testing swabs and sharing results.
QUICKER FIXES, NEW CONCERNS
One resident, Stephanie Campbell, told Reuters she had reported lead hazards when she moved into her historic home over a year ago. Her first lead-related maintenance requests took months to resolve, she said. But another request she made last month was addressed within weeks. 
""They are being more responsive,"" said Campbell, who lives on base with her husband and year-old daughter.
Four neighbors on her street have recently been moved out of their homes or have moves scheduled, she said, pending lead remediation activities.
A new worry has emerged: lead in the drinking water at some homes. Campbell decided to get her water checked and scheduled testing with Columbus Water Works, the region's public utility company, which offers the service free of charge. Her results, reviewed by Reuters, indicated multiple taps with lead levels above the level at which the Environmental Protection Agency recommends action, 15 parts per billion.
Columbus Water Works has seen a spike in lead testing requests from Benning residents, said Vic Burchfield, a senior vice president at the Georgia utility. At least 34 Benning families have asked for testing. Of 15 homes tested so far, six had at least one tap with lead above the safety action level. Screening detected lead at lower levels in four others.
The utility plans to replace water service lines for the 10 homes where testing detected lead so far, Burchfield said, ""out of an abundance of caution."" He added that the company believes the service lines - the pipes linking homes to main water lines - are safe from lead, and that the toxin is likely leaching from indoor plumbing or fixtures. 
A Benning town hall forum is scheduled for Friday. At other such meetings this week, on posts including Fort Hood in Texas and Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Army public health personnel sought to reassure residents that the risks of lead poisoning are usually low on Army installations, and the rate of children who test high for the toxin is often below that found in civilian communities.

In Congress, two amendments to the 2019 defense funding bill, sponsored by Georgia Republican Senator Johnny Isakson and Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, would mandate a federal review of lead paint in all military housing and set aside funding for lead blood testing of military children. The amendments passed the Senate in August.

Twenty children, most under the age of two, being treated at the ward in Sab'een Hospital are among hundreds of thousands of children suffering from severe malnutrition in the impoverished country that has been ravaged by a more than three years of war.
""The conflict has made Yemen a living hell for its children,"" Meritxell Relano, UNICEF Representative in Yemen, told Reuters.
She said more than 11 million children, or about 80 percent of the country's population under the age of 18, were facing the threat of food shortages, disease, displacement and acute lack of access to basic social services.
""An estimated 1.8 million children are malnourished in the country. Nearly 400,000 of them are severely acute malnourished and they are fighting for their lives every day.""
A coalition of Sunni Muslim Arab states, led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, intervened in Yemen's war in 2015 against the Iranian-aligned Houthis after they drove the internationally recognized government out of the capital Sanaa. 
The war has unleashed the world's most urgent humanitarian crisis in the nation of 28 million, where 8.4 million people are believed to be on the verge of starvation and 22 million people are dependent on aid.
The coalition has imposed stringent measures on imports into Yemen to prevent the Houthis from smuggling weapons but the checks have slowed the flow of commercial goods and vital aid into the country.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE say they are providing funds and supplies to support aid efforts in Yemen. The Houthis blame the coalition for choking off imports into the country. 
In Sab'een hospital a toddler in diapers lay wrapped in blankets with a tube inserted in the child's nose. Another child cried while being lowered naked unto a scale to be weighed.
The families of the children declined to speak to the media.
""The situation of the families without jobs, without income and in the middle of the war, is catastrophic,"" Relano said.
She said UNICEF had provided more than 244,000 severely malnourished children under the age of five with therapeutic treatment since the beginning of 2018, in addition to micronutrient treatment to over 317,000 children under five.
""The human cost and the humanitarian impact of this conflict is unjustifiable,"" U.N. humanitarian coordinator Lise Grande said in a statement on Thursday. 

""Parties to the conflict are obliged to do absolutely everything possible to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure and ensure people have access to the aid they are entitled to and need to survive.""'

The man, wanted by the Swiss authorities, was captured in an operation by the national security service, border police and prosecutors at the Kapitan Andreevo border check point on Sept. 11 and charged the following day, prosecutors said.
During the search of his Swiss-registered SUV, police found three rifles, a pistol, more than 400 rounds of ammunition and at least 24 knives. They also founded a map with a route that ended in Syria's northern Idlib province.
The prosecutors did not reveal the man's name. They said his father had alerted the Swiss authorities that he was missing along with the SUV, weapons and ammunition. They quoted the suspect as saying he wanted to go help civilians in Syria.
Idlib and parts of a few neighboring provinces form the last major stronghold in Syria of opponents of President Bashar al-Assad, and government forces have threatened to launch a major offensive to capture the area.

Damascus, which took back the crossing from the opposition, hopes to reopen the Nassib route vital to its hopes of reviving Syria's shattered economy and rebuilding in territory under its control.Amman also hopes the opening of the border crossing will reactivate billions of dollars of annual transit trade between Europe and Gulf markets across Syria.
The source told Reuters a technical committee from the two countries held their first meeting on the border crossing on Wednesday to begin discussions on the practical arrangements from customs to security needed to reopen the crossing.
""The meetings will continue to put a complete view of all the arrangements linked to reopening the crossings in the coming period,"" the source said.
Another Jordanian official said the crossing could open by the end of this year. 
The closure of the crossing has also weighted on Lebanese exporters who used it to export hundreds of millions of dollars of produce and goods to lucrative Gulf markets.
Jordan's private sector are also pinning hopes of a revival in bilateral trade in a major neighboring market where Jordanian business have long standing ties.
The Syrian government has recovered control of most of the country with help from its allies Russia and Iran.

The European Court of Human Rights, based in Strasbourg, eastern France, did not question the existence of the spying program in itself but said a lack of oversight and safeguards meant it undermined rights to privacy and free expression.
The court gave Britain, which is in the process of altering legislation on an issue publicly exposed by U.S. whistleblower Edward Snowden, three months to decide whether to request an appeal hearing after Thursday's ruling.
""While the Court was satisfied that the intelligence services of the United Kingdom take their (European human rights) Convention obligations seriously and are not abusing their powers, it found that there was inadequate independent oversight of the selection and search processes involved in the operation,"" the court said in a statement.
The violations concerned in particular shortcomings when it came to selecting the Internet service providers involved, as well as the search criteria used to filter and select intercepted communications for assessment.
""Furthermore, there were no real safeguards applicable to the selection of related communications data for examination, even though this data could reveal a great deal about a person's habits and contacts,"" the court statement said.
By related communications, the court said it meant the collection of details like who calls who, from where and when -- rather than the content of the communications.
The cases are the latest legal challenge to the UK in a long-running spy scandal following revelations by Snowden, a former U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) contractor whose revelations in 2013 renewed debate over privacy versus security.
Among the more than one dozen groups that took the case to Strasbourg were the London-based Big Brother Watch organization, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and former Guardian reporter Alice Ross.
They said Britain's activities -- many of them run from GCHQ (Government Communications Headquarters), a vast intelligence gathering center in Cheltenham -- could threaten the privacy of journalists, who may fear their contact lists or the websites they visit are being scrutinized by the government.
""Such data enables intrusion into the most intimate aspects of a person's daily life,"" Dinah Rose, one of the applicants' lawyers, told the court in hearings last year.

The British government's counsel, James Eadie, said at that time the programs were necessary in the fight against terrorism.

LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Parliament was expected to confirm Prime Minister Marjan Sarec's center-left coalition as Slovenia's first minority government on Thursday, following an inconclusive general election.
Sarec, a former provincial mayor, comedian and actor, became prime minister-designate last month after the center-right Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) failed to forge a coalition despite winning most votes in June's election. 
""We have proved that we can talk ... now it is time to start working... and deliver results,"" Sarec, 40, told parliament ahead of the vote.
The new government would be ""a guarantee for a stable economic environment that is kind to investment"". He added improving the national health system and cutting red tape would be priorities.
His List of Marjan Sarec (LMS) party is in coalition with four other center-left parties: the Social Democrats, the Party of the Modern Centre, the Party of Alenka Bratusek and the pensioners' party Desus.
They account for 43 of parliament's 90 seats. The opposition Left party, which has nine seats, has pledged to support the minority government on key policies.
Outgoing premier Miro Cerar will be foreign minister, replacing Karl Erjavec who becomes defense minister. Economist Andrej Bertoncelj takes the finance portfolio.
Analysts say the minority government might struggle to stay in power for a full four-year term.

Otilia Dhand, senior vice president of US advisory firm Teneo Intelligence, said the coalition parities had disparate priorities so there was a high risk the coalition could collapse and spark early elections.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A group of Indian Catholic nuns staged are staging a rare street protest in the southern state of Kerala demanding justice after an alleged sexual assault of a nun by a bishop.
Police have called the bishop named in the complaint for a second round of questioning next week. The bishop has denied wrongdoing.
The case comes at a time when the Christian community, which accounts for 19 percent of the state's population, is reeling under an erosion of trust as sexual abuse cases involving the clergy pile up.
Five priests were arrested last month in two different sexual assault cases, while last year, a Catholic priest who was trying to flee the country was arrested after a minor he is accused of having sex with gave birth.
The nun in a letter said she wanted the Vatican to intervene. She said she was forced to make matters public after several attempts to seek justice from within the church failed.
The protest, now in its sixth day in Kochi, Kerala's financial hub, is gathering momentum as the locals, activists, writers and politicians come out in support.
A man, who is on an indefinite hunger strike, lay in front of the stage where the protesting nuns sat. A nun coordinating the protest dismissed allegations that they were trying to disgrace the church.
""Our fight is for the truth. We will not back out unless the truth is established and the nun is given justice,"" she told Reuters.
The Catholic Church in Germany acknowledged a ""depressing and shameful"" legacy of sexual abuse on Wednesday after a leaked study said clerics had abused thousands of children over 70 years.
The leaked study was published on the day that Pope Francis, who has made several attempts to tackle a spreading sexual abuse crisis that has badly tarnished the Church's image worldwide, summoned senior bishops from around the world to the Vatican to discuss the protection of minors.

The demonstrators were protesting over a fatal stabbing blamed on migrants that set off the worse far-right violence in decades, exposing deep divisions over Chancellor Angela Merkel's liberal immigration policies.
The district court in the eastern city sentenced the 33-year-old to an 8-month suspended sentence and ordered him to pay a fine of 2,000 euros ($2,325). A court spokesman also said the man had been put on probation for three years.
The man was also found guilty of attempting to physically harm a policeman who had approached him after he had raised his arm in a Hitler salute, illegal under Germany's post-World War Two constitution, during the protest two weeks ago.
The man had taken part in a march through Chemnitz on Sept. 1 organized by the anti-Islam PEGIDA group and the Alternative for Germany (AfD) far-right party that went largely peacefully. Leftist protesters held their own counter-demonstration.
The sturdy bearded man walked into the court room wearing a blue jacket and jeans and said no word as he walked past journalists before the verdict was delivered behind closed doors. His name was not made public under German privacy rules.
Right-wing radicals have clashed with police, chased people they deemed to be migrants, and attacked a Jewish restaurant in Chemnitz after authorities named a Syrian and an Iraqi as the main suspects in the stabbing of a German man late in August.
The head of Germany's domestic intelligence agency has faced calls to resign after he said he was unsure videos circulating online showing far-right radicals hounding migrants in Chemnitz were real.
A second man is also expected to appear in court this week on similar charges.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A tour of a 136-year-old political drama by Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen was cut short in China after some members of the audience in Beijing shouted out at the performers and called for freedom of speech. 
Berlin-based theater company Schaubühne was to kick off two performances of ""An Enemy of the People"", which deals with issues including corruption and manipulation of the masses, in Nanjing in Jiangsu province starting Thursday. 
But the theater canceled the shows, citing ""technical reasons on stage"". 
During the first of three shows at Beijing's National Centre for the Performing Arts last week, some members of the audience stood up during an interactive scene with performers and exclaimed that a lack of freedom of speech is China's biggest problem, a witness said. 
""'The family name of our media is the Party', someone else also shouted,"" the theater-goer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
The Chinese media is regulated by the Communist Party-ruled government, which also exercises tight control over the internet. China maintains a strict censorship regime that bans access to some foreign news outlets, search engines and social media. 
Critics say the high level of control severely restricts freedom of speech, and is an effort to prevent criticism of the Party.
""Long live freedom!"" someone in the audience shouted during the interactive scene on the second night in Beijing, two theatre-goers told Reuters, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
Some reviews of the play that had circulated on China's social media have since disappeared. Even a Weibo post by the Jiangsu Art Centre expressing its excitement over the staging of the play in Nanjing has been deleted. 
A spokeswoman for the Berlin theater company confirmed that the play had indeed been called off but did not elaborate.
The play tells the story of Thomas Stockmann who fought to expose corruption in a case of water contamination in his town, but was later treated as a public enemy as the town turned on him, fearing for the local economy. 
Ibsen has been influential in Chinese literary circles for nearly a century, and his plays have been popular for highlighting social problems. 
Besides the cancellation of the Nanjing leg, a planned salon discussion on Ibsen and modern theater has also been canned, according to co-organizer Goethe Institut China in a statement. 
""I received a phone call from Jiangsu theater staff who told me that the play is off and they will return me my money as soon as possible,"" said a user on Weibo. 

""As compensation, the theater will give out a folk music show ticket.""

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday unveiled an 8 billion-euro ($9.3 billion) anti-poverty plan focused on getting people into work and helping the young.
With his popularity slumping, the former investment banker wants to convince voters that his reform agenda does not only benefit the wealthy. Opponents have dubbed him a ""president of the rich"", a tag that has hurt his image.
The president announced compulsory school or vocational training until the age of 18, extra crèche places to help mothers return to work, more emergency accommodation with a priority for women and children, and breakfast at school for primary school students in the poorest areas.
""I don't want a plan that leaves the poor living in poverty, only more comfortably,"" Macron said in a speech at the Museum of Mankind in Paris. 
Nearly 9 million people in France - a third of them children - live in poverty, defined as 60 percent of the median income. That is equivalent to 14 percent of the population.
Macron also promised reform of the social benefits system, after causing a stir in June when he said that although France continued to ""plow a wad of cash"" into benefits, people remained poor.
He said he would simplify a system that is so complex that one in three people without an income and eligible for core benefits do not apply. 
""Our welfare model, even if it corrects a little, even if it allows some to live better, does not do enough to prevent people falling into poverty, does not do enough to eradicate poverty,"" Macron said. 
WHY ARE WE LIVING LIKE THIS?
Macron's opponents and left-wing voters paint the 40-year-old as a Thatcherite-in-disguise who talks down the poor. 
His poll ratings have tumbled since his election victory in May 2017 and he is less popular than his three predecessors at the same stage of his presidential term. 
Some critics were swift to point out the gap between the 8 billion euros promised for the anti-poverty plan over four years and the 20 billion the rich will gain in the same period from the scrapping of the wealth tax.
Sambou Coucoure hopes to be one beneficiary of Macron's anti-poverty drive. The former technician quit his job 10 years ago because of back pain. Depression caused his wife to stop working as a care worker, leaving them dependent on benefits worth 1,300 euros a month.
Since March, the couple and their three children have lived in emergency accommodation, two six-metre-square hotel rooms with a sink and microwave.

""We have to buy takeout food because we can't cook,"" 50-year-old Sambou said. ""We never thought it would come to this for our family. As a French citizen, I can't see why we live in conditions like these.""

The public inquiry, which is being telecast live, is reviewing allegations that three Gupta brothers unduly influenced Zuma regarding political appointments and the awarding of government contracts.
Zuma says the three brothers - Atul, Ajay and Rajesh who headed a large conglomerate with assets ranging from mining to media in South Africa - are his friends but he denies any influence-peddling in their relationship. 
The Guptas have also denied any wrongdoing.
The brothers, whose whereabouts abroad are not known, made representations through their lawyers to cross-examine witnesses that have made allegations about them at the public hearings.
The inquiry, led by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, was set up on the recommendation of a 2016 report, entitled ""State of Capture"", into alleged influence-peddling in Zuma’s administration by the Public Protector, South Africa’s main anti-corruption authority.
The 2016 report and other scandals surrounding Zuma’s nine-year rule forced him out of office in February.
Zondo said he would not give the Guptas special treatment.
""There is no lawful or valid reason for the Guptas not being prepared to return to South Africa and give evidence at this commission,"" he said in a ruling. Zondo said he had no problem granting them permission to cross-examine witnesses if they were prepared to testify on South African soil.
Zondo also rejected a request by the Guptas to have the inquiry hold its sessions in a foreign country, and another that they be allowed to give evidence by video link. 
The Guptas have said they feared arrest if they returned to South Africa.
South Africa's chief prosecutor declared Ajay Gupta a ""fugitive from justice"" in February after he failed to hand himself in to police.
The Guptas' lawyers could not be reached for comment on Thursday.
Testifying earlier at the inquiry, former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas said one of the Guptas threatened to kill him if he spoke about a meeting at which they offered him money and the post of finance minister.
In his ruling on Thursday, Zondo gave Zuma's son, Duduzane, the right to cross-examine witnesses. Dudazane has said he would testify at the hearings.
Zondo also asked Zuma to testify at the hearings as he had been referred to in critical ways by some witnesses.
In a speech at a university on Wednesday, Zuma said he did not believe in the notion of ""state capture"", calling it ""a politically-decorated expression"". 

""We have a commission that is sitting investigating the state capture. Is the state captured?,"" Zuma said ""There's no state that is captured... the judiciary is not captured. Is parliament captured? Is the executive captured? So where is this state capture?"" Zuma said.

A total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level officials of the fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), and their associates, the U.S. Justice department has said.
The fund, founded by Najib, is at the center of money-laundering probes in at least six countries, including Singapore Switzerland and the United States.
Police are recording statements of those who received funds from Najib's personal account, among them some with political affiliations and foreigners, said deputy police chief Noor Rashid Ibrahim. 
""We are in the process of taking their statements,"" Noor Rashid told a news conference. Asked if any of the 50 would be charged in the investigation, he replied, ""There is a possibility.""
Reuters could not immediately reach a spokesman for Najib to seek comment.
A total of 132 money laundering transactions have been identified and further investigations are being pursued, the police said in a statement later.
Police added that statements have been taken from 64 people, including Najib and his daughter Nooryana Najwa Najib, with more to come, as they track down those involved, or persons of interest, in the scandal.
Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, have been barred from leaving Malaysia after his decade in power ended in a shock election defeat in May, and the new prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, relaunched an investigation into the troubled fund.
The scandal erupted in 2015 after media reports that about $681 million was deposited into Najib's bank account. 
Najib has consistently denied any wrongdoing, maintaining the funds were donations from a Saudi royal and the bulk handed back.
Noor Rashid said a total of $972 million went into Najib's account, however, after moving through accounts linked to several companies, some of which he named as Good Star Limited, Aabar and Tanore. 
Malaysian and global investigations, including chargesheets filed by the U.S. DoJ, have identified these firms as among those used to allegedly siphon off billions of dollars from 1MDB.
Many of the transactions happened overseas and the police have sought the help of foreign agencies, Noor Rashid added.
Najib has pleaded not guilty to money laundering charges against him this year in connection with a former 1MDB unit.

His lawyer was also charged with money laundering on Thursday.

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine's infrastructure minister, who shepherded the entry of low-cost carrier Ryanair into the country this year, is under investigation by anti-corruption detectives on suspicion of illegal enrichment, national investigators said.
It is the highest-profile case since the national anti-corruption bureau (NABU) was set up after street protests in 2014 brought a pro-Western government to power promising to root out graft and enact reforms. 
In a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Thursday, Infrastructure Minister Volodymyr Omelyan denied any wrongdoing. He suggested the investigation could be a way of discrediting him ahead of elections next year and that he had been targeted by vested interests for pushing economic reforms. 
NABU detectives notified Omelyan of the investigation on Thursday morning, alleging that his assets, which included $90,000 in cash and a BMW car, exceeded what he would have earned as a civil servant since the year 2000. 
They also allege that he did not declare assets worth hundreds of thousands of dollars across 2015 and 2016, including a BMW, the cost of renting the home that he lived in, and the cost of a country residence and land that he also used. 
""The issue of choosing precautionary measures is being considered now,"" NABU, whose investigators were trained by the U.S. FBI, said in a statement.
NABU and prosecutors have called on Omelyan to pay a 5 million hryvnia ($177,872) bond pending the outcome of the case, and a court will decide whether to approve the request. 
Omelyan had told Reuters in an interview in March that he expected legal cases to open against him because he is helping drive reforms, which aim to liberalize the ex-Soviet republic's economy, purge corruption and improve governance.
""But it's normal. It's Ukraine. It's my headache,"" he said at the time. 
Omelyan returned to the theme in his Facebook post, saying criminal proceedings could be opened against people carrying out reforms ""because we live at a time when everything is acquired through struggle.""
""The elections have started,"" he added. Ukraine goes to the polls in presidential and parliamentary elections next year. 
Omelyan helped bring Ryanair to Ukraine in March, something the government hailed as a showcase example of Kiev making life easier for foreign investors despite the country's problems of corruption and the influence of oligarchs over the economy. 
His office declined further comment when contacted by Reuters on Thursday, but he was to hold a press conference at 1430 GMT.

""In recent weeks you have seen nature at its cruellest and on behalf of my family I wanted you to know that our thoughts and prayers are with all those who have been affected,"" William said at the official opening of Japan House London where he was joined by Japan's Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso.
The cultural center, which opened to the public in June, brings together food, art, design and technology, with items such as 100 pound ($135) handcrafted nail clippers, traditional tea cups and Japanese whisky on display.
The center bills itself as a new home for Japanese creativity and business in Britain, where more than 1,000 Japanese companies operate, according to the country's ambassador to Britain Koji Tsuruoka.

Other Japan House centers are in Los Angeles and Sao Paolo, Brazil.

1271,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 13, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>","Ex-New England mob boss, 85 to be sentenced for 1993 murder","BOSTON (Reuters) - An octogenarian former New England mob boss will be sentenced on Thursday for the 1993 murder of a nightclub owner whose remains were discovered buried in Rhode Island two years ago. 
Francis ""Cadillac Frank"" Salemme, 85, and his associate, Paul Weadick, 63, face mandatory life prison terms after a federal jury in Boston convicted them in June of killing club owner Steven DiSarro because they believed he would cooperate with U.S. investigators looking into organized crime. 
The case stemmed from an era when organized crime in Boston was run by Salemme, who headed the New England family of La Cosa Nostra in the 1990s, and James ""Whitey"" Bulger, the gangster serving life in prison. Bulger's criminal career was depicted in the 2015 film ""Black Mass."" 
Salemme's lawyers plan to appeal. They contend the prosecution's star witness lied about witnessing the crime in order to implicate a top organized crime figure and hopefully win a reduction in his own sentence. 
Salemme had a secret interest in a South Boston music venue called The Channel that DiSarro had purchased, prosecutors said. 
Stephen ""The Rifleman"" Flemmi, a longtime partner of Bulger's who had known Salemme since the 1960s, testified during the trial that Salemme had been concerned DiSarro was speaking to authorities and might implicate him in criminal activities. 
Flemmi, the prosecution's star witness who is serving a life sentence for 10 murders, said he witnessed DiSarro's strangling on May 10, 1993, when he went to Salemme's home to talk to the Mafia boss. 
Flemmi said he saw Salemme's now-deceased son, Frank Jr., strangling DiSarro as Weadick held his legs and the elder Salemme watched.
Flemmi, 84, said he quickly left because he was concerned Salemme might be under surveillance. But he said Salemme later told him DiSarro was killed and that his body was buried at a Rhode Island construction site. 
Some of DiSarro's relatives and friends are expected to testify at the sentencing, prosecutors said.

Salemme was only charged in 2016 when authorities discovered DiSarro's remains behind a mill in Providence, Rhode Island.

Suu Kyi, in her first public comment on the case since the two were convicted, referred to the colonial-era law under which they were charged.
""They were not jailed because they were journalists, they were jailed because ... the court has decided that they have broken the Official Secrets Act,"" she said at a conference of the World Economic Forum in Hanoi.
She made her comments in response to a question from a forum moderator who asked whether she felt comfortable about the reporters being jailed.
The journalists, Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, were convicted on official secrets charges on Monday last week in a landmark case that has raised questions about Myanmar's progress toward democracy. 
The two reporters, who had pleaded not guilty, were investigating the killing of 10 villagers from the Muslim Rohingya minority by the Myanmar security forces at the time of their arrest. The military later acknowledged the killings and said it punished several soldiers.
The United Nations, human rights and press freedom groups and various governments criticized the convictions. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence called for their release.
But Suu Kyi questioned whether people were aware of the details of the case.
""I wonder whether very many people have actually read the summary of the judgment which had nothing to do with freedom of expression at all, it had to do with an Official Secrets Act,"" she said.
""If we believe in the rule of law, they have every right to appeal the judgment and to point out why the judgment was wrong.""
Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay was not immediately available to comment on Suu Kyi's remarks. He said last week the court was independent and followed due process.
Reuters, in response to Suu Kyi's comments, said in a statement:
""We continue to believe that Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo did not violate Myanmar’s espionage law, and at no point in time were they engaged in activity to hurt their country.""
PRESSURE
During eight months of hearings, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo testified that two policemen they had not met before handed them papers rolled up in a newspaper during a meeting at a Yangon restaurant on Dec. 12. 
Almost immediately afterwards, they said, they were bundled into a car by plainclothes officers.
On Feb. 1, a police witness said under cross-examination that information in the documents had already been published in newspapers.
In April, a prosecution witness testified that a senior officer had ordered subordinates to plant secret documents on Wa Lone to ""trap"" the reporter.
Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, said Suu Kyi was wrong when she spoke about the verdict.
""She fails to understand that real 'rule of law' means respect for evidence presented in court, actions brought based on clearly defined and proportionate laws, and independence of the judiciary.""
The convictions came amid mounting pressure on Myanmar over a security crackdown sparked by attacks by Rohingya Muslim insurgents on security forces in Rakhine State in west Myanmar in August 2017.
Earlier on Thursday, Suu Kyi said that in hindsight, her government could have handled the Rakhine State situation better.
""There are of course ways in which we, with hindsight, might think that the situation could have been handled better,"" she said. ""But we believe that for the sake of long-term stability and security we have to be fair to all sides ... We cannot choose and pick who should be protected by the rule of law.""
More than 700,000 stateless Rohingya have fled into Bangladesh since then, according to U.N. agencies. Myanmar has denied accusations of atrocities made by refugees, saying it conducted a legitimate counterinsurgency operation against militants.

U.N. investigators last month said Myanmar's military carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Rohingya with ""genocidal intent"", and that the commander-in-chief and five generals should be prosecuted for the gravest crimes under international law.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Two Russians appeared on state television on Thursday, saying they had been wrongly accused by Britain of trying to murder a former Russian spy and his daughter in England and had been visiting Salisbury in March for tourism.
British prosecutors last week identified two Russians they said were operating under aliases - Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - whom they accused of trying to poison Sergei and Yulia Skripal with a military-grade nerve agent in England.
The two men who appeared on Russia's state-funded RT television station had some physical similarities to the men shown in British police images.
""Our friends had been suggesting for a long time that we visit this wonderful town,"" one of the men said of the English town of Salisbury in a short clip of the interview played by RT.
They said they may have approached Sergei Skripal's house by chance but did not know where it was located. They had stayed less than hour in Salisbury, they said, because of bad weather.
Britain has said the two suspects were Russian military intelligence officers almost certainly acting on orders from high up in the Russian state. Russia has repeatedly denied any involvement in the case.
Skripal - a former Russian military intelligence colonel who betrayed dozens of agents to Britain's MI6 foreign intelligence service - and his daughter were found slumped unconscious on a bench in the English city of Salisbury in March. They spent weeks in hospital before being discharged.
The two men said they did not work for GRU, were ordinary businessmen, and the victim of what they called ""a fantastical coincidence."" 
The duo surfaced a day after President Vladimir Putin said Russia had located Petrov and Boshirov, but that there was nothing special or criminal about them. He expressed hope they would come forward and speak publicly.

The affair returned to the headlines in July when a woman near Salisbury, Dawn Sturgess, died and her partner Charlie Rowley fell ill after Rowley found a counterfeit bottle of Nina Ricci perfume containing the Novichok nerve agent and brought it home.

ACCRA (Reuters) - Ghana bid farewell to former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Thursday in a state funeral attended by African leaders and international statesmen who hailed his record as an advocate for humanity and world peace.
Annan, a Ghanaian national and Noble laureate, died in a Swiss hospital last month at the age of 80. His body was flown to Accra on Monday for burial in his homeland, where he is seen as a national hero. 
Around 6,000 mourners packed the auditorium for Thursday's official service - the climax of a multi-day funeral ceremony, which has seen his coffin, draped in the Ghanaian national colors, displayed for public viewing.
Current U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was among the dignitaries in attendance, alongside former Ghanaian presidents, the leaders of Ivory Coast, Liberia, Namibia and Niger, and the Crown Prince of Norway.
In an address, Guterres hailed Annan, who served as the seventh U.N. Secretary-General between 1997 and 2006, as an exceptional global leader with a deep faith in the role of the United Nations as a force for good.
""As we face the headwinds of our troubled and turbulent times, let us always be inspired by the legacy of Kofi Annan,"" Guterres said. 
""Our world needs it now more than ever,"" he said.
The ceremony was projected onto big screens outside the auditorium for the crowds of mourners that could not fit inside the venue. Many commuters in the capital wore black as a sign of respect. 
On Wednesday, Annan's family and Ghanaian dignitaries were among hundreds to file past his casket amid traditional rites by local chiefs and clan leaders.
Annan, a Ghanaian of Ashanti lineage, was granted a royal title by the Ashanti king in 2002. The elders said the rites, including presenting him with clothing and water, were necessary to clear the path for a peaceful ""travel"" for their royal.
Some mourners, like New York-based community mayor Delois Blakely, had flown long distances to pay their respects.
Blakely, who served as an ambassador of goodwill to Africa at the United Nations, told Reuters: ""I had known and worked with Kofi for close to 10 years. He spent his life trying hard to fix our broken society.""

""The decision is that these bombs will be delivered to honor a contract that comes from 2015, and was made by the previous government,"" Borrell told Onda Cero radio.
Human rights groups including Amnesty International have denounced Western arms sales to Saudi Arabia and its allies in a war which the United Nations says has killed more than 10,000 people and left 8.4 million on the brink of famine.
Several government ministries had worked on the issue for a week and the contract was reviewed three times by a commission that authorizes arms sales, Borrell said, adding, ""We found no reason not to carry it out.""
Asked whether Spain had received any guarantees that the weapons would not be used against the civilian population in Yemen, Borrell said the laser-guided bombs hit their targets with ""extraordinary precision"" of within one meter. 
""This kind of weapon does not produce the same sort of bombing as less sophisticated weapons, launched a bit randomly, that create the sort of tragedy that we have all condemned.""
The halting of the deal had created concerns in Spain over the future of a more lucrative contract, signed in July, for state-owned shipbuilder Navantia to supply warships to the Gulf kingdom.

The defense ministry said last month that the current Socialist government, which took power in June, had never sold arms that could be used against a civilian population and would review the criteria used to authorize arms sales.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The leader of India's opposition Congress Party has called for the resignation of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley over what he termed an act of ""collusion"" in the case of Indian tycoon Vijay Mallya - an accusation Jaitley denies.
India wants to extradite the 62-year-old businessman from Britain to face criminal action relating to loans taken out by his defunct  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) Airlines, and Indian authorities want to recover about $1.4 billion they say Kingfisher owes.
Mallya told media outside a London court where his case was being heard on Wednesday that he had met Jaitley to settle matters before he left the country, sparking accusations from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party government was in a position to prevent him leaving the country.
""Vijay Mallya was given a free passage by the finance minister,"" Gandhi told a press conference on Thursday of the perceived missed opportunity.
Jaitley denied any settlement had been reached in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Wednesday, saying he had declined to hold an audience with Mallya by telling him there was ""no point talking to me"". 
""There is no question of my having ever given him an appointment to meet me,"" Jaitley said in the post.
A spokesman for Jaitley declined to comment further on Thursday. 
Dozens of people have fled India in recent years to escape prosecution in an array of cases, many of them loan defaults, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has faced pressure from political opponents to bring them to justice. 
In July, parliament approved a legislation to seize assets of fugitives accused of crimes involving sums over 1 billion rupees ($14 million), as a way to put pressure on them.
Gandhi urged Modi to order an independent probe into Mallya's alleged meeting with Jaitley before he left the country and said until the probe was completed Jaitley must step down.

The court in London said it will give its decision on Dec. 10 on whether Mallya can be sent back to India.

BEIJING (Reuters) - As China's school year kicks off, some longtime Beijing residents are being forced by restrictive residency rules to send their children to distant schools, with some unlucky few packing their bags for places as far south as Shenzhen. 
In the past year, Beijing has evicted a legion of status-less migrant workers and relocated hundreds of factories to cut down on what it calls an ""urban disease"" of over-population. Its number of registered residents saw a rare, albeit small, decline last year to 21.7 million. 
But now, some long-term, tax-paying middle-class families are moving out because new rules have made it difficult for children to get admission in city schools.
A 35-year-old man called He, who did not wish to be further identified, said he had moved out of Beijing to the neighboring district of Hebei after new residency rules barred his six-year-old son from applying for admission to the city's schools. 
He and his son went to Hebei two weeks ago ahead of the start of the school year last week, while his wife had to move in with relatives to be closer to her job in the capital. 
He, who wanted to remain anonymous out of fear his son could lose his place in school, now only sees his wife when she visits them on weekends. He quit his job in Beijing in March. 
""We've taken a big economic hit,"" He said. ""But it's most important that my son has a place to go to school."" 
Among the new rules, a family's registered address must be unchanged for at least one year and match the area where their social benefits are paid. 
Speaking at his nearly-bare two-bedroom apartment in Hebei, He said his family had prepared over a year to ensure they met requirements.
But the local government in the Beijing district of Tongzhou, where he had stayed, published the new rules right before the deadline for school registration for the coming school year, making it impossible for them to qualify.
Hundreds of Tongzhou parents in a similar situation protested for weeks at the Tongzhou education and the Beijing central education bureau offices in May and June. 
One mother, Li, said that of a group of 200 families she knew about that petitioned the authorities, one-third eventually were accepted at Tongzhou schools, one-third chose private schools or moved to different cities, and one-third, like her, were keeping their kids at home for now.
""We paid tuition for a private school, but it was terrible. So we pulled him out,"" said Li, who also did not want her full name published. 
A 10-year resident of Beijing who works in public relations moved his family 2,000 km (1,200 miles) south to Shenzhen after his child was refused admission in a local school. 
""I loved Beijing, but I don't understand what the government is doing. I'm really unhappy with the way they handle things"", said the parent.
UNDER-INVESTMENT
The fight for strained education resources is not limited to the capital. 
In the small city of Leiyang in southern Hunan province, police arrested 46 people in August after 600 people protested over difficulties enrolling their children in school.
The problems arose after the local government said some students would be diverted from over-burdened schools to other schools, according to local media. 
While China has significantly increased its investment in education in recent decades, it still lags global average spending levels. 
An International Monetary Fund report in July said China still underspends other emerging markets on education as a percentage of gross domestic product.
The issue is also in focus as some Chinese regional governments have been under pressure from deteriorating finances and heavy debt burdens. 
Meanwhile, even those who meet residency requirements in Beijing deal with school headaches. 
Fang, an IT manager at a central state-owned insurance company, said he had to move to a smaller apartment in a new district in Beijing for his son to qualify for Beijing school enrolment. 
Fang said he also had to pay the landlord an additional 40,000 yuan (nearly $6,000) just for the landlord to sign-off on Fang's son using the apartment's allotted spot in a school. 
Other parents, including He and Li, said some landlords were charging 100,000 yuan for a spot. 
With such an opaque system, there is ample room for corruption and loopholes, parents say, as those with the right relationships or with money for bribes are able to get their kids in school. 
He said he had to take the Hebei school principal out for dinner several times before he would agree to accept his son. 

""Even though the school is pretty lousy, at least he's in school.""

On Monday, the governor of the north Aegean region said the Moria camp on the island of Lesbos, Greece's biggest, faced closure next month unless authorities cleaned up uncontrollable amounts of waste.
More than 8,300 refugees and migrants are in the former military camp, housed in shipping containers and flimsy tents in conditions widely criticized as falling short of basic standards. 
The NGOs, which included Oxfam and Action Aid, called conditions at Moria ""shameful"", but said the same applied to other island camps.
""There is no excuse for the ... conditions in which thousands of people remain trapped in limbo while they wait out their asylum claims,"" the NGOs said.
""Moria ... is currently housing almost three times its capacity. The sewage system does not work and filthy toilet water reaches the tents and mattresses where children sleep.""
Last month the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR urged Greece to speed up transfers of eligible asylum-seekers from Aegean islands to the mainland, noting that conditions at Moria were ""reaching boiling point"".
Greece has moved asylum seekers to the mainland in recent months and is looking to speed up efforts to reduce numbers at the camps.

Lesbos, not far from Turkey, was the preferred entry point into the European Union in 2015 for nearly a million Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis. Small numbers of boats continue to arrive there.

PYONGYANG (Reuters) - Packed into Pyongyang's giant stadium this week with thousands of other tourists, Australian Mitchell Hamilton marvelled at the return of North Korea's “Mass Games,” a huge pageant that has produced some of the most iconic images of the isolated country.
“My thought sitting there was that it was a show fit for a god,” Hamilton told Reuters on Tuesday atop the Juche Tower, a 560-foot (170-metre) obelisk in downtown Pyongyang. “You can’t help but get swept up in the spectacle.”
A sobering reminder of the power of the state in North Korea, however, was the realisation that many of the thousands of performers on the field were young children.
“What brought me back down to earth was when the kids ran out,” Hamilton said, leaning in to speak out of ear shot of the North Korean guides and minders who were accompanying both tourists and media. ""It reminded me where I am.""
North Korea's first Mass Games in five years has provided a chance for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to raise foreign currency, at a time when tourism remains one of the few remaining reliable sources of income amid tough U.N. sanctions.
Since a reduction in tensions over North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme this year, tour operators say tourism has increased. 
Exact numbers are not available, but tour operators say flights and accommodation in Pyongyang booked up so fast after the Mass Games were announced that North Korean authorities put holds on some tour groups from China.
Thousands of children participate in the performances, either as dancers or as one of the “human pixels” who use colored flipbooks to form an ever-changing backdrop of images and slogans.
That practice has been criticized by rights groups as tantamount to forced child labor, and testimonies collected by defector groups describe harsh training regimes.
For this month's Mass Games, elementary, middle and high school practiced from early morning until late at night, the defector-run website Daily NK said citing an unnamed source. 
Past reports from Daily NK describe students taking bladder infection medicine due to the long hours of sitting required, while training in all weather for months.
Beyond the sanctions over its nuclear weapons program, North Korea is an impoverished state, where some 40 percent of the population, or more than 10 million people, need humanitarian assistance and about 20 percent of children suffer from malnutrition, according to U.N. estimates.
Under Kim’s one-man rule, the country has also been accused of widespread human rights abuses, with a U.N. report last year estimating between 80,000 and 120,000 people are held in prison camps.
LONG WAIT
Still, the Mass Games performances, expected to run into early October, are a major drawcard for tourists, most of whom come from China. 
“I think I’ve wanted it for like five years, or even more,” Tia Nousiainen from Finland told Reuters as she visited tourist sites in Pyongyang.
“Since I saw the first mass games on the TV or the internet, I wanted to see them by myself. And every year, I’ve been asking the travel agency if they are arranging them, and this year, I got the answer that ‘yes,’ they are arranging it.”
Personally attended by Kim, Sunday’s premiere at the stadium North Korea says can hold 150,000 featured new high-tech displays by glowing drone formations, lasers, and light projections.
Thousands of dancers, gymnasts, martial artists and singers acted out scenes addressing familiar themes from North Korean propaganda. 
The show, however, dropped most of the typical anti-American themes, instead focusing on Kim Jong Un’s diplomatic engagement with international leaders.
Joel Goh, a visitor from Singapore, said the Mass Games made him want to see for himself the country behind so many of the headlines.
“It was a very special experience… I thought it was as good as any other show I’ve seen,” he said, adding that the scenes of Kim embracing South Korean President Moon Jae-in at their first summit in April were “quite moving.”

“We’ve come to realize it’s a bit different from what we hear outside,” Goh said of North Korea. “It’s an amazing place. I’m not regretting my trip at all.”

""Every country has its sovereign right to make internal reforms it deems appropriate,"" Poland's foreign ministry said in a statement late on Wednesday.
""Actions aimed against member states serve only deepening divides in the EU, increasing citizens' current lack of confidence to European institutions.""
The European Parliament voted on Wednesday to sanction Hungary for neglecting norms on democracy, civil rights and corruption in a first bid to launch the punitive process of the EU treaty's Article 7.
Since sweeping to power in 2010, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, once a campaigner against Hungary's Soviet Communist overlords, has used his parliamentary majority to pressure courts, media and non-government groups.

He has also led opposition to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and others who want Europe to take in more Muslim refugees.

The man went with his wife to a trucking company in Bakersfield, California, where he shot and killed a man and then turned his gun on his spouse, killing her, Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood told a news conference. 
He then chased another man from the trucking company before he shot and killed him in front of a nearby sports store.
The gunman later killed two men at a residence. He then commandeered a vehicle from a woman and her child before he killed himself when he was confronted by a sheriff's deputy, Youngblood said.

Reuters witnesses said Israeli forces arrived at the village before sunrise on Thursday and began taking down the newly built protest huts, without touching the Bedouin encampment, the fate of which has become a focus of Palestinian protests and international concern.
Israel’s military liaison agency with the Palestinians, COGAT, said on Twitter that five ""movable structures that were illegally transported & installed"" in the area had been taken down.
The five new huts had been assembled this week by activists from several rights groups and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in support of the Bedouin community.
Khan al-Ahmar is beside an Israeli highway that runs through the West Bank from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea.
Israel’s plan to demolish the village and relocate its 180 residents - Bedouins who scrape a living by raising sheep and goats - to a site 12 km (7 miles) away, has drawn criticism from Palestinians and some European states, who cite the impact on the community and prospects for peace.
Palestinians say the demolition is part of an Israeli push to create an arc of settlements that would effectively cut off East Jerusalem from the West Bank, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and which the Palestinians seek for an independent state.

Last week, Israel’s Supreme Court rejected petitions to prevent the move, siding with the authorities who say the village was built without required permits. Palestinians say such documents are impossible to obtain.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan's Charlie Chaplin says he has witnessed suicide attacks, explosions and threats from hardline Islamic militant groups, but is determined to waddle and bumble to fulfill the primary goal of his life. 
""It is very simple, I want to give Afghans a reason to smile,"" said Karim Asir, a stand-up comedian who performs across the capital Kabul in Chaplin's trademark oversized shoes, baggy pants, cane and black bowler hat.
Asir, 25, said Chaplin impersonators are found all over the world helping people ignore grief and making them laugh, and he does the same.
Asir's early years were in Iran, where his family fled after the hardline Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 1996. There he saw performances of Chaplin on Iranian TV.
After the family returned home, Asir started wearing make-up and recreating Chaplin's characters in his performances, despite his parent's apprehensions.
His live performances provide respite in a city that routinely gets attacked by Taliban insurgents and suicide bombers, mainly claiming allegiance to Islamic State.
Asir says he has been threatened by militants who say his performances are un-Islamic. But despite the threats, he performs in public parks, orphanages, private parties and at charity events organized by international aid agencies.
""I want to give my people a chance to forget their problems such as war, conflicts and insecurity in Afghanistan,"" he said.
Afghanistan's traditional culture includes music and performance arts. However, under the Taliban's rule from 1996 to 2001, most cultural activities were banned because they were seen as anti-Islamic. 
In Kabul, when Asir's fans surround him to take selfies, he smiles but is constantly worried about attacks.

""I am afraid of getting attacked by a suicide bomber or an explosion but these issues cannot stop me from being Charlie Chaplin,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Rhode Island Democratic Governor Gina Raimondo turned back a challenge from her party's left-wing flank in the state's nominating contests on Wednesday, advancing her bid to win a second term in office in November's general election.
Raimondo, 47, a former venture capitalist, had about 56 percent of the vote with most precincts counted in the heavily Democratic state. Her main opponent, Matt Brown, an anti-nuclear activist and former state secretary of state, polled about 34 percent. 
Rhode Island tends to favor Democrats at the state and federal levels, but Raimondo's approval levels are below 50 percent, according to public polling.
Raimondo, the first woman to serve as Rhode Island governor, will face Republican nominee Allan Fung, the mayor of Cranston, Rhode Island, whom she defeated in a three-way race in 2014, and Joseph Trillo, a former Republican state legislator running as an independent.
Polling suggests the general election could be close. Election prediction firms rate it as either ""likely"" or ""leans"" Democratic. 
Leftist Democrats have been gaining momentum in nominating contests for the Nov. 6 elections in which the party is seeking to regain control of the U.S. Congress and bolster its representation in state governments across the country, where Republicans control a majority of governorships and legislatures. 
Several challenges to centrist Democratic governors have fallen short, but voters have chosen candidates who ran from the left in Democratic gubernatorial nominating contests in Georgia and Florida. 
Among Democratic congressional candidates who have pulled off upsets are Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, who both defeated longtime incumbents in primaries in New York and Massachusetts and have promised to target Republican President Donald Trump's policies.
Raimondo campaigned on her fiscal management efforts as state treasurer to win the governorship in 2014, but some of the measures have since stirred a backlash.
Brown criticized Raimondo's decision to overhaul the state's underfunded pension plans when she was treasurer in 2011, cutting pension payments to save billions, which angered some retirees. 
Rhode Island's contests on Wednesday were the second-to-last before November, with New York remaining on Thursday. In New York's Democratic state primary on Thursday, activist and former ""Sex and the City"" co-star Cynthia Nixon is challenging Governor Andrew Cuomo.

SULAIMANIYA/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Violent protests in the Iraqi city of Basra have all but ended U.S.-backed Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's chances of winning a second term and shattered Washington's hopes of shaping the next government.
Fifteen people have been killed protesting against power cuts, polluted water, poor services and perceived corruption in Iraq's second city, many of them in clashes with security forces.
Political allies and leaders of the religious establishment blame Abadi for the turmoil, putting an alliance he has formed with populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr under threat. 
The alliance with Sadr, whose Saeroon bloc finished first in an election in May but has been unable to form a government, offered Abadi his best chance of remaining prime minister.
But Sadr has condemned Abadi's management of the Basra crisis and is in advanced talks with the Fatih coalition, led by popular Iranian-backed Shi'ite militia commander Hadi al-Amiri, to form a new alliance, sources close to the talks told Reuters.
A deal between Fatih and Saeroon could give Iran, a U.S. enemy, a chance of gaining more leverage in Iraq, its most important Arab neighbor. 
""Talks between Fatih and Saeroon are serious and could lead to a breakthrough in the political crisis soon,"" said lawmaker Razzaq al-Haidari, a member of Amiri’s Badr Organisation.
The two sides are still negotiating details, the sources said. But one senior source in Fatih said a compromise had been agreed under which both would withdraw their leading candidates for the premiership. 
""That's what we (Saeroun and Fatih) agreed on, so Amiri has withdrawn his candidacy. And we agreed that Abadi isn't eligible for a second term,"" the source said.
Sadr and Amiri agreed on Wednesday to accelerate the formation of a government. Full details of their talks were not available but a coalition looks imminent.
""Abadi's failure in managing the Basra crisis totally convinced Sadr that supporting Abadi will put his status and popularity among millions of followers on the line,"" said Baghdad-based analyst Ahmed Younis.
The United States backed Abadi because it saw him as a moderate who could stabilize a country beset by sectarian, turbulent politics. But Washington may have miscalculated, cultivating no alternatives.
The collapse of Abadi's candidacy would reduce the U.S. sway over politics in Iraq, where it competes with Iran. Tehran has steadily increased its influence in the country since a U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.
ABADI TOLD TO LEAVE BASRA
The protests in Iraq's south, the country's main oil hub, mark a rejection of the political establishment that has held on to power with the support of the United States and Iran despite failing to improve people's lives.
During a visit on Monday to Basra, which is in the heartland of Iraq's Shi'ite Muslim majority, Abadi was met by protesters who demanded he leave the city. Abadi's office was not available for comment.
Political gains from Abadi's victory over the militant Islamic State group in Iraq last year, with U.S. support, proved short-lived and the problems in Basra have put years of government failures in sharp focus. 
""The message from Basra is loud and clear for all political elites,"" said Ali al-Mawlawi, the head of Research at Baghdad-based Al Bayan Center. ""They’ve realized, if you like, that there's a ticking time bomb.""
Sadr portrays himself as a fierce nationalist opposed to both U.S. and Iranian interference in Iraq, but would have to give regional power Iran some room for maneuver in any partnership with Amiri’s bloc. 
Iran is trying to preserve its interests in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East after President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Tehran and decided to re-impose stringent sanctions on its foe.
There are no guarantees that Tehran can mould Iraq's the political landscape without a struggle. Many voters who supported Sadr in the election are disillusioned with the Iranian-backed political elite they accuse of corruption.
Sadr and Abadi's union was fragile from the start and had already been showing signs of strain before Saeroon's leadership, and then Fatih's, called on Saturday for Abadi to resign after an emergency parliamentary session on Basra.
""That was our declaration that this was the end for Abadi and his second term,"" said the senior source in Fatih.
OLD GUARD UNDER FIRE
In a clear reference to Abadi and others, Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, whose interventions can bring down politicians, condemned the neglect of Basra and called for an end to the old guard. 
Brett McGurk, a senior U.S. envoy, was in Iraq last week trying to rally support for Abadi among various factions.
But Iran has also been trying to shape the next government in Iraq. Senior Iranian delegations have been in the capital Baghdad for several months, trying to convince divided Shi'ite factions to unite behind one candidate for prime minister. 
Mojtaba Khamenei, the son of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has also visited Baghdad for talks with Amiri and Maliki, three political sources said. 
Success is not certain for Iran. Protesters in Basra set fire to the Iranian consulate and chanted ""Iran out, out"", a warning of the risks of being too close to outside influences. 
Iran and the United States will also both face the delicate task of trying to promote a candidate for prime minister who does not look dependent on them and is outside the political establishment which many Iraqis blame for the problems in Basra. 
""The way the Americans and the Iranians have viewed Iraq until now is if they back their horse, they can control the country,"" said Renad Mansour, an Iraq expert at the Chatham House think-tank in London.

""What this new potential coalition is saying – or at least what the Sadrists are saying – is we don't have a problem with international affairs. But you can no longer treat us as your proxies. We're not your proxies, we're your allies.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. diplomat for Africa welcomed a rapprochement between Ethiopia and Eritrea ending two decades of hostility but said concerns over Eritrea's human rights record hindered cooperation with Washington.
The leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea re-opened crossing points on their shared border for the first time in 20 years on Tuesday, raising hopes of reduced tensions in the region.
Tibor Nagy, the U.S. State Department's assistant secretary for Africa, told a congressional hearing on Wednesday that the United States had ""deliberately engaged"" with Eritrea in recent months but it was too soon to talk about lifting United Nations sanctions imposed in 2009, which accused it of supporting Islamist militants in Somalia. Eritrea denied the charge.
Among concerns that the United States had raised with Eritrea was the detention of U.S. embassy local staff and several Americans for what Nagy called politically-motivated reasons. 
The United States also wanted a full explanation from Eritrea over past weapons purchases from North Korea highlighted in a U.N. report, said Nagy, without elaborating.
He said the jailing of religious and political prisoners and indefinite, obligatory national service, as well as a tightly-controlled system of government were also a worry.
""Eritrea cannot assume that by saying wonderful things and opening good relations with the neighbors that will automatically lead to sanctions relief,"" said Nagy, a former U.S. ambassador to Ethiopia.
""There have to be concrete actions taken and we will remain very engaged and say things that may not always be popular but have to be said,"" he added.
Eritrea has long dismissed accusations of human rights abuses by the U.N., including alleged extrajudicial killings and torture, as ""totally unfounded and without merit.""
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Eritrea in 2009, backed by 13 of the 15 members of the U.N. Security Council. The sanctions included an arms embargo, travel restrictions and asset freezes for some of the country's top officials.
But warming ties between Eritrea and Ethiopia this year and sweeping reforms by Ethiopia's new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed have reshaped the political landscape in the Horn of Africa.
Abiy's ruling coalition has ended a state of emergency and released political prisoners, while also announcing plans to partially open up the economy to foreign investors.
In his boldest move, Abiy offered last month to make peace with Eritrea, 20 years after the neighbors started a border war that killed an estimated 80,000 people. Full-blown fighting ended by 2000, but their troops have faced off across their disputed frontier ever since.

""Up to now for the last 20-plus years Eritrea has used Ethiopia as an excuse to maintain what I would almost call a 'fortress state',"" Nagy said. ""With the opening of peace they really will no longer have a reason to do that.""

Saca, 53, pleaded guilty to the charges last month. His lawyer said at the time that he had pleaded guilty in exchange for a reduction in his prison sentence.
During the trial, prosecutors said Saca had appropriated public funds for himself and others, including taking more than $7 million for his former party, the right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA).
Five years of the sentence were for money laundering, and five for embezzlement. He also has to give back $260 million to the state.
The court also sentenced six other former officials from Saca's government to between three and 16 years for participating in a network of corruption.
Saca, who governed El Salvador between 2004 and 2009, was detained in October 2016 during his son's wedding.
Saca's successor as president, Mauricio Funes, has been in exile in Nicaragua since September 2016, also accused of corruption. He has been accused of using public funds to pay for trips, home remodeling and hospital bills, among other expenses.

Leftist Funes, who governed El Salvador between 2009 and 2014, has said he is a victim of political attacks orchestrated by businessmen and conservatives.

Duque, who took office on Aug. 7, has said the Marxist rebels need to free a total of 19 hostages they have been holding and halt criminal activity like drug trafficking before he will restart the negotiations, which began with the previous government 18 months ago. 
Earlier this month, the ELN freed three hostages. The government has said the group holds 10 other civilians. Those released on Wednesday were three police officers, a soldier and two civilians contracted by the armed forces.
The last round of the negotiations, which are being held in Cuba, ended on Aug. 1, before former President Juan Manuel Santos left office.
""We accompanied the humanitarian commission that facilitated the release of six people who were being held by the ELN since August. We're happy that you will soon be able to reunite with your families,"" the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a tweet.
The government human rights ombudsman also confirmed the release, which took place in the Pacific province of Choco.
In a video message, an ELN commander known only by his nom de guerre, Uriel, said: ""The ELN keeps its word.""
The government and the ELN failed to reach a ceasefire agreement at the end of the most recent round of talks. The guerrillas renewed bomb attacks and kidnappings after a bilateral ceasefire, the first-ever between the two sides, expired in January. 
Colombia has been at war with the 1,500-member ELN, which was founded by radical Catholic priests, since 1964.
Duque has expressed anger at a 2016 agreement reached with the larger Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel group, which he has said is too lenient toward the former guerrillas.
He said he did not want a similar deal with the ELN.
Colombia's conflict between the government, rebel groups, paramilitaries and crime gangs has lasted more than 50 years, killing at least 260,000 people and displacing millions.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's congress on Wednesday approved a bill allowing people over the age of 14 to change their name and gender in official records, despite intense lobbying by the Church and conservative political parties in the traditionally conservative, predominantly Catholic country.
The law, introduced in 2013, was fiercely contested by conservative parties until an article relating to children under the age of 14 was dropped. Children aged 14 to 18 must first obtain the consent of their parents or legal guardians.
The gender identity law must be either rejected or entered onto the statute books by center-right President Sebastian Pinera within 30 days.
Ivan Moreira, a senator from Chile's conservative UDI party, described the law as an ""aberration"" that would divide families.
But the Foundation for Equal Rights said the law would help make the country more inclusive. 
""This is a milestone in the recognition of the right to gender identity of trans people and a tremendous triumph for adolescents between 14 and 18 years old, who will be able to benefit from this initiative,"" said Jimena Lizama, legal director for the foundation.
The new law defines gender identity as a personal conviction of whether a person sees himself or herself as male or female, irrespective of their physical state or the gender or name assigned to them in the country's civic register. 
There are no official statistics for the number of trans people in Chile.
The law is one of a number of progressive laws recently passed in Chile. In August last year, the Constitutional Court partially lifted a ban on abortion if a woman's life was in danger, if she was carrying an unviable fetus or if she became pregnant as a result of rape.

Yameen is seeking a second five-year term in the Indian Ocean archipelago popular with tourists. But his main rivals have been jailed for charges ranging from terrorism to attempting to topple the government, leading to doubts abroad over the legitimacy of the vote.
The Maldives has been beset by political instability since a police mutiny forced its first democratically elected leader, Mohamed Nasheed, out of office in 2012.
The main opposition Maldivian Democratic Party said in a statement that measures aimed at keeping foreign journalists out of the Maldives ""in order to reduce scrutiny of (Yameen's) unlawful and unconstitutional behavior"" must be eased.
""The measures should be viewed as a pre-emptive cover-up of planned electoral fraud,"" it said.
The opposition presidential candidate Ibrahim Mohamed Solih on Twitter called on the authorities to ""reverse restrictive measures against international journalists"".
Government officials declined to comment.
The government has said that journalists who try to cover the election on a tourist visa will face punitive measures. In February, it deported two AFP journalists working while on tourist visas.
According to the new measures, journalists must apply for business visas, for which they need a Maldivian sponsor, and submit forms giving details of previous employment, travel history, qualifications, bank account details and a police clearance certificate, the MDP said.
Previously, the Maldives gave journalists visas on arrival.
The opposition statement came two days after police said they had received information of an ""organized conspiracy"" to commit serious offences aimed at convincing foreign stakeholders that the upcoming election ""is not independent and fair"".
On Friday, president Yameen's administration accused the United States of intimidation, after Washington called for the release of ""falsely accused"" political prisoners and threatened action if the island's election is not held freely and fairly.
Former leader Nasheed, fearing possible poll rigging, has urged the international community to examine the results of the election in consultation with all political parties prior to accepting the victory of any candidate.

President Yameen's government has rejected repeated requests by the United Nations, rights groups and the West to release the president's rivals.

Launching a new ""Global Extremism Monitor"" by his Institute for Global Change that tracks incidents of Islamist extremism, Blair will say that ""security alone will never be enough"" and governments need to focus more on prevention.
In a report, his institute found there are 121 violent Islamist groups operating globally and they were responsible for more than 84,000 deaths in 2017, mainly in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia and Nigeria.
Blair, Labour prime minister from 1997 to 2007, said the world spends hundreds of billions of dollars each year on new security at airports and counter-terrorism, but only a fraction of that amount on measures to tackle the underlying ideology. 
He instead calls for higher spending on education and development, investing in war-torn states and supporting Muslim leaders working to counter extremism.
""Security measures will be vital. But security alone will never be enough. It will only slow the violence,"" Blair said. ""Unless there is a global will to meet the depth of the challenges, the ideology of Islamism will grow—and with it, the violence. It is time to act.""
The former prime minister, who led Britain into the Iraq conflict in 2003, has admitted in the past that the invasion was partly responsible for the rise of Islamic State, which until last year controlled large areas in Syria and Iraq.

Blair said Muslims were the main victims of Islamist extremism with two-thirds of all attacks aimed at civilians taking place in Muslim-majority countries.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Labor unions and social groups blocked streets in downtown Buenos Aires on Wednesday to protest austerity measures proposed by the government and backed by the International Monetary Fund to reduce Argentina's debt. 
Protesters are angry about the belt-tightening policies, which are cutting services to low-income Argentines already walloped by inflation of 31 percent and climbing.
But Argentine leader Mauricio Macri said he needs to carry out such measures to regain investors' confidence by reducing the country's spending. 
The outlook for Latin America's third-biggest economy is grim, according to orthodox and left-leaning economists alike. Planned cuts to public utility subsidies, forcing Argentines to pay more for transportation and electricity, are expected to keep upward pressure on consumer prices for the rest of 2018.
""The day-to-day uncertainty is getting worse,"" said protester Gabriela Gil, a 49-year-old mother of five. 
The year will close with inflation at more than 40 percent, according to economists' forecasts. Hardest hit are low-income families that spend a high proportion of their income on food.
""The poorest people in the country are on the verge of hunger,"" said Daniel Menendez, a spokesman for Barrios de Pie, one of the groups that helped organized the march. 
FISCAL MEDICINE
Measures aimed at taming inflation, like the central bank's 60 percent monetary policy rate, have helped push the economy into recession by choking off credit. Stimulus spending that might pep up the economy would dash Macri's promise of bringing the primary fiscal deficit to zero next year. The previous 2019 deficit target was 1.3 percent of gross domestic product.
Economy Minister Nicolas Dujovne said earlier this month that it was weakness on the country's ""fiscal flank"" that prompted a run on the peso in August. The currency fell 26 percent last month and has lost more than half its value so far in 2018. 
On Tuesday, the peso fell 1.4 percent to close at 38.5 per dollar. 
Having signed a $50 billion standby financing deal with the IMF in June, the slide in the peso prompted Macri's administration to pledge deeper spending cuts to secure an early release of funds.
The revamped fiscal targets were being hammered out by government authorities and IMF staff in Buenos Aires, the Fund said in a statement on Wednesday. ""Our common objective is to reach a rapid conclusion to these discussions so as to present a proposal to the IMF executive board,"" the statement said.
The targets will be incorporated into the 2019 budget bill that Macri is expected to send to Congress over the days ahead. 
""What we are seeing in asset prices in Argentina is that people are not giving them the benefit of the doubt,"" Daniel Osorio, president of New York-based consultancy Andean Capital Advisors, said in a telephone interview.
With investors demanding that the government stand by its budget-cutting program, some economists say the bitter fiscal medicine called for by the IMF might prove worse than the recession and high inflation that are already ailing Argentina.
""The financial markets have closed for the country. Argentina's government is responding by attempting a much more drastic fiscal adjustment,"" said Martin Guzman, an economist at Columbia University Business School.
""My view is that such a measure will lead to another recession in 2019.""

Macron, who has come under fire as a president of the rich after implementing tax cuts for the wealthy and for companies, is set to outline his anti-poverty strategy on Thursday.
""Our poverty plan is worth 8 billion euros, spread over four years,"" government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told the free newspaper 20 Minutes.
""It's a very strong political choice at a time when we are paying very close attention to public spending.""
The INSEE statistics agency estimates that in 2016 some 8.8 million people in France were living in poverty, defined as 60 percent of the median income. That was equivalent to 14 percent of the population.
Griveaux did not say whether the money would come from fresh funds or existing cash reallocated from other budgets.
Macron's poverty plan, which has already been delayed once, has been much anticipated as he seeks to convince voters that his reform agenda does not benefit only the wealthy and businesses.
Griveaux did not specify how the money would be spent but said the government planned several measures to get people either back to work or into better jobs. While various welfare programs have been expanded over the last two decades, Griveaux said they had failed to root out the causes of poverty.

1311,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 03:57PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Brazil prosecutors seek leniency talks with BRF in food fraud probe,"By Ana Mano
PONTA GROSSA, Brazil (Reuters) - Brazilian federal prosecutors probing whether chicken processor BRF SA and certain laboratories colluded to cheat on food safety tests are seeking cooperation from the firms in return for more lenient penalties, a federal prosecutor told Reuters in an interview.
Prosecutors had found ""grave irregularities"" and would demand that the companies carry out a root-and-branch restructure as part of any leniency deal, federal prosecutor Lyana Helena Joppert Kalluf said last week. 
Police raids of three testing laboratories owned by Mérieux NutriSciences Brasil and used by BRF had turned up data showing a ""systematically"" high number of false positives for the salmonella pathogen, according to court documents seen by Reuters that were previously sealed.
That raises questions over the methodology used by the labs, with the level of false positives deemed ""unacceptable"" by Ministry of Agriculture experts, the documents showed.
The ministry declined to comment. BRF pointed to a previous statement, in which it said that it was cooperating with the police and was fully compliant with Brazilian and international norms.
Mérieux, controlled by France's Institut Mérieux, a holding company which also owns diagnostics firm Biomérieux, said in an email it had not had access to the ministry's opinion as expressed in the court filing.
""Based on our internal tracking systems that compile test data going back years, there is no evidence to support claims of a high rate of false positives in salmonella tests"" carried out in its Brazilian food labs, it said.
Mérieux has previously said that there was no evidence of wrongdoing by its laboratories.
BRF shares added to earlier losses after the Reuters report and were down 3.3 percent at 20.91 reais in late afternoon trading.
BRF, the world's biggest chicken exporter, and five Mérieux laboratories in Brazil accredited by the ministry are being investigated by police over accusations that they falsified test results.
The probe stemmed from another in which BRF and other meatpackers were accused of bribing government health inspectors to evade food quality and safety checks.
The scandals sent BRF's shares plunging and prompted several export markets to temporarily close their doors to Brazil.
Repairing BRF's reputation is the number-one challenge ahead for the company's recently named chief executive, Pedro Parente.
Kalluf said she and her colleagues were seeking leniency talks with BRF and Mérieux, an instrument widely used during Brazil's so-called Car Wash corruption probes with which authorities can advance and conceivably widen an investigation through cooperation.
Speaking in her office in Ponta Grossa, Parana state, Kalluf said that leniency talks tend to be complex and demand collaborative testimony from the parties involved - which she said had yet to be forthcoming in this case.
""We've identified grave irregularities in terms of public health,"" she said. ""What we want first and foremost is that this is the object of a corporate restructuring.""
Kalluf said nobody had yet been charged in connection with the probe.
In securities filings, BRF has said the investigations ""may result in penalties, fines and sanctions from governmental authorities or other forms of liability.""
A successful leniency negotiation requires a commitment from the signing companies to tackle the root of the misconduct. They also normally entail financial compensation for damages, Kalluf said.
The next milestone in the case will be the release in late September of a full report detailing the key findings of the probe after the March police raids, she said.
The companies may become keener on entering leniency talks once that report is released, Kalluf said, adding that the criminal investigation will continue regardless of whether they do engage in talks.

""We will not stop the criminal probe to discuss leniencies. If a company engages in leniency discussions, this will be evaluated separately.""

ON BOARD A BELGIAN AIR FORCE PLANE (Reuters) - British, French and German fighter jets simulated flight interceptions over Western Europe on Wednesday as part of NATO drills to deter Russian planes from entering allied airspace and to showcase European efforts to integrate their air defenses.
Fighter pilots carrying air-to-air missiles from 10 NATO nations took turns to simulate the interception of a Belgian air force transport plane en route to Spain, performing visual inspections of the aircraft's status by hovering off the wings at speeds of 900 km/hour (560 mph).
Some 60 NATO jets, mainly from European allies, are on alert to defend alliance airspace, as NATO deals with a dramatic increase in Russian air activity on its borders since Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014, with a record 870 interceptions in the Baltics alone in 2016.
This month, Moscow is holding its largest war games since the fall of the Soviet Union, with some 1,000 aircraft.
""NATO is relevant. This is not theoretical,"" said Spanish Air Force Lieutenant General Ruben Garcia Servert on board the Belgian military transport plane, as Italian Eurofighters flew close to the cockpit to simulate interceptions. They later included British Typhoons and French Mirages.
""We have not always been successful in showing the taxpayer that we have the means and the capabilities to protect the population,"" he told Reuters during a rare mid-air public display of flight interceptions.
European allies hope such displays highlight how their air forces are defending Europe in the face of sharp criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump, who at a summit in July railed against Europeans for not spending enough on defense and ports.
Able to divert, force to land or potentially even shoot down combat aircraft, NATO says its so-called air policing is not directed at Russia. But showdowns between rival warplanes in the Baltic and Black Sea are intensifying.
Two U.S. jets escorted two Russian bombers over the Arctic Ocean on Sept. 7 in the latest incident, while Russia has scrambled fighter jets to intercept nuclear-capable U.S. bombers in interceptions that have echoes of the Cold War.
Analysts warn that any collisions in the air over the Mediterranean, Baltic or Black Sea could risk the start of a wider conflict with Russia. 
""SINGLE SKY"" DEFENSES
Both sides accuse the other of dangerous pilot behavior, but NATO says Russian warplanes regularly fly without respecting international safety norms, such as responding to air traffic control and requests to identify themselves. Russia says all its flights are conducted in accordance with international law.
""We have seen aircraft coming to our borders without flight plans, without any kind of controls ... safety regulations, entering into our area,"" Garcia Severt said. 
""We have seen frequent activities in the Black Sea, but not only, sometimes we have seen aircraft flying around Europe,"" he said, referring to Russian bombers off Portugal's coast.
NATO will hold its biggest exercise since 2002 in October and November in Norway, called Trident Juncture, and involving non-NATO Finland and Sweden, with more than 40,000 troops. 
While tensions with Russia have already prompted NATO to deploy multinational land battalions in Poland and the Baltics, NATO is also pushing to integrate its air forces, despite political resistance over issues of sovereignty.
Under an agreement being negotiated, individual NATO countries' air forces would defend each other's airspaces, regardless of the country they are in, under a ""single sky"" concept that could see Portuguese planes defending Spanish airspace, for example. 

Today, each nation defends its own airspace, unless, as in the case of the Baltics, it does not have fighter planes.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is traveling to China to discuss economic agreements, as the crisis-struck OPEC nation seeks to convince its key Asian financier to disburse fresh loans. 
""I am going with great expectations and we will see each other again in a few days with big achievements,"" the leftist leader said on Wednesday in a state broadcast from the airport, without providing details. 
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment and it was not immediately possible to obtain a comment from the Chinese government. 
Over a decade, China plowed more than $50 billion into Venezuela through oil-for-loan agreements that helped Beijing secure energy supplies for its fast-growing economy while bolstering an anti-Washington ally in Latin America.
The flow of cash halted nearly three years ago, however, when Venezuela asked for a change of payment terms amid falling oil prices and declining crude output that pushed its state-led economy into a hyperinflationary collapse.
Venezuela's Finance Ministry in July said it would receive $250 million from the China Development Bank to boost oil production but offered no details. Venezuela previously accepted a $5 billion loan from China for its oil sector but has yet to receive the entire amount.

Local consultant Asdrubal Oliveros, who tracks Chinese loans closely, said on Wednesday Venezuela was close to clinching a fresh loan of $5 billion to finance oil projects. Beijing was waiting for Maduro to announce a series of economic measures, including a steep devaluation and more flexible currency controls, before extending fresh funds, Oliveros said.

The attack on Monday, claimed by Islamic State militants, killed two people and wounded 25. 
NOC provides the vast bulk of the Libyan state's income and, along with the Tripoli-based central bank, is one of the only state enterprises still functioning well after years of armed factional conflict. 
""The National Oil Corporation has assured all citizens that it has implemented contingency plans to deal with the crisis to ensure that (its) production and daily operations continue on a regular basis,"" NOC said in a statement. 
""This attack did not cause a loss of production,"" NOC chairman Mustafa Sonallah said in the statement, which did not reveal NOC's current production level.
""However, it led to the shedding of Libyan blood,"" Sonallah said, adding that the attack ""is indicative of the weakness and fragility of the security arrangements in the country”. 
He also said the current security vacuum ""allows terrorist organisations to be present inside the country"".
Libya has been divided between rival governments and military factions based in the east and west of the country since 2014, causing political deadlock and an economic crisis.
However, the NOC has continued to function relatively normally across Libya, which relies on oil exports for most of its income. Oil output has been hit by attacks on oil facilities and blockades, though last year it partially recovered to around one million barrels per day. 

Islamist militants have sleeper cells in northern cities as well as mobile units in Libya's southern desert, according to Libyan and Western officials.

Officials and diplomats close to the negotiations told Reuters previously this month that work was under way to find wording that could ease British fears that the ""backstop"" to avoid a hard land border for Northern Ireland would pull the province away from its constitutional anchor to the United Kingdom.
British officials have said their problems with the EU-proposed backstop go beyond language and point out that Prime Minister Theresa May's Northern Irish allies, strong supporters of the union with Britain, will not be easily mollified.
""We are willing to look at how we can de-dramatize the problem,"" one EU official said. ""We are willing to improve (the draft protocol).""
Another said work was now fully under way on a new text before May meets the other EU leaders at a summit in Salzburg next week. 
However, as Barnier's boss European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told the European Parliament earlier on Wednesday, the EU is not willing to go along with British proposals that it believes would give UK business a free-ride back-door entry to the EU single market or to let EU member Ireland suffer as a result of Brexit.

At the same time, Juncker stressed, the EU was looking to forge a very close partnership with Britain.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Thousands of Guatemalan police and soldiers locked down the center of the capital on Wednesday amid protests over the government's move to shutter a U.N.-backed anti-graft commission that has called for the president's impeachment.
More than 2,000 police and troops blocked off parts of the city center as farmers and students marched for a third day, carrying signs that said ""No more corruption"" and demanded the resignation of Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales.
Late last month, Morales said the country would not renew the mandate of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) that had brought down his predecessor and also tried to have Morales impeached. The United Nations has expressed serious concerns about the decision. 
""We demand the president let the CICIG continue. We do not want more corruption,"" said Cirilo Perez, a local indigenous leader who helped organize protests.
Working with Guatemala's attorney general, the CICIG in 2017 sought to prosecute Morales, a former comedian, over illegal financing allegations during his election campaign two years earlier.
The government has now given the commission a year to exit the country and last week officials barred the CICIG's head Ivan Velasquez from entering the country.
Demonstrators are also protesting two legislative initiatives that lawmakers who back Morales are aiming to pass in the coming days.
One bill would limit the ability of investigators to strip politicians of their immunity from prosecution and another would permit almost 80 congressmen who have defected from the opposition to join Morales' party.
In August, the nation's Supreme Court decided to consider a request to strip Morales of his immunity for his alleged participation in illegal electoral financing. The proceeding, supported by the CICIG, is the third against him.
Lawmakers propose to transfer the oversight of immunity proceedings to Congress from the Supreme Court and to limit such bids to only one request.
Morales' predecessor is in prison and standing trial for allegedly running a customs racket uncovered by the CICIG. Last year, the commission started investigating members of Morales' family for alleged corruption and supported impeaching him.
Morales denies any wrongdoing and says the CICIG has overstepped its remit.
Morales' credibility has suffered due to the CICIG's investigations, and he has aligned himself more closely with U.S. President Donald Trump by backing his decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Palestinian citizens are trapped in an economy of jobless growth with no prospects, especially in Gaza, which is undergoing ""de-development"", the United Nations trade and development agency UNCTAD said in an annual report published on Wednesday.
It said unemployment in the Palestinian territories was the highest in the world in 2017, at 27.4 percent, while agricultural production fell by 11 percent. Half of Palestinians under 30 were unemployed. The economy grew 3.1 percent but was flat on a per capita basis.
“Every year the situation becomes more and more unacceptable and difficult,” UNCTAD Deputy Secretary-General Isabelle Durant told a news conference in Geneva, describing the economic situation as ""absolutely unsustainable"". 
A customs union between Israel and the Palestinian territories has isolated the Palestinian economy from the rest of the world and left it dependent on Israel, the report said. 
“The major reason for this dark situation from the economic development point of view is a set of Israeli restrictions,"" Mahmoud Elkhafif, coordinator of the report, said. 
""These measures include permit systems for Palestinians to work in Israel, you have road blocks in the West Bank, you have earth mounds, trenches, road check points, gates and separation barriers.”
In Gaza, where real incomes have fallen 30 percent since 1999 and production capacity has been hit by successive military operations, households got an average of two hours of electricity daily, and only about 10 percent had drinking water.
""It is de-development, it is not development,"" Elkhafif said. 
Hamas, an Islamist movement designated a terrorist group by Western countries and Israel, seized control of the territory in 2007 following a brief civil war with forces loyal to Mahmoud Abbas, the Western-backed Palestinian president based in the West Bank.
Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, but, citing security concerns, maintains tight control of its land and sea borders. Egypt also restricts movement in and out of Gaza on its border.
Abbas’s Palestinian Authority has also sought to use financial measures to isolate Hamas, last year slashing the salaries of thousands of government workers in Gaza by 30 percent.
Total international support dropped significantly, from $2 billion in 2008 to $720 million in 2017.
A further blow came this month when U.S. President Donald Trump halted funding for the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, leaving a $200 million gap.

Durant said it was too early to assess the impact of the U.S. move, and she hoped European or other donors might at least partially make up the shortfall.

Alain Goma, 54, has been in prison in the capital Sanaa, which is under Houthi control, after being transferred from the Red Sea port.
His detention is complicated politically for Paris.
France has been trying to play a role to help alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Yemen by engaging with the Iran-aligned Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition fighting against the group.
However, France, like other Western countries, is friendly to countries fighting against the Houthis. Along with the United States and Britain, it sells weapons to the coalition leaders Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
""Every effort is being made to get his release,"" the source said. ""France's ambassador for Yemen Christian Testot is in contact with authorities responsible for his arrest so that he can be freed as quickly as possible."" 
When asked whether Paris considered that he was being held hostage by the Houthis, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll avoided responding.
She said that the ministry was aware of Goma's situation as well as two other compatriots held by the Houthis. Two Franco-Tunisian have been held by the Houthis since 2014.
Speaking to Le Figaro on Tuesday, Goma's sister, Christine, said she had been able to speak to her brother twice since June and that he had told her he had been accused of being a spy and was beginning to break down.
""Do something, Mr President (Emmanuel Macron), so that my brother does not remain a forgotten hostage,"" Christine Goma told the newspaper. 
Testot traveled to Sanaa in the summer after Paris was forced to downgrade an international humanitarian conference on Yemen.
The Houthis control Yemen's capital Sanaa and most of its populated areas, while the Arab states are fighting on behalf of an exiled government that has authority in the south.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - As Palestinians prepare to lower the flag over their shuttered mission in Washington, no one can predict when they will return to the city where just a quarter of a century ago a diplomatic triumph was celebrated on a sunlit White House lawn.
Hosted by then-U.S. President Bill Clinton, Palestinian and Israeli leaders came together on Sept. 13, 1993 to sign the first of the Oslo Accords, designed to be the foundation of a permanent peace deal within five years that would create two states, side-by-side.
The three men who would win the Nobel Peace Prize the next year - Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres of Israel and Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser Arafat - did not live to see peace in their time.
Now, with relations between U.S. President Donald Trump and the Palestinians, who see him as an unquestioning ally of right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at a breaking point, the Oslo deal seems like a relic from a bygone age.
As if to drive home the flaws inherent in Oslo's original Declaration of Principles, 25 years later it is the very issues that were postponed for later resolution that are now dominating the headlines once again.
They include the status of Jerusalem - claimed by both sides as their capital, the fate of millions of Palestinian refugees from wars dating to 1948, Israeli settlements on occupied land that Palestinians want for a state, mutually acceptable security arrangements, and the issue of agreed borders.
“I believe now that Oslo is dead,” said Yasser Abed Rabbo, who was among the tiny circle of Palestinian politicians entrusted by Arafat with the secret that Israeli and Palestinian negotiators had begun meeting in Norway in 1992.
Now 73, Abed Rabbo concedes his side made mistakes. Now, few even talk of a peace process. Last month, support for a two-state solution fell to 43 percent among Israeli Jews and Palestinians in one opinion poll, the weakest in almost two decades of joint Palestinian-Israeli survey research.
“We should not mourn a ghost,"" Abed Rabbo said. ""We should have a new strategy - not to abandon the right of self-determination for the Palestinian people, not to abandon the right to build our own independent state, but to try to find ways and means to reach that goal different from the ways and means that we have used in the past.”
But Yossi Beilin, one of the Israeli negotiators in the Oslo talks, said the parameters of a final agreement are well-known.
""It shouldn't take too long, once the right people are in their positions, to cut a deal,"" Beilin, 70, told Reuters.
""Trump is not a game-changer - he is a spoiler ... but he will not be there forever. And I believe that it is eventually, as it was in Oslo, up to the parties. If we and the Palestinians want to make peace, we will make peace.""
EARLY CHALLENGES
The early hope of peace shattered quickly after Rabin and Arafat awkwardly shook hands on the South Lawn.
Two years later, Rabin was assassinated by an Israeli ultra-nationalist opposed to peace policies that had already been tested by the massacre of 29 Palestinian worshippers by a Jewish settler in the West Bank city of Hebron, and by suicide bombings by the Hamas and Islamic Jihad militant groups that killed 77 civilians and soldiers in Israel and the occupied Gaza Strip.
Over the years, peacemaking became mired in accusations of broken promises on both sides and more attacks by Palestinian militants, and continued settlement expansion, movement restrictions, arrests and military incursions by Israel.
At the end of 2017, the United Nations said there were 611,000 Israelis living in 250 settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, both of which were captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. Most countries view those settlements as illegal. Israel disputes this.
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014. Trump has pledged a ""deal of the century"" to end the decades-old conflict.
For his part, Netanyahu has said that any future Palestinian state must be demilitarized and must recognize Israel as the state of the Jewish people - conditions that Palestinians say show he is not sincere about peacemaking.
And Palestinians fumed when Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December and moved the U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv in May.
Both steps and led the Palestinian leadership to boycott Washington's peace efforts spearheaded by Jared Kushner, Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law. 
Further moves saw the Trump administration withhold hundreds of millions of dollars of aid to the U.N. refugee agency dealing with Palestinians and to hospitals in East Jerusalem, and the order to close the Palestine Liberation Organization’s mission in Washington, which opened in 1994. 
In Gaza, ruled by the Islamist Hamas since 2007, two years after Israeli soldiers and settlers withdrew, one of the group's senior leaders, Mahmoud Al-Zahar, said the Oslo deal was not a peace pact but ""100 percent surrender"" for the Palestinians.

Lucy Bar-On, a 60-year-old Israeli nurse, said the failure to move forward along the peace path charted by the interim agreements only emboldened hardliners: ""They won, the extremists on the Israeli side and those on the Palestinian side.""

ANKARA/AMMAN (Reuters) - Turkey is reinforcing its military posts inside Syria's rebel-held province of Idlib, Turkish and Syrian rebels sources say, seeking to deter a government offensive which it says would unleash a humanitarian disaster on its border.
President Tayyip Erdogan has warned that an assault by the army and its Russian and Iran-backed allies on Idlib, home to around 3 million people, will uproot hundreds of thousands in one of Syria's last rebel strongholds.
Already hosting 3.5 million Syrians - the world's biggest refugee population - Turkey says it cannot absorb more victims of the war and has accused the West of abandoning it to face the consequences of President Bashar al-Assad's reconquest of Syria.
At a meeting in Tehran on Friday with the presidents of Russia and Iran, seen as the last realistic chance to avert all-out conflict in the insurgent-held region, Erdogan failed to win a pledge of ceasefire from Assad's two main backers.
But his Defence Minister Hulusi Akar says Turkey remains determined to halt the weeks-long air strikes on Idlib and forestall a ground offensive, while officials warn that Turkey would respond if its forces inside Idlib come under fire.
Three Turkish security and government officials told Reuters that troops, armored vehicles and equipment had been sent to the Syrian border. A senior security source said the army has reinforced 12 Turkish military posts inside Idlib itself.
""We have a military presence there and if that military presence is damaged or attacked in any way, it would be considered an attack on Turkey and would therefore receive the necessary retaliation,"" the source said.
The observation posts were set up in the Idlib region last year under an accord with Russia and Iran designating Idlib and parts of neighboring provinces a ""de-escalation zone"".
Three similar zones, on Syria's southern border with Jordan, to the east and to the north of Damascus, have since been recaptured by the Syrian army and its allies. 
A senior Syrian rebel said Turkey had sent dozens of armored vehicles and tanks, as well as hundreds of special forces personnel to Idlib, a move he said showed Idlib would not share the fate of the other rebel regions.
""There are very big reinforcements of Turkish forces inside Syria and these observation posts have now in effect become permanent military bases,"" Mustafa Sejari said.
The Turkish military does not comment on troop movements, but Reuters television footage has shown military convoys heading to the border region in the last week.
Rebel sources told Reuters that Turkey has also stepped up supplies to the rebel forces in Idlib in recent days, including ammunition and rockets. 
NO REFUGEES
Although it opened its doors to Syrians escaping the fighting in the early years of the conflict, Turkey has since built a wall along its 900 km (560 mile) border with Syria.
It says it cannot take more refugees, and Turkish aid and security officials say that in the event of conflict in Idlib they would seek to shelter displaced people inside Syria rather than hosting them on Turkish soil. 
""The refugees ... will not be accepted into Turkey because previous experiences have shown that with such migrant waves, the entrance of radicals and terrorists into Turkey have been too much,"" the security official said.
""We will keep the refugees in Syria for the safety of both Turkey and European countries."" 
U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said two weeks ago there were an estimated 10,000 fighters in Idlib designated by the United Nations as terrorists. 
There are also tens of thousands of rebels from Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army groups as well as millions of civilians - many already displaced from other parts of Syria.
Turkey has said for months that jihadi fighters, who control several major towns in Idlib, should be specifically targeted to avoid the humanitarian consequences of an indiscriminate war. 
Thousands of Syrians are already sheltering in camps close to the Idlib border, relying on proximity to Turkey to protect them from Syrian or Russian air strikes. 
The security source said Turkey was preparing more camps, but said discussions were still continuing about the scale of the aid operation inside Syria. 
Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said a refugee influx across Turkey's borders would have international repercussions.
Ankara reached a deal with the European Union two years ago to stem the flow of migrants crossing the Mediterranean into Europe, after the influx caused a political crisis in the bloc.
""The global community also needs to take responsibility,"" Kalin said after a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. ""Another migrant wave coming to Turkey at a time when we already host millions of refugees will cause other complications,"" he said.""
""This will spread from here to Europe and other countries.""

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 12:53PM ET</span>","Pompeo says Saudi, UAE trying to avoid civilian harm in Yemen","By Jonathan Landay
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that he certified to Congress that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were working to reduce civilian casualties in Yemen, avoiding a limitation on U.S. help for its ally Saudi Arabia.
Without the certification, U.S. tanker aircraft would have been restricted in the refueling of Saudi-led coalition aircraft conducting strikes against Houthi rebels backed by Iran.
Pompeo's decision drew the derision of critics of the Saudi-led air campaign, which has long been denounced even by Western allies for causing massive civilian casualties and driving Yemen to the brink of famine. 
The 3-year-old war in Yemen, widely seen as a proxy battle between regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran, has killed more than 10,000 people. 
Pompeo said in a statement he advised Congress on Tuesday that ""the governments of Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates are undertaking demonstrable actions to reduce the risk of harm to civilians and civilian infrastructure resulting from military operations of these governments.""  
He provided no details of the measures taken by Saudi Arabia and the UAE that underpinned his decision.
Last month, a Saudi airstrike on a bus killed dozens of people, including 40 children.
""Pompeo’s ‘certification’ is a farce. The Saudis deliberately bombed a bus full of children. There is only one moral answer, and that is to end our support for their intervention in Yemen,"" Democratic U.S. Representative Ro Khanna said in a post on Twitter. 
U.S. lawmakers, concerned about a growing humanitarian disaster in Yemen, required Pompeo to certify by Wednesday that the Saudis and the UAE were taking meaningful measures to reduce civilian casualties and allow humanitarian aid deliveries.
Without the move by Pompeo, U.S. aircraft would have been barred from refueling Saudi-led coalition aircraft in mid-air except when they were striking Yemeni factions of al Qaeda and Islamic State, the Houthis' use of ballistic missiles, or protecting U.S. military units and international commercial shipping.
U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis said he backed Pompeo's finding.
Saudi Arabia is leading a Western-backed alliance of Sunni Muslim Arab states to try to restore the internationally recognized government of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, ousted from the capital Sanaa by the Iran-aligned Houthis in 2015.
An attempt to convene U.N.-mediated peace talks in Geneva collapsed last weekend after the Houthi delegation failed to show up for three days. 
The United States and other Western powers provide arms and intelligence to the alliance. Human rights groups have criticized them over coalition air strikes that have killed hundreds of civilians at hospitals, schools and markets.
“The coalition has promised over and over again to end unlawful attacks, to credibly investigate, to provide civilian victims redress. It hasn’t, instead continuing to bomb weddings, homes, markets, a bus filled with children just a month ago,"" said Kristine Beckerle of Human Rights Watch.

The Pentagon believes that its assistance, which includes refueling coalition jets and training in targeting, helps reduce civilian casualties.

The test of the Aegis system, by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), ""provides confidence in the future capability for Japan to defeat the developing threats in the region,"" said Lieutenant General Sam Greaves, director of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency (MDA).
Japan last year decided to expand its ballistic missile defense capabilities with the U.S.-made Aegis system in response to what it said was a growing threat from North Korean rockets.
Tokyo is wary of North Korean promises to abandon its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs and considers Pyongyang its most serious threat even as U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed progress on denuclearization. Trump has also pushed Japan to buy more U.S. military gear and other goods. 
""We are committed to assisting the government of Japan in upgrading its national missile defense capability against emerging threats,"" Greaves said.
Japan has also said its missile defense systems are for self-defense only and do not pose a threat to Russia, which has expressed concern over efforts to establish a U.S. missile defense system in the region. 
On Wednesday, Russia made a dramatic offer to formally end World War Two hostilities between their countries, an overture clouded by a decades-old dispute over an island chain in the Pacific Ocean.
In the test on Tuesday, a simple, separating ballistic missile launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility at Barking Sands in Kauai, Hawaii, was intercepted above the Pacific by an upgraded standard missile 3, the MDA said.

(Reuters) - A federal judge has struck down a 95-year-old California law banning firearms dealers from placing ads for handguns or images of handguns on their storefronts.
In a decision made public on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Troy Nunley in Sacramento, the state's capital, said the law was ""unconstitutional on its face"" because it violated dealers' commercial speech rights under the First Amendment.
State officials said allowing the ads could spur people with ""impulsive personality traits"" to buy more handguns, and the law advanced California's interests in reducing handgun crime and handgun suicides.
But Nunley found the law too narrow, saying dealers could still use print or radio ads or even display large neon signs trumpeting ""GUNS GUNS GUNS."" It was also too broad, by restricting speech to all adults regardless of their personality traits, he ruled.
""The government may not restrict speech that persuades adults, who are neither criminals nor suffer from mental illness, from purchasing a legal and constitutionally-protected product, merely because it distrusts their personality trait and the decisions that personality trait may lead them to make later down the road,"" the judge wrote.
Nunley was appointed by former U.S. President Barack Obama.
The office of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra had defended the law, which is part of the state's penal code.
Officials from the attorney general did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.
Nunley's decision is a victory for Tracy Rifle and Pistol, Ten Percent Firearms and other dealers that said the law infringed their right to display ""truthful, nonmisleading"" handgun ads, or risk fines or license revocations.
""It reaffirms the trend in the law that the Supreme Court has been very clear on, that government cannot restrict truthful advertising because it fears that law-abiding citizens will make decisions it doesn't approve of,"" Brad Benbrook, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview on Wednesday.

The case is Tracy Rifle and Pistol LLC et al v Harris et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of California, No. 14-02626.

The Hague will hold a hearing on Oct. 1 to announce its findings in the Bolivian lawsuit filed in 2013 that seeks to force Chile to negotiate an exit for Bolivia to the sea. 
Bolivia lost its access to the sea after a war with Chile in the 19th century, leading to Chile annexing Bolivia's coastline and leaving the latter landlocked. 
Bolivia, in the dispute, argued that Chile had not kept diplomatic promises and obligations it made under international law to negotiate sea access, namely a land corridor and port under its control.
""The court must invoke a dialogue and a good faith negotiation on all the issues offered by Chile for almost a century,"" Bolivian President Evo Morales said in a televised statement from the city of Cochabamba on Wednesday. 
Chile had argued in The Hague it had no obligation to negotiate access for Bolivia to the Pacific Ocean, saying the matter had been settled by a peace treaty more than a decade ago.
Chilean President Sebastian Pinera maintained on Wednesday that the issue of the border had been resolved ""clearly and categorically"" in the peace treaty. He made the comments at a public appearance to announce the expansion of Google's data center in Quilicura.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The Catholic Church in Germany acknowledged a ""depressing and shameful"" legacy of sexual abuse on Wednesday after a leaked study said clerics had abused thousands of children over a 70-year period.
The document, commissioned by the German Bishops' Conference, revealed that 1,670 clerics and priests had sexually abused 3,677 minors, mostly males, in the country between 1946 and 2014, Der Spiegel said.
The news magazine quoted a leaked copy of the study, which was compiled by three German universities.
Bishop of Trier Stephan Ackermann said the Church was aware of the extent of abuse demonstrated by the study's results. 
""It is depressing and shameful for us,"" he said in a statement on Wednesday.
The leaked study was published on the day that Pope Francis, who has made several attempts to tackle a spreading sexual abuse crisis that has badly tarnished the Church's image, summoned senior bishops from around the world to the Vatican to discuss the protection of minors.
The Vatican had no immediate comment on the Spiegel report.
The magazine said the study, which examined more than 38,000 files from 27 dioceses, showed more than half of the victims were aged 13 years or under when they were abused.
About one in six of cases documented involved rape and three quarters of the victims were abused in a church or through a pastoral relationship with the abuser. In many cases, evidence was destroyed or manipulated, it cited the study as saying.
The Bishops' Conference was expected to present the ""strictly confidential"" study's findings later this month, Spiegel said.
Speaking on behalf of the Conference, Bishop Ackermann said that, while he regretted that the study had been leaked, he was convinced its survey were comprehensive and thorough.
""The study is a course of action which we owe not only to the Church, but above all and foremost to those affected,"" Ackermann said.
The Church had often transferred clerics accused of sexual abuse without providing the new host community with ""appropriate information"" about them, the study found.
Only one third of those accused had to face proceedings under canon law and sanctions imposed were at most minimal, with 4 percent of those found to have committed abuse still working.
The study called on the Catholic Church to rethink its refusal to consecrate homosexual men and to view the celibacy obligation imposed on its clergy as ""a potential risk factor"", Der Spiegel reported.

Last month, a U.S. grand jury released study findings showing 301 Catholic priests in Pennsylvania had sexually abused minors over 70 years.

The court handed down the death sentences on Sept. 8 to regime opponents linked to a 2013 sit-in that ended with security forces killing hundreds of protesters. Among those convicted were prominent Islamist leaders Essam al-Erian and Mohamed Beltagi. 
""We call on the Egyptian authorities to suspend the execution of these convictions,"" Foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes Von der Muhll said in a daily online briefing.
Paris has rarely rebuked Cairo in public on human rights since President Emmanuel Macron came to power in May, 2017.
France, and in particular Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian, enjoys close relations with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, and those ties have become stronger amid worries over the political vacuum in Libya and the threat from jihadist groups in Egypt.

GENEVA (Reuters) - U.N. investigators said on Wednesday that they had documented three further uses of banned chlorine weapons by Syrian government forces that constituted war crimes, and urged major powers to help avert a ""massacre"" in the final battle for Idlib.
The attacks caused injuries in the Damascus suburb of Douma and in Idlib in the northwest in January and early February, they said in their latest report.
They said they were still investigating a suspected chemical attack in Douma on April 7 that killed at least 49 people and wounded up to 650.
The United Nations has warned of a potential humanitarian catastrophe in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, if an expected offensive is carried out by the Syrian government and its allied Russian forces. 
""The Commission of Inquiry demands that all parties to the conflict and those states who support them do everything in their power to prevent a massacre in Idlib,"" the war crimes investigators said in a statement read out by panel chairman Paulo Pinheiro to a news conference. 
They had no information that chemical agents might be used against the 2.9 million civilians living in Idlib, half of them refugees from elsewhere in Syria. The pocket is controlled by tens of thousands of rebel fighters, including around 10,000 Islamists designated as terrorists by the world body.
However, the three new cases bring to 33 the number of chemical attacks that the independent panel has documented since 2013 and attributed to the government, a U.N. official said. The use of chlorine in Douma on April 7, for which Western powers have blamed Syria, came as the government and its allies were in a final push to drive rebels out of the eastern Ghouta region.
""MUCH STRONGER RESPONSE""
John Bolton, U.S. President Donald Trump's national security adviser, said on Monday that the United States, Britain and France had agreed that another use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government would result in a ""much stronger response"" than previous such incidents.
The April attack resulted in U.S., British and French missile strikes on sites believed to be linked to Syria's chemical weapons program.
Pinheiro said the latest reports of air strikes on rebel-held areas of Idlib followed a previous pattern of ""targeting civilian infrastructure and medical facilities"":
""For months we have been saying this concentration of population and armed groups transported or transferred to Idlib was a (time) bomb.""
Chlorine was dropped by government helicopters in Saraqeb in Idlib on Feb. 4, injuring at least 11 men, the report said, while women and children were injured in the Jan. 22 and Feb. 1 attacks on Douma.
""The Commission concludes that, on these two occasions, government forces and/or affiliated militias committed the war crimes of using prohibited weapons and launching indiscriminate attacks in civilian-populated areas in eastern Ghouta,"" it said.
The use of chlorine as a weapon is prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention.
In addition to the 33 uses of chlorine weapons attributed to the government, the perpetrators of six others have not been sufficiently identified.

On the April 7 attack, the panel said the evidence so far pointed to a gas cylinder dropped by helicopter having struck a residential apartment building.

Ibrahim Jathran damaged peace and stability in Libya by overseeing forces that attacked Libyan oil facilities in the ""oil crescent,"" a lucrative target for rogue militias and criminals, the department said. 
It said the militia had caused many fatalities in Libya this year.
""Jathran’s repeated militia attacks on Libya’s oil facilities have done colossal damage to its economy and robbed the Libyan people of billions of dollars in oil revenue,"" said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.
He said Jathran's attacks have affected Libyan oil exports since 2013.
Forces led by Jathran violently attacked and seized control of the Libyan oil ports Ras Lanuf and Al Sidra in June, the department said, costing Libya more than $1.4 billion in revenue and setting back efforts to promote political progress and stability.
The U.N. Security Council Libya sanctions committee blacklisted Jathran on Tuesday, subjecting him to a global asset freeze and travel ban.
Jathran is sought by judicial authorities in Tripoli for blockades of oil terminals and attempts to export oil independently.
Libya, which has been in turmoil since a 2011 uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi, has been divided between rival governments and military factions based in the east and west of the country since 2014, causing political deadlock and an economic crisis.

Armed groups regularly block oilfields to make demands. Several armed men attacked the headquarters of Libya’s National Oil Corporation in the capital Tripoli on Monday, killing at least two staff members, a security official said. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.

Nobody was hurt by the rocket fire late on Tuesday which missed all aircraft, but the violence undermined a fragile truce between the groups in Tripoli which the United Nations brokered last week.
Some groups based outside Tripoli have attacked rival factions based in the capital to gain access to public funds and businesses linked to militias, a recurring theme in the OPEC oil producer since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
Matiga airport, a former air base used for commercial flights since the main airport was heavily damaged in 2014 by militia fighting, said it had moved planes and crews to Misrata, a city east of Tripoli.
""All flights will be from and to Misrata International Airport,"" Matiga airport said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
U.N. envoy Ghassan Salame said a new security arrangement would be implemented in the next few days despite the incident. ""We know exactly who is bombing Matiga airport ... once four days ago and then last night ... I will name him next time,"" Salame told reporters.
He gave no details on the planned security deal which is likely to add more groups to the public payroll to win their loyalty, a strategy that has failed in the past as it only attracted other players.
Rival groups fought for several days in Tripoli until last week but the clashes had been mainly in the south of the city, whereas Matiga airport lies in an eastern suburb.
Salame has been pursuing a plan, backed by France, to hold elections this year though the House of Representatives based in the east and allied to a rival administration has failed to approve the constitutional framework and legislation so far.
Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez Seraj said conditions were too unstable to hold a vote. ""You cannot vote with instability in the streets ... it is necessary that everyone accepts the result of the ballot,"" he told the Italian daily Corriere della Sera.

1336,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 11:03AM ET</span>",Fighting resumes in Yemen's Hodeidah as peace talks stall,"ADEN/GENEVA (Reuters) - A Saudi-led coalition launched air strikes on the outskirts of Yemen's main port city of Hodeidah as heavy fighting resumed days after U.N.-sponsored talks between the warring parties collapsed, military sources and residents said on Wednesday.
A senior Yemeni source in the coalition told Reuters that the alliance had renewed an offensive to take control of the city from the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement after an attempt to hold peace talks in Geneva was abandoned on Saturday when the Houthi delegation failed to show up.
The renewed attacks on the port city, a lifeline for millions of Yemenis, could put further pressure on U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths, who has vowed to press ahead with diplomacy.
Yemeni military forces allied with the coalition said the battles outside Hodeidah began on Monday but intensified on Wednesday.
Coalition warplanes launched air strikes on Wednesday near the eastern gate of the city that leads to roads linking it with the capital Sanaa and Taiz province, residents said. 
Coalition-backed troops are trying to take control of the main route between Hodeidah and Sanaa in order to cut off supplies to the Houthi-held capital, they said.
""This is a renewal of the offensive to take Hodeidah. Everyone thought Hodeidah is impossible, and we will prove them wrong,"" the senior Yemeni coalition source said.
Brigadier General Sharaf Luqman, a spokesman for the Yemeni armed forces allied with the Houthis, said they had launched attacks against coalition-backed forces on the west coast, Iran's Tasnim news agency reported on Wednesday.
The Western-backed alliance intervened in Yemen's war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognized government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Coalition forces retook much of the south before the war, widely seen as a proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran, bogged down.
The coalition, led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, launched an offensive to seize Hodeidah in June in the largest battle of the conflict, but called it off after little gains to give peace talks a chance.
""The Houthi NO SHOW at the Geneva peace process is further proof that the liberation of Hodeidah is what is needed to bring them to their senses & constructively engage in the political process,"" UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said in Twitter post.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement on Wednesday that he had certified to Congress that Saudi Arabia and the UAE were working to avoid harming civilians in Yemen, clearing the way for continued U.S. help for its ally Saudi Arabia.
The United Nations fears an attack on Hodeidah, the entry point for the bulk of Yemen's commercial imports and aid supplies, could trigger a famine in the impoverished state where an estimated 8.4 million people are facing starvation.
Griffiths is heading to Oman on Wednesday to meet Houthi leaders, and then to Sanaa, his spokeswoman Hoda El-Turk said.
""We want to go to Muscat to find out ... how do we arrange things in a different way so that both parties can sit down together next time around,"" Griffiths told reporters in Geneva on Saturday.
Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi accused the coalition of blocking his movement's team from traveling to the peace talks. The foreign minister of Hadi's government, Khaled al-Yamani, accused the Houthis of ""trying to sabotage the negotiations"".

The Yemen war has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced more than 2 million, according to the United Nations.

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 10:48AM ET</span>",EU parliament pushes Hungary sanctions over Orban policies,"By Alastair Macdonald
STRASBOURG (Reuters) - The European Parliament voted on Wednesday to sanction Hungary for flouting EU rules on democracy, civil rights and corruption in an unprecedented step that left Prime Minister Viktor Orban isolated from powerful allies.
Hungary said it would seek legal ways to challenge the 448-197 vote it described as ""petty revenge"".
Delivering more than the two-thirds majority required as many of Orban's allies in the conservative party deserted him, the vote, however, has little chance of ending up with the ultimate penalty of Hungary being suspended from voting in the EU. If nothing else, its Polish ally would veto that.
But the 197 votes cast against the parliament's first bid to launch the punitive process of the EU treaty's Article 7 highlighted the substantial minority of European opinion who see Orban as a crusader for the rights of nation states and ethnic majorities against rules of civic behavior agreed in Brussels.
Since sweeping to power in 2010, Orban, once a campaigner against Hungary's Soviet Communist overlords, has used his parliamentary majority to pressure courts, media and non-government groups in ways his opponents say breach EU rules. 
He has also led opposition to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and others who want Europe to take in more Muslim refugees.
""Today's European Parliament decision was nothing else but a petty revenge of pro-immigration politicians against Hungary,"" Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told a news conference in Budapest. ""The decision was made in a fraudulent way, and contrary to relevant rules in European treaties.""
As abstaining votes had not been counted, he said that changed the outcome of the vote.
With Britain about to leave the bloc altogether in March and Europeans voting in European Parliament elections in May, the row over Hungary -- and Poland, which faces a similar sanctions procedure launched by the executive European Commission in 2017 -- highlights tensions between nationalist and federalist camps.
In France, where President Emmanuel Macron is campaigning for next year's European elections in direct opposition to Orban, an Elysee source said the vote ""was a good signal"".
""HERO"" 
Judith Sargentini, the Dutch Greens lawmaker who steered the proposal through, said after the historic vote: ""Viktor Orban's government has been leading the charge against European values by silencing independent media, replacing critical judges, and putting academia on a leash. 
""Individuals close to the government have been enriching themselves, their friends and family members at the expense of Hungarian and European taxpayers,"" she said. ""The Hungarian people deserve better."" 
Sargentini praised support for her motion from much of Orban's European People's Party in the chamber -- the EPP includes Merkel's Christian Democrats -- and she called on governments in the EU's Council to now take the unprecedented step of sanctioning a fellow member.
Orban had flown to Strasbourg personally on Tuesday to intervene in the debate, delivering a fiery speech that he would not give in to ""blackmail"" and describing the motion as an insult to Hungarians. But his failure to offer any compromise cost him support within the EPP, party officials said. 
The group may now consider whether to suspend Orban's Fidesz party. Szijjarto said Fidesz was committed to staying in the EPP but would seek ways to transform its stance from the inside.
All the applause for the Hungarian leader on Tuesday came from the far right of the chamber, notably among supporters of France's Marine Le Pen and the UK Independence Party.
Geert Wilders, the leader of the Dutch anti-immigration Freedom Party, called the vote - which also weighed on Hungarian assets - ""a bloody shame"". 
""Orban is a hero,"" he said. ""He closed the borders for Islamic fortune seekers. He protects his citizens against terror and defends the identity of his country.""

The Commission has preferred to pressure Budapest through standard legal powers, but the head of the EU executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, also an EPP member, said he would have voted for the move if he were a lawmaker.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish intelligence has seized a man in Syria suspected of coordinating a 2013 bombing that killed 53 people in southern Turkey, a Turkish security official said on Wednesday.
The state-run news agency Anadolu said that during his questioning, Yusuf Nazik confessed to having received orders from Syrian intelligence to plan an attack in Turkey and having arranged the transport of explosives into Turkey.
Twin car bombs ripped through the border town of Reyhanli on May 11, 2013. At the time, Turkey accused a group loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad of carrying out the attacks. Damascus denied any involvement.
Nazik was captured in Syria's government-controlled city of Latakia by members of Turkey's National Intelligence Agency (MIT) and repatriated to Turkey with the support of the Turkish armed forces, the security official said. 
The official said no intelligence or logistic aid was received from any foreign state during the operation. It was not clear when Nazik was apprehended and repatriated.
There was no reaction to the arrest in Syrian state media.
Turkish Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul praised the operation by the intelligence agency.
""Wherever the criminal is, whichever terror organization it is, our state will of course follow it to the end and deliver the punishment to those who deserve it before the independent judiciary,"" he said.
Turkey has recently seized or brought back numerous people wanted for involvement with the network of the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, which Ankara says was responsible for a failed July 2016 coup attempt. Gulen denies any involvement.
In February, 22 people were jailed in connection with the 2013 bombing, Anadolu said.
Reyhanli is home to thousands of Syrian refugees. Following a series of bombings in the region in 2013, Turkey tightened controls along its 900-km (560-mile) border with Syria.

Turkey has been one of the biggest supporters of the rebels fighting Syrian government forces during the seven-year conflict in Syria. It hosts some 3.5 million Syrian refugees.

VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday Russia had found the two men accused by British prosecutors of trying to murder ex- Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Britain, but that there was nothing criminal about them.
British prosecutors last week identified two Russians they said were operating under aliases - Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - whom they accused of trying to murder the Skripals with a military-grade nerve agent in England.
The duo had entered Britain on genuine passports, prosecutors said, while British Prime Minister Theresa May described them as military intelligence officers almost certainly acting on orders from high up in the Russian state.
Putin, speaking at an economic forum in the Russian Pacific port city of Vladivostok, said Russia had located the two men, but that there was nothing special or criminal about them.
""We of course checked who these people are. We know who they are, we found them. Well, I hope they will come out themselves and speak about themselves. It will be better for everyone,"" said Putin, responding to a question about the case. 
""There's nothing special and criminal about it, I assure you. We'll see soon... They are civilians of course. I would like to appeal to them so that they hear us today. They will come somewhere, to you, the mass media..."" 
Hours after Putin spoke, Russian state TV said one of the two men, Petrov, had told it by phone that he might comment on the case next week. 
Asked about Putin's remarks, Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said Britain's attempts to get an explanation from Russia over the poisoning of the Skripals had always been met with obfuscation and lies and that had not changed.
""These men are officers of the Russian military intelligence service, the GRU ... The government has exposed the role of the GRU, its operatives and its methods, this position is supported by our international allies,"" the spokesman told reporters.
""We have repeatedly asked Russia to account for what happened in Salisbury in March and they have replied with obfuscation and lies. I can see nothing to suggest that has changed.""
""SIMPLE PEOPLE""
Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement in the poisoning, casting it as part of a Western plot to smear Russia to justify more sanctions against it.
The Kremlin said on Wednesday that Putin had not spoken to the two accused men and refused to say how and by whom they had been found.
Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the Russian leader had merely voiced a hope that they would appear publicly in the future. “Let’s wait for that moment,” Peskov told reporters. 
Viktoria Skripal, the niece of Sergei Skripal, said last week she did not know anything about the two men. She told the Interfax news agency on Wednesday she now knew through sources she did not name that they were ""simple people"".
""I knew from day one that this story about the involvement of Petrov and Boshirov was fake,"" she said.
While one of the two accused, Boshirov, looked like a photograph released by Britain, the other, Petrov, looked nothing like the other photograph and had not been in Britain at the time of the attempted poisoning incident, she added.
Skripal - a former GRU colonel who betrayed dozens of agents to Britain's MI6 foreign intelligence service - and his daughter were found slumped unconscious on a bench in the English city of Salisbury in March. They spent weeks in hospital before being discharged.
Britain and dozens of other countries kicked out scores of Russian diplomats over the poisoning of the Skripals, and Moscow responded tit-for-tat with an identical number of expulsions. The affair worsened Russian relations with the West, already under strain over Ukraine, Syria and other issues.

The affair returned to the headlines in July when a woman near Salisbury, Dawn Sturgess, died and her partner Charlie Rowley fell ill after Rowley found a counterfeit bottle of Nina Ricci perfume containing the Novichok nerve agent and brought it home.

In a speech alongside other regional leaders, Hun Sen pointed to the international condemnation of his country's recent election, which was seen by many as a farce after the main opposition party was dissolved. He also cited the international outcry over the violence against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.
""Countries which are outside of the region always slap our heads and tell us what to do,"" Hun Sen said at a panel discussion with leaders from Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and Laos at the World Economic Forum on ASEAN in Hanoi.
""I raised this issue not as a message for any particular country, but I would like to say that these Mekong countries are the political victims, so I request outsiders of the region who don't know about the issues to let us solve our problems.""
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won all 125 parliamentary seats in a July general election, which the United Nations and some Western countries have said was flawed because of the lack of a credible opposition among other factors.
The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was dissolved late last year ahead of the election.
Hun Sen also said Myanmar, whose military has been accused by the United Nations of carrying out mass killings and gang rape on Rohingya Muslims with ""genocidal intent,"" was misunderstood.
Myanmar has denied allegations of atrocities, saying its military carried out justifiable actions against militants. 
""It's accused of genocide, but do you all understand about Myanmar? Do you know about Myanmar? They have to solve a lot of challenging issues in relation with security,"" Hun Sen said.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's 5-Star Movement denied on Wednesday that it had threatened to demand Economy Minister Giovanni Tria's resignation unless he approved billions in spending next year for its flagship campaign promise.
Earlier in the day, state news agency Ansa reported that the job of Tria, an economics professor who is a member of neither party in the coalition government, was at risk.
On Tuesday, 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio said that if the 2019 budget did not include a universal income for the poor, ""it will be a problem for the government"". 
Then Stefano Buffagni, a cabinet undersecretary and 5-Star member, said on a TV talk show: ""I respect Tria, but he must respect the political forces that support him.""
The movement, which shares power with the far-right League, wants at least 10 billion euros ($11.6 billion) in spending to cover the universal income measure, a senior 5-Star source told Reuters.
However, 5-Star denied it was trying to remove Tria. ""That 5-Star is putting pressure on minister Tria is unfounded, as is any reference to his possible resignation,"" the group said in a statement.
Italian bond yields rose on the Ansa report, and held higher after the official denial, widening the gap with the benchmark German Bund yield.
MARKETS
The government took office in June and the two coalition parties have held a series of meetings in recent weeks to hammer out a compromise over next year's budget law.
For its part, the League is seeking sweeping tax cuts -- its main campaign pledge. Both parties also want to roll back a 2011 pension reform and head off a 12.4-billion-euro automatic VAT increase due next year. 
But to ease tensions in financial markets - which sold off Italian bonds amid fears that the government would go on a spending spree and fail to keep its mammoth debt in check - Tria and others came forward last week to say the main measures would be phased in over its five-year term.
Massimo Bitonci, an undersecretary at the economy ministry and a member of the League, said at the weekend that the coalition parties would have 5 billion euros each to implement their campaign promises in the 2019 budget.
The coalition is due to present Italy's latest economic growth and public finance targets by the end of the month, before a draft budget plan, which must be delivered in October.
Further complicating matters for the government are signs that the economy, the euro zone's third biggest, is slowing.
Industrial production fell sharply in July from the previous month, statistics office ISTAT said on Wednesday, taking the index to its lowest level since May of last year.
A slowing economy will make it even harder for the two parties to meet their campaign promises while keeping the country's debt, already worth more than 130 percent of annual output, under control.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has summoned senior Catholic bishops from around the world to the Vatican to discuss the protection of minors, in his latest attempt to come to grips with a spreading sexual abuse crisis.
The heads of the national Catholic bishops' conferences will meet with Francis from Feb. 21-24, a Vatican spokeswoman said.
The announcement came at the end of a three-day meeting of the ""C-9"", a group of nine cardinals from around the world who members meet about four times a year to advise the pope.
The spokeswoman said the sexual abuse crisis was a main topic at the meeting, which six of the members attended.
The Catholic Church is facing sexual abuse scandals in the United States, Chile, Australia and Germany, among others.
Der Spiegel magazine reported on Wednesday that a study commissioned by the German Bishops' Conference had revealed that 1,670 clerics and priests had sexually abused 3,677 minors, mostly males, in Germany over a 70-year period.
In the United States, a Grand Jury has found that 301 priests in the state of Pennsylvania sexually abused minors over a similar period.
Francis meets on Thursday with U.S. Church leaders to discuss that report as well as a scandal involving a former American cardinal and demands from an Italian archbishop, Carlo Maria Viganò, that the pontiff step down over that case.
CARDINAL'S MISCONDUCT 
Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the U.S. bishops' conference, asked for the meeting after Viganò last month accused the pope of knowing for years about sexual misconduct by former U.S. cardinal Theodore McCarrick and doing nothing about it..
Viganò said he had told Francis soon after the pontiff's election in 2013 that McCarrick, former archbishop of Washington D.C., had engaged in sexual misconduct with adult male seminarians. 
McCarrick resigned in July over separate allegations - which U.S. Church officials said were ""credible and substantiated"" - that he had abused a 16-year-old boy almost 50 years ago.
McCarrick, whom the pope ordered to live a life of seclusion and penitence, has said he has ""absolutely no recollection"" of such an incident. He has not commented on the allegations of misconduct with the adult seminarians. 
Hours after Viganò's statement was published, Francis told reporters that he would ""not say a word"" about it because it ""speaks for itself"". However, the Vatican is now preparing a response.
Cardinal Donald Wuerl, who succeeded McCarrick as archbishop of Washington D.C., told priests on Tuesday that he would travel to Rome to discuss his future with the pope.
Wuerl, 77, who was bishop of Pittsburgh between 1988 and 2006, has been under scrutiny over his handling of sexual abuse cases during the period addressed by the Pennsylvania Grand Jury.

Wuerl has defended his overall record in Pittsburgh, but has also been accused of knowing about sexual misconduct by McCarrick, which he denies.

The Laos government suspended approval of new dams and said it would review all dams currently under construction following the collapse of part of a hydropower project in southern Attapeu province that killed scores of people and drove many more from their homes.
""The impact of the incident in July is something that we will continue to take into account in moving forward in terms of our hydropower production,"" Thongloun Sisoulith said at a World Economic Forum event in Hanoi.
He said Laos will continue to study other options of renewable and clean energy generation such as solar panel and wind turbines.
Reports have suggested that Laos' hydropower potential could see it become the ""battery of Southeast Asia"" by selling power to neighbors.
Laos had 46 operating hydroelectric power plants in 2017, with 54 more planned or under construction, and sales of electricity abroad make up about 30 percent of its exports.
But Sisoulith said he did not agree with the ""battery"" tag.

""Our capacity to develop electricity in Laos compared to the demand of neighboring countries is very limited,"" he said.

Esfandiar Rahim Mashaie was sentenced to five years for threatening national security, one year for spreading propaganda against the Islamic Republic and six months for insulting judiciary officials, according to Tasnim.
Rahim Mashaie has long been a lightning rod for criticism from Iran's hardliners, in part because of a 2008 comment that the Islamic Republic is friendly with the people of its sworn foe Israel. 
When Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appointed Rahim Mashaie as his vice president in 2009, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, objected.
Ahmadinejad then appointed Rahim Mashaie, whose daughter is married to Ahmadinejad's son, as chief of staff. 
A top press aide to Ahmadinejad, Ali Akbar Javanfekr, also received a sentence of four years for threatening national security as part of the same case, Tasnim reported.
Tasnim did not provide any further details on the cases involving the aides to Ahmadinejad, who was president from 2005 until 2013, or when the offences they were convicted of occurred.
Rahim Mashaie was arrested in March and Javanfekr in August, the Iranian Students' News Agency reported

EU regulators have sought more powers to protect against privacy breaches since the data of millions of EU citizens were among those used by the British political consultancy to build profiles on voters and influence the U.S. presidential election in 2016. 
The proposal comes amid concerns that anti-EU parties or malign foreign actors will target the election to the EU legislature next year.
""We must protect our free and fair elections,"" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said in a keynote address to the European Parliament. He called for ""new rules to better protect our democratic processes from manipulation by third countries or private interests"".
The measure specifically targets political parties and political foundations with the threat of a fine of up to 5 per cent of their annual budget if they are found in breach of data protection rules with the aim of influencing a ballot.
To guard against disinformation campaigns, the Commission will also ask national governments to make online political advertising subject to stricter transparency rules. 
The draft plan still needs the approval of national governments and European Parliament to become law.
While voter targeting is not illegal, the proposed measures are in line with the EU's push to ensure that personal data is not used without consent.
The bloc adopted new privacy regulations that are among the world's toughest, requiring firms to be more cautious on how they handle customer data or face fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue or 20 million euros ($23.2 million).

The Commission has also proposed separate measures threatening fines against Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook, Twitter and other internet companies if they fail to remove extremist content within one hour.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Turkey has stepped up arms supplies to Syrian rebels to help them stave off an expected offensive by the Syrian army and its Russian and Iran-backed allies in the northwest near the Turkish frontier, rebel sources told Reuters.
Senior rebel officials said Turkey had sent more military aid to rebels in and around the Idlib region since a summit meeting with Iran and Russia last week failed to agree a deal to avert a government offensive into the area.
Turkey, which is already hosting 3.5 million Syrian refugees, is warning against such an attack, fearing it could force more Syrians over the border. President Tayyip Erdogan has warned of a humanitarian disaster and security risks for Turkey.
""They pledged complete Turkish military support for a long, protracted battle,"" a senior FSA commander who was privy to talks in recent days with senior Turkish officials said, requesting anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly. 
The weapons, which have entered Syria in large quantities in recent days, include ammunition and GRAD rockets.
""These arms supplies and munitions will allow the battle to extend and ensure our supplies are not drained in a war of attrition,"" the commander added.
A second rebel commander said: ""They are getting new shipments of munitions -- they don't need more than munitions."" 
""The Turks are making sure they have enough munitions that keep them going for a long while,"" he added. 
Turkish officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
AIR STRIKES
The Idlib area forms part of an arc of territory in the northwest representing the last big area held by the opposition.
Some three million people are living in Idlib, half of them Syrians who have fled from other parts of the country.
Russian and Syrian warplanes have stepped up air strikes on southern Idlib and adjacent areas of Hama province in an apparent prelude to a ground offensive. The Syrian army is building up troops near frontlines. 
Turkey has backed an array of Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels during the war that spiraled out of an uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. With decisive Iranian and Russian help, Assad has now recovered most of Syria.
Idlib's main towns and cities are under the sway of jihadists linked to al Qaeda's former Syrian affiliate, the Nusra Front, though they are outnumbered by Turkey-backed FSA fighters grouped under ""The National Front for Liberation"".
The Turkish army has also deployed in the last week more troops and heavy weaponary to 12 positions in the Idlib region that observe a ""de-escalation zone"" agreed with Iran and Russia. The Turkish army has also sent troops into Syrian rebel-held territory further east, in an area north of Aleppo city.
With extensive Turkish support, efforts have been underway to organize FSA groups north of Aleppo into a unified force known as the ""National Army"" numbering some 30,000 fighters.
Two rebel commanders said Turkey had ordered the bulk of this force to move toward the Idlib frontlines.
TEHRAN SUMMIT 
At the summit in Tehran, Erdogan, Russia's Vladimir Putin and Iran's Hassan Rouhani agreed in a statement that there could be no military solution to the conflict and it could only end through a negotiated political process.
But while Erdogan had also called for a truce, Putin said this would be pointless as it would not involve the Islamist militant groups that Russia deems terrorists, and Rouhani said Syria must regain control over all its territory.
Russia has said Turkey has the job of separating Islamist militants from the moderate opposition in Idlib.
Rebel sources said Turkey had pledged to take strong measures against the jihadists once Russia holds back the Syrian army from waging a major assault.

The jihadists have so far resisted calls by Ankara to dissolve themselves or take an offer that allows fighters to join FSA factions after breaking all ties to al Qaeda.

1352,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 08:52AM ET</span>",Swedish center-right pushes for power to break election deadlock,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The leaders of Sweden's center-right opposition Alliance urged the incumbent Social Democrat-led bloc on Wednesday to step aside and help them form a viable government to break a post-election deadlock.
Prime Minister and Social Democrat leader Stefan Lofven immediately rejected the demand.
The rise of the far-right Sweden Democrats, shunned by both center-right and center-left, left the big mainstream blocs neck-and-neck, and short of a majority, in Sunday's election.
""It is natural that the Alliance builds a government after this election result,"" said Ulf Kristersson, leader of the Moderate Party and the center-right's candidate for the premiership. ""We want the government to respect the result and resign,"" he told a news conference.
Without support from the center-left - or the Sweden Democrats - the Alliance of the Moderates, Centre Party, Liberals and Christian Democrats cannot take power.
""The Alliance is not going to negotiate with the Sweden Democrats,"" Centre Party leader Annie Loof said.
The Social Democrats have dominated Swedish politics for 100 years and Lofven said he would not facilitate an Alliance government by offering it support. ""You can discount that idea absolutely,"" he told a news conference later.
Preliminary election results, likely to be updated on Wednesday, show the center-left with 40.6 percent against 40.3 percent for the Alliance.
That would give the Social Democrats and Greens, together with the Left Party which supports Lofven in parliament, 144 of the Riksdag's 349 seats, two more than the Alliance.
The Sweden Democrats, who polled 17.6 percent, have 63 seats, meaning they could give either side a majority.
Overseas and postal votes are still being counted and could change the picture. Lofven said that if the recount lifted the center-right above his bloc, the Social Democrats would go into opposition.
""VICTORY OR DEATH"" 
All the mainstream parties have ruled out negotiating with the Sweden Democrats, founded in part by activists with white supremacist and neo-Nazi links, and so far there has been no sign of compromise on any side.
Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie Akesson, who has tried to weed out overt racism and tone down some of the party's rhetoric to broaden its appeal, has pledged to bring down any government that does not give it influence over policy, particularly on immigration.
In the days since the election, the Sweden Democrats have appeared resolved to follow through on their ultimatum. 
""Our enemies have really forced us into an life and death struggle for our culture and our nation's survival,"" party whip Mattias Karlsson wrote on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. ""There are only two choices: victory or death.""
Thrashing out a government that can pass a budget could take weeks or months, failing which a new election - which may still not produce a majority for either side - would be necessary.
Lofven is head of the biggest party and the biggest bloc. But the Alliance argues that it has the best chance of forming a viable coalition as the center-left bloc includes the Left Party, which would almost certainly be excluded from any future administration.
One side or the other will have to compromise or accept a role for the Sweden Democrats, who want to freeze immigration and call a referendum on Sweden's European Union membership. 
The cost of either choice would probably be high.
Splitting the Alliance would be likely to consign the center-right to years in opposition or as minority players in Social Democrat-dominated governments.

Some 700,000 Rohingya refugees crossed from the west of mostly Buddhist Myanmar into Bangladesh from August last year, according to U.N. agencies, when Rohingya insurgent attacks on Myanmar security forces triggered a sweeping military response.
Bangladesh and Myanmar reached a deal in November to begin repatriation within two months, but it has not started, with stateless Rohingya still crossing the border. 
""We are not thinking of assimilating them in Bangladesh. They belong to Myanmar,"" Foreign Secretary Shahidul Haque told Reuters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on ASEAN in Hanoi.
He also called on developed countries to take in more Rohingya on a humanitarian basis.
The Rohingya would stay in refugee camps until they return to Myanmar or are resettled in other countries, Haque said.
U.N. investigators last month said Myanmar's military carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Rohingya with ""genocidal intent"", and that the commander-in-chief and five generals should be prosecuted for the gravest crimes under international law.
Myanmar has denied allegations of atrocities, saying its military carried out justifiable actions against militants. 
It has built transit centers for refugees to return, but U.N. aid agencies say it is not yet safe for them to do so.
The Rohingya in Bangladesh are housed in camps in Cox's Bazar. With a delay in the repatriation plan, Bangladesh has been preparing new homes on a remote island called Bhasan Char, which rights groups have said could be subject to flooding.
Haque told Reuters the island could be ready within months for the Rohingya to move in, adding that the plan to house the Rohingya there was only temporary.
Bangladesh's prime minister this month urged the global community to increase pressure on Myanmar to ensure the repatriation of the Rohingya.

Most of the casualties were a group of Iraqi tourists traveling on board of a bus that stopped by the restaurant, police and medical source said.
No group has claimed responsibility, but Islamic State militants often carry out such attacks.
Iraqi security officials have said Islamic State is likely to wage an insurgency in Iraq after its self-proclaimed caliphate all but collapsed and the militants were dislodged from large areas of the west and north of the country.

YANGON (Reuters) - An organization founded by one of Myanmar's most famous political prisoners and an old ally of Aung San Suu Kyi, called on Wednesday for the release of two Reuters journalists jailed after being found guilty of violating an official secrets law.
A court found the two Reuters reporters - Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28 - guilty on Monday last week and jailed them for seven years in a landmark case seen as a test of progress toward democracy in the Southeast Asian country.
""If Hanthawady U Win Tin was still alive, he would ask for their release. On behalf of him, this foundation stands with them and ask for their release,"" said Kyaw Aung, the secretary of the foundation.
Journalist Win Tin was one of Myanmar's longest-serving political prisoners during military rule. He was a founding member of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), which campaigned for democracy for years.
Win Tin, who died 2014 at the age of 84, spent nearly two decades in Insein prison on the outskirts of Yangon, where the two Reuters reporters have been held since they were arrested in December, and where Suu Kyi was also briefly held.
The foundation, based in the city of Yangon, was established seven years ago and has been supporting political prisoners and their families. 
It is run by Win Tin's former colleagues and counts among its patrons Tin Oo, one of the senior-most figures in the movement against military rule and a senior NLD member. 
Suu Kyi, who is now government leader, has made no public comment on the reporters since they were convicted. The government spokesman said last week the court that convicted them under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act was independent and followed due process.

The two reporters, who pleaded not guilty, were investigating the killing of 10 villagers from the Muslim Rohingya minority, by the Myanmar security forces, at the time of their arrest.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo police have started using drones to catch drivers who do not respect traffic signs in an attempt to reduce the high number of casualties.
Since January the small Balkan country has introduced a new law that imposes heavy fines and police began patrolling with unmarked cars to remain unnoticed.
Two police officers launched a black and white drone just outside the capital Pristina where after few minutes they filmed a driver overtaking another car over a full white line on a bridge above the Pristina-Skopje highway.
The driver looked confused when a policeman approached with an iPad to show him the video from the drone.
A driver who commits such an offence must pay a fine of up to 300 euros, has his license confiscated for six months and loses two out of nine driving license points.
The average monthly gross salary in Kosovo is around 500 euros.
""This unit (with drones) is identifying people who pass the full white line in locations where it is prohibited to overtake (another car) and also identifies those who pass through red traffic lights,"" said police sergeant Qerim Hetemi.
Hetemi said the newly introduced methods had helped cut the death toll on Kosovo's roads to 82 in the January-August period this year from 85 in the same period in 2017.
The number of people injured on the roads in January-August this year stood at 8,312, down slightly from the previous year, in a country with a total population of 1.8 million.
The most deadly months are July and August, when many people living abroad, mainly in EU member states, return to Kosovo for holidays.
Careless driving, old cars and bad road signs are seen as the main reasons for high number of accidents.

LONDON (Reuters) - About 50 Brexit-supporting lawmakers in British Prime Minister Theresa May's party have met to discuss how and when they could force her out of her job, the BBC reported on Wednesday.
Since her botched bet on a snap election in June 2017 lost her party its majority in parliament, May has faced persistent talk of a leadership challenge which has weakened her as she tries to clinch a Brexit deal with the European Union.
Lawmakers from the European Research Group (ERG), a grouping in May's Conservative Party which wants a sharper break with the EU, met on Tuesday night and openly discussed May's future. Unattributed comments included ""everyone I know says she has to go"", ""she's a disaster"" and ""this can't go on,"" the BBC reported.
One source quoted by the BBC said ""people feel the leadership is out of touch and has lost the plot"" but another said changing the leader ""is a stupid idea now"".
A spokesman for May declined to comment on the report.
Publicly, the leading party skeptics pledged their loyalty.
When asked if May should go, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the ERG leader, told reporters: ""The policy needs to be changed but I am supporting the person. Theresa May has enormous virtues, she is a fantastically dutiful prime minister and she has my support - I just want her to change one item of policy.""
Former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who quit the cabinet in July over May's EU withdrawal plan, said: ""I disagree with her on one issue -- and it's this issue -- and she should stay in place because we need stability and we need decent government.""
The pound fell against the dollar to as low as $1.2994 but later recovered to trade flat at $1.3028.
The United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29. The EU and Britain hope to clinch a deal later this year so parliaments on both sides can ratify it before Brexit.
European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU will not allow Britain to participate only in some parts of the bloc's single market after Brexit without honoring all of the rules.
May's proposal for a post-Brexit free trade area with the EU for goods, which would include accepting a ""common rulebook"" for those goods, have angered committed Brexiteers inside her party.
Even a small rebellion inside her party on a final deal could spell the end of her minority government and throw Britain's exit into chaos.
OPEN REBELLION
Michael Gove, May's environment minister and a leading Brexiteer, told BBC radio: ""I want to ensure that we get a solid vote, which I’m sure we will, when the prime minister brings back the treaty,"" adding lawmakers should rally behind May.
Gove is one of the most visible Brexit campaigners still in the cabinet after Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Davis quit in July saying May's plan would keep too much EU influence. The rift deepened this week with Johnson comparing May's plan to a ""suicide vest"" on Britain's constitution.
Some rebel lawmakers at the Tuesday meeting said they had submitted letters of no confidence in May, the source told the BBC. Under Conservative rules, a leadership election is triggered if 15 percent of Conservative lawmakers, currently 48 of its 315 members of parliament (MPs), demand a vote of no confidence.
The ERG on Wednesday unveiled its proposal for how Britain could leave the EU without constructing a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, one of the main sticking points in securing a Brexit deal.
The BBC said Tuesday's meeting did not include all the ERG's senior figures and it had discussed possible scenarios depending on whether May was able to secure a deal with the EU based on her proposals.
May's spokesman said her proposal, known as ""Chequers"" for the country house where it was hashed out in July, is the only serious, credible and negotiable plan available.

The Sun newspaper reported on Wednesday that May's office was drawing up secret plans to ditch her Chequers blueprint if EU leaders reject it at a summit next week.

Max Zirngast, a political science student in his late 20s who writes for online publication Re:volt, has been held since Tuesday morning. Re:volt has said it believes the allegation against him is membership of a terrorist organization and that any such charge would be false.
""We expect Turkey to immediately explain what the journalist is accused of, and if that is not possible then to immediately release him,"" Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz told reporters before a weekly cabinet meeting.
Kurz's government, a coalition of his conservatives and the anti-immigration Freedom Party, is opposed to Turkey joining the European Union and has called for accession talks to be broken off. However, both countries have recently tried to improve their relations.
Part of the reason for Austria's hard line has been Ankara's crackdown following a failed coup attempt in July 2016 that Turkey says was orchestrated by a U.S.-based cleric who was once a close ally of President Tayyip Erdogan.
Turkey has detained around 160,000 people, including many journalists, and dismissed nearly the same number of civil servants since the putsch attempt, the U.N. human rights office said in March. Of that number, more than 50,000 have been formally charged and kept in jail during their trials.

The Dutch cybersecurity expert has been missing since Aug. 20, when he left his hotel in the northern Norwegian town of Bodoe, where he had been on holiday. The belongings were found by a man out fishing on Tuesday in an area to the east of Bodoe. 
""Due to the ongoing investigation the police do not at this time wish to release any information about which specific items that have been found,"" police said in a statement on Wednesday. 
Police have previously said they have no main theory about his disappearance, and there was no indication as to whether Kamphuis was the victim of a criminal act.
WikiLeaks was launched in 2006 as a web-based outlet for would-be leakers. In July 2010, it released more than 90,000 classified U.S. military documents on the war in Afghanistan and before publishing 400,000 more secret U.S. files on the Iraq war. The two leaks represented the largest security breaches of their kind in U.S. military history.
It followed these up with the release of 250,000 secret diplomatic cables from U.S. embassies around the world, angering U.S. politicians and military officials, who said the unauthorized dissemination would put lives at risk.
The discovery of Kamphuis' belongings was being investigated and the police are asking the public for any information about his movements in the area.
Investigators searched the area with assistance from local Red Cross and a rescue vessel.

Consob head Mario Nava was appointed earlier this year by the previous government.
""Nava, as an employee of a supra-national institution, is incompatible with the presidency of an independent Italian authority,"" the League party and the 5-Star Movement parliamentary group heads said in a statement.
Nava, 52, was the European Commission's director for financial system surveillance and crisis management until he was appointed to head Consob, prompting him to take a temporary leave, or secondment, from the Commission.
Lawmakers from both the 5-Star and the League, who took power in June, have criticized Nava because he did not resign from the EU institution and still benefits from judicial immunity.
The row escalated in August when Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Consob had not provided additional information requested by the government about Nava's status. However, people close to the matter in Rome said that the information had been turned over.
Nava's appointment passed the scrutiny of the President Sergio Mattarella and the country's audit court.

STRASBOURG (Reuters) - The European Union must flex its muscles as a world power, EU chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker said on Wednesday, as he spoke critically of U.S. President Donald Trump's retreat from international engagement.
In his annual State of the Union address to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Juncker, who is entering his final year as president of the European Commission, urged EU states to rein in angry divisions over budgets, immigration and other issues in order to capitalize on a chance to shape the world.
""Whenever Europe speaks as one, we can impose our position on others,"" Juncker said, arguing that a deal he struck in July with Trump to stall a transatlantic tariff war and which won plaudits for the Commission should have come as no surprise.
""The geopolitical situation makes this Europe's hour: the time for European sovereignty has come,"" he said.
Juncker made no direct comment on Trump or U.S. policy but aides said the geopolitical situation he spoke of was a U.S. retreat into what Juncker described elsewhere in the speech as ""selfish unilateralism"". He also saw new opportunities to work with China, Japan and others to develop ""multilateral"" rules.
Some proposals to strengthen the EU's effectiveness face an uphill battle against member state opposition, notably scrapping national vetoes in some foreign policy areas, such as where economic pressure from the likes of Russia or China on certain EU countries has blocked EU sanctions to defend human rights.
In repeating his support for deeper economic integration, he also pushed the idea that the euro should challenge the dollar as the world's leading currency, calling it ""absurd"" that the EU pays for most of its energy in the U.S. currency despite buying it mainly from the likes of Russia and the Gulf states. He said airlines should also buy planes priced in euros not dollars.
Juncker renewed calls for states to push ahead in developing an EU defense capability independent of the U.S.-led NATO alliance and to embrace Africa through investment and a sweeping new free trade area -- part of a strategy to curb the flow of poor African migrants which has set EU governments at each other's throats and fueled a sharp rise in anti-EU nationalism.
EU DIVISIONS
Without naming Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban -- whose government faced an unprecedented vote later on Wednesday to launch suspension proceedings from the EU -- Juncker blasted EU leaders who sought to undermine democracy and the rule of law and rejected complaints from lawmakers that the Commission has been lenient toward Hungary, Poland and other eastern states.
At the same time, the Commission put forward a plan to get even tougher on illegal economic migrants whose arrival has so angered Orban and others. 
However, the idea of a fully federal European Border and Coast Guard, with its own 10,000-strong uniformed force run from Brussels may hit national resistance.
With an eye on elections next May to the European Parliament, Juncker proposed new vigilance, and penalties, for attempts to manipulate voters. As the centenary nears of the end of World War One, he recalled how Europeans were taken totally by surprise by its outbreak and urged more respect for the EU as a force for peace against nationalistic ""poison and deceit"".
He spoke of regret at Britain's impending withdrawal from the bloc which will mark his five-year mandate and warned Prime Minister Theresa May that the EU would not compromise its single market to let London pick and choose which rules to obey.
But as negotiators struggle to overcome problems about the future of the land border on the island of Ireland, Juncker also pledged that Britain would remain a very close partner.

In the parliamentary debate which followed his hour-long address, Nigel Farage, of the UK Independence Party, accused him of failing to acknowledge the arrival of eurosceptics in government in Italy and of a ""populist revolt"" across Europe that would resist Juncker's aim to centralize more power.

VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin turned to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on a conference stage on Wednesday and offered to sign a peace treaty by the end of this year to formally end World War Two hostilities between their countries.
But soon after Putin made the dramatic offer, a Japanese government spokesman in Tokyo said Japan wants the return of islands in the Pacific captured by Russian troops in the last days of the war before it signs a peace treaty.
Russia and Japan have been in dispute for seven decades over the islands and as a result have still not formally ended their World War Two hostilities. The standoff has held back economic ties between the two near-neighbors.
""An idea has just come into my head,"" Putin said to Abe during a question and answer session at an economic forum in the Russian city of Vladivostok.
""Let's conclude a peace treaty before the end of this year, without any pre-conditions."" 
Abe did not respond.
Later in the same session, Putin said of his offer: ""I was not joking."" He said his idea was that the two sides sign a treaty first, and then work through the issues on which they are in dispute afterwards.
Both Moscow and Tokyo claim sovereignty over the islands, known in Russia as the Kurile islands and in Japan as the Northern Territories.
WORLD WAR LEGACY
At a regular briefing in Tokyo for reporters after Putin had made the offer, Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said: ""I don't want to comment on what President Putin said....However, our position that the Northern Territories issue is resolved before any peace treaty remains unchanged."" 
Both Abe and Putin say they want a solution to the dispute. The Japanese leader has said a deal would unlock trade and investment from Japanese companies for Russia, which is isolated from Western investment because of sanctions.
But for Putin, who casts himself publicly as a fierce champion of Russia's national interests, giving up the islands would risk a political backlash at home.
Earlier, Putin said security in the region was a key issue and that Russia was concerned by a move to establish a U.S. missile defense system there. 
Japan decided last year it would expand its ballistic missile defense system with U.S.-made ground-based Aegis radar stations and interceptors.
""This is all the subject of negotiations... We have been negotiating for 70 years,"" Putin said. 

""Shinzo said let's change approaches. Okay,"" Putin said, before proposing they sign a peace treaty.

1364,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 06:22AM ET</span>",Special Report: Slamming the door - How Trump transformed U.S. refugee program,"By Yeganeh Torbati and Omar Mohammed
WASHINGTON/KAKUMA, KENYA (Reuters) - On Jan. 19, 2017, Aden Hassan’s long wait to start a new life ended when he stepped off a plane in Columbus, Ohio, half a world away from the Kenyan refugee camp where he had lived for a decade.
Years earlier in Mogadishu, Somalia, Hassan’s father, a community organizer, was shot dead by the Islamist militants he opposed. A few years later, a younger brother and sister were killed by gunmen while walking home from school. After Hassan's mother survived an assassination attempt, she fled with her surviving children to neighboring Kenya. 
The Midwestern winter chill could not dampen Hassan’s hope, as he left the airport with his wife, their two young children and his brother, that Ohio would provide a security and stability the family had not known in years. All that remained was for his mother, her second husband, and Hassan’s brother and sister to join them, which refugee officials assured him would happen soon.
""When we landed at the airport, we felt we could start a new life,"" said Hassan, now 27. ""We were very hopeful, very grateful.""
The next day, Donald J. Trump was sworn in as U.S. president. Nineteen months later, Hassan's mother, Fatuma Diriye, a diabetic with heart problems, and his other relatives remain in Kenya's Kakuma refugee camp. Although they were approved for resettlement in the United States at the same time Hassan was, their plans have been repeatedly delayed by the Trump administration's dismantling of longstanding U.S. refugee policy. The State Department declined to comment on Diriye's case.
GRAPHIC: How the U.S. refugee program has changed under Donald Trump - https://tmsnrt.rs/2x90Pxg
A week after his inauguration, Trump issued an executive order temporarily banning travel from several Muslim-majority countries and halting all refugee admissions. Since then, through procedural changes made largely out of public view, the administration has reshaped the U.S. refugee program, slashing overall admissions and all but halting entry for some of the world's most persecuted people, including Syrians, Iraqis, Iranians and Somalis. 
This year, with a record high 68.5 million forcibly displaced people worldwide, the United States is on track to take in about 22,000 refugees, a quarter the number admitted in 2016, the last year of Barack Obama's presidency, and the fewest in four decades.
In interviews with Reuters, more than 20 current and former U.S. officials described how the Trump administration has abandoned policies established over decades and embraced by Republican and Democratic administrations alike. The officials, most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity, say the administration has rejected internal findings that refugees could be admitted safely and with little expense. Two senior staff members who questioned the administration's policies were removed from their positions. 
The administration has instituted opaque and complicated new security vetting procedures that have bogged down admissions and eliminated many candidates for resettlement who would previously have been accepted, many of the officials said. It has extended the strictest kind of vetting to women as well as men from 11 countries, mostly in the Middle East and Africa. And it has reduced by nearly two-thirds the number of officials conducting refugee interviews, reassigning about 100 of 155 interviewers to handle asylum screenings for people already in the country, including those who crossed the border illegally. 
""They're just stuck,"" said Angie Plummer, executive director of Community Refugee and Immigration Services in Ohio, the group that welcomed Hassan and his family last year. ""It's blocking people who absolutely would have been here two years ago.""
The Trump administration says the changes were necessary.
""Security improvements in the refugee program made in recent years to mandate additional screening for refugee applicants undoubtedly makes Americans safer,"" said Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security.
In addition to far lower admissions overall, the type of refugee admitted has changed under Trump, a Reuters analysis of government data shows. The percentage who are Muslim is now a third what it was two years ago; the percentage who are Europeans has tripled. 
The shift has led to striking imbalances. Refugees admitted to the United States from the small European country of Moldova, for example, now outnumber those from Syria by three to one, although the number of Syrian refugees worldwide outnumbers the total population of Moldova. 
Somalis like Hassan and his family now have little chance of getting in. As of Sept. 10, 251 Somali refugees have been resettled in America this year, a 97 percent drop from the 8,300 admitted by this point in 2016. 
A PREDICTABLE PATH
When Hassan and his family started the refugee process, the path was grueling and lengthy, but largely straightforward.
Granted refugee status by the United Nations in 2008, Hassan and his family were assigned to the United States for resettlement in 2016. Family members were then interviewed by U.S. refugee officers to establish whether they faced a serious threat if they returned to Somalia.
They then had to undergo rigorous security checks put into place after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Because of his age, gender and country of origin, Hassan was subjected to extra vetting.
After Hassan's family all passed the checks, they were told they would be sent to Ohio in two groups, one traveling first and the second soon after. Trump's January travel ban disrupted that plan.
In addition to suspending travel from some majority-Muslim countries and all refugee admissions, the order capped the maximum number of refugees in 2017 at 50,000, less than half the number Obama had set a few months earlier. 
Courts eventually barred implementation of the order. The administration replaced it with a less comprehensive version in March of 2017, followed by additional temporary restrictions on some nationalities. Today, no country's refugees are under an official ban, but several nationalities are nevertheless almost entirely blocked.
Syrian refugees, for example, were singled out in the first executive order as ""detrimental"" to the nation's interests. In the 10 months since the ban lapsed, only 27 Syrian refugees have been resettled in the United States. By contrast, the United Nations counted 6.3 million Syrian refugees as of 2017, by far the single largest nationality of refugees.
Current and former U.S. officials say the new policies have been driven by a small core of top administration officials, including White House senior advisor Stephen Miller; Gene Hamilton, a former advisor at the Department of Homeland Security; and John Kelly, former secretary of Homeland Security and now White House chief of staff. 
Hamilton, now at the Department of Justice, declined to comment through a spokesman. The White House did not respond to requests for comment.
Provided with a detailed description of Reuters' reporting, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said that ""the administration is committed to a fair and responsible refugee policy that maximizes the reach and effectiveness of our global humanitarian assistance."" He added that ""America is now safer.""
The remaking of the refugee program began with a full examination of screening procedures, something called for in the travel ban. Conducted in the summer and fall of 2017, the review concluded that refugees from all countries could safely be allowed to enter with some tightening of vetting, according to seven current or former U.S. officials who helped formulate or were briefed on the findings.
White House staff, including Miller and Kelly, were not happy with that conclusion, said one current and two former officials. In particular, the White House wanted to continue barring refugees from Somalia, Hassan's home country, for reasons that were unclear, the two former officials and a second current official said. That posed a problem: The working group had found no evidence that Somali refugees presented a unique threat.
Homeland Security officials proposed that when admissions were resumed, the government would conduct a further 90-day review of refugees from 11 countries, including Somalia. During that time, refugees from the countries would remain effectively blocked.
Some members of the working group felt the additional review - which directly affected thousands of refugees - was unnecessary, designed solely to satisfy White House officials.
Waldman, the Homeland Security spokeswoman, disputed that assessment. ""The further 90-day review was proposed for absolutely no other reason than to ensure a risk-based approach to the security enhancements,"" she said. 
The 11 countries - Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, North Korea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - had been identified as potential threats as far back as the early 2000s, and their refugees had long been subject to more rigorous screening. But previous administrations still admitted refugees from those countries. Between 2002 and 2016, they accounted for 36 percent of U.S. refugees.
Since the end of the 90-day review, when admissions of refugees from the 11 nations were supposed to continue with additional screening, refugees from the countries have made up fewer than two percent of admissions.
Through Sept. 10, 564 refugees from the countries have been admitted since the start of the fiscal year in October, a 98 percent decrease over the same period in 2016, when nearly 34,000 refugees from the 11 countries came to America.
Fatuma Diriye, who cannot read or write, does not follow the details of U.S. policymaking. Her son, who does, realized the new procedures posed huge obstacles for his mother. 
""I lost a lot of hope that I had before,"" he said.
BACKLOG
Diriye had cleared all the security screening required in 2016, but now she must undergo an additional advanced check known as a Security Advisory Opinion. That type of vetting previously was required just for men from the 11 targeted countries. 
The online portal that tracks Diriye's case now says her security status is ""in process,"" but she doesn't know what that means. When the refugee group assisting the family inquired about Diriye's status last month, they were told only that her case is ""on hold pending further review.""
One primary source of the long delays, five current or former officials told Reuters, is the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which shares responsibility with other intelligence agencies for Security Advisory Opinions, the extra background checks now required of most refugees from the 11 countries.  
In May, the State Department limited requests for the advanced checks to 500 per month globally, according to a State Department memo reviewed by Reuters.  The memo cited an increasing ""backlog"" as the reason for the limit, without mentioning the FBI.
The cap has effectively kept a large portion of refugees from the 11 countries from progressing beyond the first stages of the refugee process. 
Asked about its role in the vetting process, an FBI spokeswoman said the agency's ""primary focus is to protect the United States from national security and criminal threats.""
A State Department spokesman said improvements in the refugee vetting process have ""had a direct impact on how quickly security checks can be conducted."" 
'A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE MISSTEP'
Some Pentagon officials have expressed alarm to the White House and other agencies about how the new screening measures are affecting one category of refugees: Iraqis who helped the United States in battle.
These Pentagon officials say such admissions provide a lifeline to people who risked their lives assisting the United States. As of Sept. 7, just 48 Iraqi refugees with U.S. affiliations had been admitted this fiscal year, according to State Department data. More than 3,000 were admitted last year and about 5,100 in 2016.
During a White House meeting last month, FBI officials revealed that their screening had turned up suspicious information on 87 of 88 U.S.-affiliated Iraqis who recently underwent background checks, a far higher hit rate than in the past, according to two officials with knowledge of the meeting. But it is unclear even to people inside the government how the FBI's processes have changed, they said. The FBI spokeswoman declined to give information on vetting processes, saying only that the agency ""takes the necessary time to thoroughly review all the information available."" 
One Iraqi interpreter, who worked for the U.S. Army for years and was approved for refugee status, described the obstacles he has faced since Trump took office. His account, provided on condition of anonymity, was confirmed by records from a court case against the administration in which he is a plaintiff and by two U.S. veterans who worked with him.
After being targeted by militants opposed to the U.S. in Iraq, the man fled to Egypt in 2014 and applied for refugee status. In late 2016, he was accepted.
Trump's travel ban delayed his plans. He persisted, however, filing additional paperwork and undergoing new medical exams, and last September was again cleared for travel. Then came the 90-day review of Iraqis and others from the 11 countries. When that lifted, the interpreter said, he was asked to provide information for additional vetting, including 10 years' worth of travel history, residential addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and information about his wife, children and brother - a daunting challenge, he said, given the turmoil in Iraq.
""I can't tell you how exhausting it was,"" he told Reuters. ""In Iraq, for a period of time, it was hard to keep a phone number.""
Months after submitting the information, he is still in limbo and fears being deported by Egypt. 
Not admitting the interpreter is “just a horrible, horrible misstep for national security,” said Chris Brusznicki, a U.S. Army veteran who worked with him in Iraq. People like him, Brusznicki said, “keep Americans from coming home in coffins.”
SIDELINED
Each September, the president must determine the maximum number of refugees the United States will admit during the next fiscal year. Last year, Trump set the cap at 45,000, the lowest since the modern refugee program was established in 1980. State Department data suggests it is unlikely actual admissions will reach half that number, if they continue at the current rate. 
With October a few weeks away, the administration now must decide next year’s ceiling. In early meetings, the Pentagon and State Department have supported maintaining a cap of 45,000, one current and one former official said. Refugee advocates fear it will be set lower.
In part, that is because two advocates for the refugee program will not participate in the discussions this year: Jennifer Arangio, until July a senior staffer at the National Security Council, and Lawrence Bartlett, a career State Department official who has served in Republican and Democratic administrations. 
Arangio worked on Trump’s election campaign, but on refugees she found herself in opposition to Miller, Hamilton and their allies, three people who worked with her said, because she supported a higher cap than they wanted.
She was turned down for positions she hoped to get at the State Department, including in the bureau that handles refugees, said two people familiar with her departure. In July, she was fired from her NSC job. Arangio declined to comment.
Bartlett was removed as director of U.S. refugee admissions late last year. He is now posted to Turkey, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile.
Both Bartlett and the State Department declined to comment on his removal. Sarah Breen, a spokeswoman for the agency’s Inspector General, said her office is “conducting a review of allegations of political retaliation against Department of State employees.” 
Hassan and his family are learning to navigate their new life. They live in a modest apartment furnished with donations. He has gotten a driver's license and a job on the overnight shift at an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse, and his English is improving. Last month, Hassan’s wife gave birth to their third child, a girl. They take the older children to a nearby park to ride bicycles.
But he worries about his family in Kenya. Diriye, her husband and Hassan’s 10-year-old brother and 14-year-old sister remain in a two-room shelter at the Kakuma camp, home to nearly 150,000 refugees. Their home has no running water or electricity. They survive on U.N.-supplied rations and whatever money Hassan can send each month. 
Diriye does not know when or if she will meet her new granddaughter. Recently, the online portal tracking her case had additional information: Her required medical exam was no longer current and needed to be repeated, but she must wait to be contacted about a new appointment.

""Please be patient,"" it says.

General Assembly: media,"YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar government leader Aung San Suu Kyi will not attend the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week, media reported on Wednesday, amid growing calls for Myanmar's security forces to be held accountable for alleged crimes against Rohingya Muslims.
Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi heads the civilian government in the specially created role of state counsellor, but also serves as minister of foreign affairs.
She would not attend the upcoming General Assembly session, the 7Day Daily, a leading newspaper, reported, citing a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official. 
Instead, two senior ministers in her government, Kyaw Tint Swe and Kyaw Tin - both seasoned diplomats who in the past defended Myanmar's former military regime on the global stage - would attend and ""explain current developments on repatriation and cooperation with international organizations"", the official, permanent secretary Myint Thu, was paraphrased as saying.
Reuters' calls to Myint Thu were not answered on Monday. Government spokesman Zaw Htay declined to comment.
Suu Kyi has curtailed her overseas travel as calls for accountability have grown since some 700,000 Rohingya fled the country last year, according to U.N. agencies, as security forces launched a brutal response to insurgent attacks in August. 
She also skipped the assembly a year ago, just after the violence flared, after she had been expected to attend.
Her administration has largely denied allegations of abuses during the operation and has pledged to accept back those who fled.
But international pressure has continued to mount on Myanmar, and the Rohingya crisis is expected to be a major theme of discussions at the General Assembly.
An independent U.N. team of investigators said last month that there was evidence indicating ""genocidal intent"" by the military. 
The International Criminal Court has said it can investigate the alleged deportation of Rohingya from Myanmar to Bangladesh. Myanmar says the ICC has no jurisdiction as it is not a member of the court, but the court ruled it can rule on acts that partly took place in Bangladesh, a member state.

U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet on Monday backed calls for a new body to be formed to begin working, in addition to a possible ICC probe, to gather evidence for future prosecutions over alleged crimes against the Rohingya.

French President Emmanuel Macron hosted a conference in May where rival Libyan factions agreed to work with the United Nations for a national election by December 10.
Libya splintered following the 2011 NATO-backed revolt that toppled Muammar Gaddafi, and since 2014 has been divided between competing political and military groups based in Tripoli and the east.
""You can not vote with instability in the streets ... it is necessary that everyone accepts the result of the ballot. We need shared rules,"" Seraj, who leads the U.N.-brokered transitional government based in Tripoli, said in an interview with Italian daily Corriere della Sera.
Armed groups have vowed to resume hostilities if talks to be hosted by U.N. Special Envoy Ghassan Salame (how are these talks related to the vote?) ===They are note related. Problem is that if hostilities are resumed===, do not result in a lasting settlement.
Seraj has close relations with Italy.
His main rival, military commander Khalifa Haftar, is aligned with a government based in the east and is seen as closer to France.
Seraj also said factions would need to agree on a constitution before any vote is held. 
""We had talked about elections in Paris, but the constitutional document, which is ready but not approved, must first voted on (voted on? translation?),"" Seraj said.

""Unfortunately, the parliament of Tobruk has not yet examined it. Without the constitution, how can one go to a national vote?"".

The conservative leader said Germany's could not just reject military intervention, a direct rebuke of her Social Democratic coalition partners, who have rejected participation in military action against Syria.
""It cannot be the German position to simply say 'no', no matter what happens in the world,"" she told the Bundestag lower house of parliament.
Germany, the world's fourth largest economy, is under pressure from the United States to boost military spending and shoulder more responsibility within NATO. It did not participate in military strikes carried out by U.S., French and British forces on Syria in April after a chemical weapons attack. 
But Merkel and her conservatives must win over the more pacifist Social Democrats (SPD), junior partners in the ruling coalition, and overcome massive public opposition to Germany's participation in military combat missions.
SPD leader Andrea Nahles on Wednesday told lawmakers her party would not agree to military intervention in Syria unless the United Nations authorized such action.
Combat missions remain a sensitive topic in Germany, given its Nazi past. Participation in any air strikes in Syria would also put Germany on a collision course with Russia, the main backer of President Bashar al-Assad. 

Seventy-four percent of Germans oppose participation in a military intervention in the event of another chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government, according to a new poll by Die Welt newspaper that was published Wednesday.

PARIS (Reuters) - The former bodyguard whose violent conduct plunged French President Emmanuel Macron into his biggest political crisis this summer agreed reluctantly to face questioning by senators as their hearings resumed on Wednesday.
Alexandre Benalla, 26, is under criminal investigation after being filmed beating a May Day protester. The scandal brought the sharpest criticism Macron has faced since taking power 16 months ago, prompting the president to fire Benalla, his closest bodyguard, and shake up his office.
The prospect of Benalla's public grilling on Sept. 19 will keep the saga in the public eye just as Macron tries to inject new life into his presidency amid a slump in popularity and economic headwinds.
Benalla had feared placing himself in legal jeopardy and only agreed to testify before the upper house's investigating committee late on Tuesday after being told that he risked two years in prison and a 7,500 euro ($8,700) fine if he refused.
""To avoid the legal risks I am threatened with, I am forced to appear before this committee,"" Benalla said in a statement.
The scandal, which was dismissed by Macron as a ""storm in a teacup"", has reinforced the perception among many French people of a haughty president and undermined his claim of building an ""exemplary Republic"".
A poll published by Odoxa on Tuesday had Macron's popularity sinking 12 points between June and September, to a record low of 29 percent for his presidency. Its findings echo other surveys.
Senators from the opposition-controlled chamber resumed quizzing senior officials in Macron's office on Wednesday. 

The lower house's own investigation, controlled by Macron's party, was disbanded in August after opposition MPs objected to its chairwoman's decision not to interview Macron's chief of staff.

Protests of right-wing radicals in the eastern city of Chemnitz two weeks ago after the fatal stabbing of a German blamed on two migrants has reignited a fierce debate about her 2015 decision to let more than a million refugees into Germany.
""There is no excuse or reason for hunting people down, using violence and Nazi slogans, showing hostility to people who look different, who have a Jewish restaurant, for attacks on police officers,"" Merkel told the Bundestag lower house of parliament.

He accused Merkel of spreading fake news about the demonstrations and supported Hans-Georg Maassen, head of the BfV intelligence agency who is under fire for questioning whether video footage showing gangs hounding migrants were real. 

""The truth is, there was no hunting down of people in Chemnitz... The citizens who demonstrated were criminalized,"" said Gauland.

1371,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>",Polls suggest far-right to gain ground in 2019 EU vote,"By Daphne Psaledakis and Alastair Macdonald
BRUSSELS/STRASBOURG (Reuters) - Sweden's far-right, anti-immigration party will double its seats in the European Union parliament next May if it matches the 17.6 percent it scored in a national vote on Sunday that came as a jolt to Europe from historically liberal Scandinavia.
With four of Sweden's 21 seats in the 705-member chamber, the Sweden Democrats' voice would be small. But it will find an echo from many other parts of the European Union, as a Reuters analysis of recent national ballots and opinion polls suggests a euroskeptic bloc may grow by some 60 percent in the Parliament.
That would leave those who are hostile to deeper EU integration with around a fifth of the legislature, not enough to push any big changes but enough to challenge the established parties and crack open internal divisions soon after Britain leaves the bloc next March.
The Reuters analysis is based on the latest available polls by reputable agencies in the EU’s 27 remaining states, or actual national election results in those countries which have held an election more recently than the last poll. Most of the polls ask people how they would vote in a hypothetical national election. Most countries use proportional representation in EU elections, making translating vote share into seats relatively simple. Voting by regions in Italy and Ireland where opinion polls offer only national data complicates that process and so the seat count analysis makes some further assumptions. 
While aggregating different polls is non-scientific and provides little more than a snapshot, it is a method used by some EU officials internally - including at the EU assembly itself - to get a sense of the shape of the next parliament.
The latest data indicate a clear strengthening for movements beyond the mainstream at a time in which Steve Bannon, an architect of President Donald Trump's election win in the United States, has launched a project to push the anti-EU vote across the Union.
The current popularity of the anti-establishment parties in Italy's new coalition, 5-Star and The League, boosts the possibility their current blocs in Brussels will increase in strength. Their ratings, and the rise of Alternative for Germany, more than offset the loss to the anti-EU camp of the UK Independence Party, whose 19 members will leave along with Britain, leaving a smaller chamber.
Polls suggest the EFDD grouping, dominated today by UKIP and 5-Star, could grow to 58 from 45 seats if alignments are unchanged. The ENF grouping, which includes Marine Le Pen's French National Rally and Geert Wilders' Dutch Freedom Party, could nearly double to 62 seats from 35, thanks in part to the surge in popularity of The League in Italy.
That would take the two right-wing groupings’ combined total to 119 seats from 78 and their share to 16.9 percent from 10.4 percent, as the total number of seats falls to 705 from 751. 
SHIFTING ALLIANCES
That analysis assumes the eight transnational party groupings in the current chamber will stay the same. In reality, new alignments in the next EU legislature will depend heavily on horse-trading and switching loyalties. Italy's 5-Star has previously explored joining the pro-EU centrists in Brussels. 
Other parties could shift to more overtly euroskeptic positions. These might include members of the ECR, set up by Britain's ruling Conservatives as a euroskeptic alternative to the main center-right EPP and which will now lose British seats. 
Poland's ruling Law and Justice Party could seek a new home outside the ECR. But like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban whose Fidesz party is a controversial member of the EPP, they do not share some hardliners' goal of breaking up the EU altogether – not least because Brussels gives them substantial subsidies.
Elsewhere on the political spectrum, the collapse in elections last year of the traditional left and right in France suggests a potential boost for the European Parliament's centrist bloc ALDE – should President Emmanuel Macron's new movement aligns with it -- and for the somewhat loose alliance on the far left known in Brussels as GUE.
The polling analysis suggests the EPP, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats, would remain the biggest group. It would shrink to 186 seats from 219 in the smaller chamber but hold its lead over the center-left S&D.

Discussions have gained momentum within the U.S. government over possible economic penalties in response to reports of mass detentions of ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in the far western region, which have prompted a growing international outcry.
Any sanctions decision would be a rare move on human rights grounds by U.S. President Donald Trump against China, with which he has engaged in a trade war while also seeking Beijing's help to resolve a standoff over North Korea's nuclear weapons.
The U.S. State Department said it had received a letter from a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers at the end of August asking Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to impose sanctions on a number of Chinese officials accused of overseeing the policies in Xinjiang.
Those included Chen Quanguo, Communist Party chief in Xinjiang and also a member of the politburo, one of the party's top decision making bodies.
""China consistently resolutely opposes the United States using Xinjiang-related issues to interfere in China's internal affairs,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a daily news briefing.
""If the media report is correct, we urge the relevant side to respect the facts, abandon prejudice, and stop doing and saying things that harm Sino-U.S. mutual trust and cooperation,"" Geng said, referring to news reports on the U.S. deliberations.
Geng added that all people in China ""fully enjoy freedom of religion in accordance with the law"".
Beijing has said Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tension between the Uighur minority who call the region home and members of the ethnic Han Chinese majority.
Chen made his mark swiftly after taking the top post in Xinjiang in 2016, with mass ""anti-terror"" rallies conducted in the region's largest cities involving tens of thousands of paramilitary troops and police.
One of his most visible initiatives has been to build thousands of grid-style police checkpoints across Xinjiang, and human rights advocates have decried martial law conditions and mass DNA collection. 
Last month, a U.N. rights panel said it had received credible reports that up to one million ethnic Uighurs may be held in extra-legal detention camps in Xinjiang, and called for them to be freed.
U.S. sanctions could be imposed under the Global Magnitsky Act, a federal law that allows the U.S. government to target human rights violators around the world with freezes on any U.S. assets, U.S. travel bans, and prohibitions on Americans doing business with them.
Widely read Chinese state-run tabloid the Global Times wrote in a Wednesday editorial that foreign forces were trying to ""prise apart"" China using religion as an excuse.

""It's fortunate that China is so strong that those forces foolishly clamouring can only add a bit of pressure from public opinion, but their dream of long-arm jurisdiction is in the end a mirage,"" the paper said.

""The Commission will resist all attacks on the rule of law,"" Juncker said in an annual state-of-the-union speech in the European Parliament in Strasbourg.
""We continue to be very concerned by the developments in some of our Member States. Article 7 must be applied whenever the rule of law is threatened,"" he said.

The European Parliament will vote later on Wednesday whether to start the same process against Hungary.
Juncker also stressed all rulings by the EU's highest court had to be respected, in an apparent reference to remarks by Poland's deputy prime minister Jaroslaw Gowin who said that, if the ruling on the government's changes to the judiciary was unfavorable to Warsaw, Poland could ignore it.

""We need to be very clear on one point: judgments from the Court of Justice must be respected and implemented. This is vital. The European Union is a community of law. Respecting the rule of law and abiding by Court decisions are not optional,"" Juncker said.

""The world owes it to those brave people standing up for human rights, who have responded to requests to provide information to and engage with the United Nations, to ensure their right to participate is respected,"" Guterres wrote.
""Punishing individuals for cooperating with the United Nations is a shameful practice that everyone must do more to stamp out.""

The new cases were in Bahrain, Cameroon, China, Colombia, Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Hungary, India, Israel, Kyrgyzstan, Maldives, Mali, Morocco, Myanmar, Philippines, Russian Federation, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, South Sudan, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. 
Governments frequently charged human rights activists with terrorism or blamed them for cooperating with foreign entities or damaging the state's reputation or security, it said.
“(There is a) disturbing trend in the use of national security arguments and counter-terrorism strategies by states as justification for blocking access by communities and civil society organisations to the United Nations,"" the report said.
Women cooperating with the U.N. had reported threats of rape and being subject to online smear campaigns, and U.N. staff often encountered people who were too afraid to speak to them, even at U.N. headquarters in New York and Geneva.
U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights Andrew Gilmour, who will present the report to the Human Rights Council next week, said in a statement that the cases in the report were the tip of the iceberg. 
""We are also increasingly seeing legal, political and administrative hurdles used to intimidate – and silence - civil society,” he said.

1376,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 04:31AM ET</span>","In quake-prone Japan, attention shifts to flood risks as heavy rains increase","By Kiyoshi Takenaka
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese have long been conditioned to prepare for earthquakes, but recent powerful typhoons and sudden, heavy rains have brought to the forefront another kind of disaster: flooding.
Experts warn that thousands could die and as many as 5 million people would need to be evacuated if massive dikes and levees in low-lying eastern Tokyo are overwhelmed by surging floodwaters.
The cities of Osaka and Nagoya also face flood risks, experts say, amid an increase in sudden heavy rainfall across the country in recent years, a symptom linked to global warming.
""Japan's major metropolitan areas are, in a way, in a state of national crisis,"" said Toshitaka Katada, a professor of disaster engineering at the University of Tokyo. 
In July, parts of western Japan were deluged with more than 1,000 millimeters (39 inches) of torrential rain. Gushing water broke levees and landslides destroyed houses, killing more than 200 people in the country's worst weather disaster in 36 years.
""If this happened to Tokyo, the city would suffer catastrophic damage,"" said Nobuyuki Tsuchiya, director of the Japan Riverfront Research Center and author of the book ""Capital Submerged,"" which urges steps to protect the city, which will host the 2020 Olympics and Rugby World Cup games next year.
Particularly vulnerable are the 1.5 million people who live below sea level in Tokyo, near the Arakawa River, which runs through the eastern part of the city. 
In June, the Japan Society of Civil Engineers estimated that massive flooding in the area would kill more than 2,000 people and cause 62 trillion yen ($550 billion) in damage.
Experts could not say how likely that scenario was. But in recent years, the government has bolstered the city's water defenses by building dams, reservoirs and levees. 
But the pace of construction is too slow, said Satoshi Fujii, a special adviser to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who is known for pushing big infrastructure projects.
""They need to be taken care of as soon as possible,"" he told Reuters.
John Coates, chairman of the International Olympic Committee's coordination commission for the Tokyo 2020 Games, said the city should ""take into account the potential for some of these disasters that seem to beset your country.""
In tacit acknowledgement that more needs to be done, the transport ministry late last month asked the finance ministry for 527 billion yen for levee reinforcement and evacuation preparation in next year's budget. That's a third more than the current year. 
SURROUNDED BY WATER
Tokyo was last hit by major flooding in 1947, when Typhoon Kathleen inundated large swaths of the city and killed more than 1,000 people across Japan.
A survivor from that disaster, 82-year-old Eikyu Nakagawa, recalled living on the roof of his one-story house with his father for three weeks, surrounded by water. He remembered a pregnant woman who had taken refuge in a two-story house next door. 
""The baby could come any minute, but we could not bring a midwife to her or take her to a doctor,"" he said. ""I was just a kid, but I lost sleep worrying that she might die.""
A similar disaster today would be much worse, Nakagawa predicted, because the area around his house in Tokyo's eastern Katsushika ward, once surrounded by rice paddies, is now packed with buildings. 
""It's going to be terrible,"" he said. ""Now it's so crowded with houses. Little can be done if water comes.""
Intense rainfall is on the upswing across Japan. Downpours of more than 80 millimeters in an hour happened 18 times a year on average over the 10 years through 2017, up from 11 times between 1976-85. 
Warming global temperatures contribute to these bouts of extreme weather, scientists say. 
""Higher ocean temperatures cause more moisture to get sucked up into the air,"" said University of Tokyo's Katada. ""That means a very large amount of rain falling at once, and typhoons are more likely to grow stronger.""
Just last week, western Japan was battered by Typhoon Jebi, the strongest typhoon to make landfall in 25 years, which killed at least 13 people and inundating the region's biggest international airport.
EVACUATION NIGHTMARE
In late August, five low-lying wards in Tokyo jointly unveiled hazard maps outlining areas at high risk of flooding, and warned that up to 2.5 million residents may need to evacuate in case of a major disaster.
The maps, which will be available to residents online and via hard copy, show how deep floodwater would likely be for each area, and how long each area would remain underwater.
But such maps were largely ignored during the deadly flooding in western Japan in July.
If a disaster hits during weekday working hours, the number of evacuees could swell to 5 million, including those from neighboring wards, says Tsuchiya - a logistical nightmare. Tokyo prefecture has grown to 14 million people, with millions more in surrounding areas.
Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has called for a new ministry that would focus on disaster prevention and recovery. Currently that is overseen by the Cabinet Office, which handles other disparate tasks such as laying out basic fiscal policy and nurturing technological innovation.
Companies also are waking up to the danger of floods, said Tomohisa Sashida, senior principal consultant at Tokio Marine & Nichido Risk Consulting. 

""We have been often approached for quake-related business continuity plans."" he said. ""But now they realize they need to keep flood risks in mind and flood-related consultations are certainly on the rise.""

The rare announcement of specific data on the nuclear program came days after Iran's nuclear chief said it had completed a facility to build advanced centrifuges - Tehran has said it will increase its capacity to enrich uranium if the nuclear pact collapses following Washington's withdrawal in May.
Under the terms of the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.
The deal allows the Islamic Republic to operate up to 5,060 first-generation centrifuges for 10 years at its Natanz plant and 1,044 first-generation centrifuges at its underground Fordow enrichment plant. 
Before the deal, Iran had 20,000 centrifuges installed at Natanz and Fordow, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
The remaining signatories to the deal - Russia, China, Germany France and Britain - are trying to salvage the accord.
""America and Israel have a program against Iran and they scrapped a deal they requested,"" Larijani said, according to Tasnim. 
""After America withdrew, European leaders asked that Iran not give a quick reply to this action and they asked for time, which is passing now,"" he added.

The remaining powers say the deal is the best hope of preventing Iran from developing a nuclear bomb. Iran says its atomic program is for electricity generation and other peaceful purposes.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A Singapore DJ has filed a court challenge against a colonial-era law that bans gay sex in the conservative city-state, his lawyers said on Wednesday, following India's scrapping of similar legislation.
Johnson Ong Ming, 43, also known as DJ Big Kid, filed his challenge with the High Court on Monday, his lawyers told Reuters, just four days after India's landmark ruling.
Under Section 377A of Singapore's Penal Code, a man found to have committed an act of ""gross indecency"" with another man could be jailed for up to two years, although prosecutions are rare. The law does not apply to homosexual acts between women.
""We intend to argue that Section 377A is absurd and arbitrary,"" lawyers Suang Wijaya and Eugene Thuraisingam told Reuters in a joint statement, adding that the law is ""in violation of human dignity"". 
Previous legal challenges to overturn the ban have failed, but a top Singapore diplomat called on the gay community to renew legal action against the law a day after India's top court decriminalized gay sex.
During its six decades since independence, Singapore has emerged as a modern, wealthy city state.
Yet, lawmakers remain typically cautious over social reforms, partly due to sensitivities stemming from the ethnic and religious mix among Singapore's 5.6 million inhabitants.
""An unusually large number of legal developments in various jurisdictions have occurred in a short span of time since (the last legal challenge in) October 2014,"" said the lawyers, who are acting for Ong on a probono basis, citing cases in the United States, Belize, Taiwan, Hong Kong and India. 
Last year, Taiwan's constitutional court declared that same-sex couples have the right to legally marry in the first such ruling in Asia.
Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam said last week that the issue was up to the Singapore society to decide but the majority of Singaporeans were opposed to any change to the law, adding that ""a growing minority want it to be repealed"".
A public opinion survey released this week showed a slim majority of Singaporeans still support the law with 55 percent of 750 Singaporeans polled in favor of it. 
The poll by independent market research and consulting firm Ipsos showed 12 percent opposed the law, while 33 percent of respondents were neither for nor against it.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has previously said that Singapore society ""is not that liberal on these matters"".

Washington and Pyongyang have been discussing North Korea's nuclear program since their leaders met in Singapore in June, though that summit's outcome was criticized for being short on details about how and whether North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was willing to give up weapons that threaten the United States. 
Putin, speaking at an economic forum in the Russian port city of Vladivostok, said Pyongyang had taken positive steps and was now waiting for a response. He said it was counter-productive if one side did a lot and the other did nothing.
""If North Korea does something toward denuclearization it expects reciprocal steps and not endless demands for full disarmament,"" said Putin.
Putin said it was also important that North Korea received international guarantees about its own security and said Kim Jong Un was welcome to visit Russia at any time that was convenient for him. 

The White House said on Monday that U.S. President Donald Trump had received a letter from Kim Jong Un asking for a second meeting.

Anwar, who just returned to public life after years of incarceration, has been named the ruling coalition's prime minister-in-waiting but needs a seat in parliament to legitimise his position should Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad step down for him in this term, as promised.
Anwar will contest the coastal seat of Port Dickson in the south-western state of Negri Sembilan, and his People's Justice Party (PKR) has pledged to pull all the stops to ensure his return to active politics and eventually lead the Pakatan Harapan, or Pact of Hope, government.
""We believe... he will strengthen Pakatan Harapan's position as an MP,"" PKR secretary-general Saifuddin Nasution said at a press conference to announce the move, aired live on local television.
Anwar was not present at the press conference as he was on a flight back from Hong Kong.
Anwar changed the face of Malaysian politics in the late 1990s, becoming the face of the Reformasi or reform movement after he was sent to jail during Mahathir's last tenure as premier over disputed charges of sodomy and corruption.
Anwar was previously Mahathir's deputy but the two leaders had a falling out during the 1997-1999 Asian financial crisis.
Anwar, was later freed in 2004, but jailed a second time for sodomy in 2015. Both times, he and his supporters said the charges were politically motivated.
Mahathir secured a royal pardon for Anwar after the May election, and promised to step aside for his friend-turned-foe-turned-ally to become prime minister.

Mahathir, 93, secured a stunning election win in May, ending the decade-long rule of former premier Najib Razak and changing Malaysia's government for the first time in six decades. 
But the Senate, or upper house of parliament, is still dominated by an opposition led by the defeated Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which can block bills and delay government initiatives.
Malaysia was among the first few countries to introduce an anti-fake news law although other countries in the region, including Singapore and the Philippines, have said they are considering how to tackle ""fake news"".
Critics accused Najib using the law to curb free speech ahead of the May general election as his government tried to fend off criticism over accusations of graft and mismanagement.
In August, the lower house of parliament voted out the Anti-Fake News 2018 bill, which set out fines of up to 500,000 ringgit ($123,000) and jail of up to six years for reporting ""wholly or partly false"" news.
But BN Senate leaders and members of the right-wing Islamist party, Parti Islam se-Malaysia on Wednesday blocked its repeal.
The bill will go back to the lower house of parliament for another vote. 
Co-opted by U.S. President Donald Trump, the term ""fake news"" has become part of the standard repertoire of leaders in authoritarian countries to describe media reports and organizations critical of them.
Just days ahead of the elections, Mahathir himself was accused of spreading fake news after authorities said they were investigating him over what they said were false claims that his plane was sabotaged.
Other leaders opposed to Najib were also charged under the act.

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistani authorities on Wednesday temporarily released former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter from prison to attend funeral services for his wife, Kulsoom, who died of cancer the day before in London.
Video footage from Geo TV showed Sharif walking through Islamabad's airport amid tight security to be flown to the eastern city of Lahore, near the family home. 
The former premier and his daughter have been given parole for 12 hours but the government of Punjab province is considering an extension so they can attend the funeral on Friday. The body is due to be flown back from London on Thursday.
""Initially, we released them on parole for 12 hours but the application they have given to the Punjab government is for five days and we are considering it,"" provincial law minister Muhammad Raja Basharat told Reuters.
Ousted as prime minister last year by the Supreme Court over some undeclared income, Nawaz Sharif was in London with Kulsoom this year when a separate anti-graft court handed him a 10-year jail term in absentia over the ownership of luxury flats in London in the 1990s.
Maryam Sharif, his daughter and presumed political heir, was sentenced to seven years in prison on related charges.
Both Sharifs said they had broken no law and there was no proof the residences were purchased with money from corruption.
The father and daughter left Kulsoom's bedside to return to Pakistan to rally their followers ahead of a July 25 general election. Both were arrested on arrival and have been imprisoned since.
Sharif's party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, which had been in power for five years, lost to the party of former cricket star Imran Khan.
Khan on Tuesday extended condolences to the Sharif family.
Three-time-premier Sharif, who was removed from office in each of his elected terms, has maintained that his most recent ousting in July 2017 and subsequent conviction were part of a plot against him by the military and the judiciary.

The army has repeatedly denied any interference in politics, while the courts insist justice is carried out impartially.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's center-right government will face a by-election in deposed prime minister Malcolm Turnbull's seat on Oct. 20 and could lose its parliamentary majority if voter anger in opinion polls is carried through to the ballot box.
The by-election was announced on Wednesday following Turnbull's resignation from parliament last month after he was ousted in a party-room revolt that ushered in Scott Morrison as the new prime minister.
It was the fifth change in prime minister since 2010, only one of which has been chosen at an election.
Turnbull's resignation left Morrison presiding over a minority government, at least temporarily, although five independent lawmakers have guaranteed support to defeat no-confidence votes until the by-election.
Should the affluent electorate of Wentworth, which stretches from Bondi Beach to Sydney Harbour, be lost by the Liberal Party, Morrison would be forced to strike an agreement with the independents to continue in minority government.
A safe seat for the government under Turnbull, Wentworth is now expected to be a tight race as angry voters react to the political turmoil, a poll by The Australian newspaper showed.
While the Liberal Party candidate is still expected to win the biggest share of the vote in Wentworth, the ousting of Turnbull - a social liberal who was widely popular with voters - is expected see votes flow to opposition and minor candidates, who could win under Australia's preferential voting system.
A Newspoll this week showed that national support for the ruling conservative coalition has plummeted following Turnbull's ouster and would face a heavy defeat if national elections due by May 2019 were held now.

The political backlash was already felt when the Liberal Party, the senior partner in the Liberal-National coalition, saw a 29 percent swing against it at a New South Wales state by-election at the weekend where it lost what had been a safe seat to an independent candidate.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's military is using fear and intimidation to stifle the media and undermine press freedom even as overall violence against reporters has fallen, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CJP) said on Wednesday. 
The press freedom group said the military had established ""lines of control"" to pressure the media and journalists who pushed back or were overly critical were attacked, threatened or arrested.
""The military has quietly, but effectively, set restrictions on reporting: from barring access to regions ... to encouraging self-censorship through direct and indirect methods of intimidation, including ... allegedly instigating violence against reporters,"" the CPJ said in a report.
The military routinely denies interference in politics or with the media. Its information wing could not be reached for comment by telephone nor did it respond to text messages seeking comment on the report.
Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry told Reuters no media complaints about intimidation had been lodged with his ministry but if they were, they would be investigated.
The CPJ spoke to various journalists and media organizations for its report, including Geo News, Pakistan's most popular television news channel.
In April, in the run-up to a general election, cable distributors stopped distributing Geo's programming, cutting off about 80 percent of households.
At the time, two sources at the broadcaster told Reuters the military had told it to refrain from reporting on various topics including alleged military involvement in the ouster of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
The Supreme Court forced Sharif from office in July 2017 over his failure to declare some income.
The CPJ said while it was hard to document who made the order restricting Geo's distribution and for what reason, the broadcaster was known to have had disputes with the authorities.
""Geo News's clashes with authorities started well before April 2018 and exemplify the divide between some media houses and the military ... (and) the growing use of indirect tactics to impose censorship, and the rise of self-censorship,"" it said.
'INDIRECT WAYS'
Similarly, the English-language Dawn newspaper has seen its circulation blocked in some places, which the paper's editor said pointed to military intervention.
""They're clearly not happy with Dawn's policies, they want Dawn to stay away from certain subjects,"" editor Zaffar Abbas told Reuters, adding that non-compliance was met with circulation blockages and cuts in advertising by enterprises linked to the military.
""Some papers are unable to take those pressures.""
The CPJ said military success against militants over the past few years had slashed the number of journalists being killed. But at the same time, several reporters had been attacked by unidentified men after publishing reports critical of the military.
""People in the military and sometimes in government have discovered that there are indirect ways of putting influence on the press,"" CPJ Asia coordinator Steven Butler, who wrote the report, told Reuters.
A handful of unexplained abduction and assault cases served as a reminder, he said. 
""The threat of violence is there.""

RAMGARH, India (Reuters) - Prem Malhar says his 50-year-old father died of hunger a few months ago because he did not have the Indian government's Aadhaar identity card that would have given him access to subsidized food.
At least 14 people have died of starvation in Jharkhand, the eastern Indian state where the Malhars live, activists say. They say the deaths have occurred since authorities canceled old handwritten government ration cards last year and replaced them with the biometric Aadhaar card to weed out bogus beneficiaries.
Taramani Sahu, an activist with the Right to Food Campaign, blamed the Jharkhand government for delays in issuing the Aadhaar cards after one million old cards were canceled. For some who depended on the rations for subsistence, the results were fatal, she said.
In July, three sisters under the age of 10 died of hunger in New Delhi, the capital, sparking accusations of government apathy. The deaths were not linked to possession of the Aadhaar card, but there has been widespread outrage that people are dying of hunger in a country where, according to government and industry data, grains and produce worth 580 billion rupees ($8 billion), or 40 percent of total output, go to waste every year.
Opposition parties have seized on the issue ahead of three big state elections this year and the national election in 2019, whittling into support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Modi's office did not respond to requests for comment on the starvation deaths.
Nishikant Dubey, a BJP lawmaker and a member of a parliamentary panel on the Aadhaar policy, said linking the card to welfare programs was the best way to check siphoning off funds meant for the poor. 
On the deaths, he said: ""The opposition is being irresponsible by blowing it out of proportion for political mileage.""
Malhar, who lives in a hut made of twigs, leaves and mud in a hamlet near the town of Ramgarh, says he and his brother now have the Aadhaar cards, but are still not eligible for subsidized food because of what he called ""bureaucratic ineptness"".
""My father died because he couldn't get his Aadhaar card during his lifetime and I'm not getting food because my Aadhaar card is not linked with the ration shop,"" said the 25-year-old, dressed in a red vest and tattered trousers.
Reuters spoke to three ration shop owners in the area who said they could not give subsidized food to those who did not have Aadhaar cards or failed the biometric identification process. They said the Malhars' cards were not linked to the system because that had to be done by another government department.
In the state capital, Ranchi, Jharkhand's food minister Saryu Rai said he had ordered local officials to distribute subsidized food to the poor even if they didn't possess the Aadhaar card. But activists say those orders have not been transmitted to the shop level.
Rai told Reuters it was not clear that the deaths in Jharkhand had occurred because of starvation. Officials have previously said people had died because of illness, not lack of food.
""There must be a system to know what constitutes starvation deaths and I welcome food activists to work with us on this,"" Rai said.
DIGITIZE ECONOMY
Officials in other states say they have eased rules that insist on Aadhaar. Still, activists claim that the decree has deprived some families of subsidized food in Rajasthan, a state that is also ruled by the BJP.
Aadhaar is part of an ambitious effort to digitize India's economy, and almost all transactions with the government are dependent on the card, including banking, food subsidies and tax and other payments.
Among other things, the government says the use of Aadhaar will plug theft and leakages in the $23.63 billion a year food welfare program that guarantees ultra-cheap rice and wheat to nearly two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people.
Nearly a third of the food meant for the poor gets stolen every year, with middlemen, traders and government employees colluding to sell the produce in the open market, economists estimate. The government says nearly 30 million fake and duplicate cards have been weeded out, saving about $2.35 billion.
But in a vast nation where many of the people are unschooled and dirt poor, the Aadhaar system is far from foolproof.
Some of the poor have not enrolled in the program, or their fingerprints do not match those on the database, the largest in the world. Others suffer because the identification system requires functioning electricity, an internet connection and operational servers, not always assured in interior India.
Ajay Bhushan Pandey, chief executive of the Unique Identification Authority Of India that runs the Aadhaar program, has said that connectivity and power problems do crop up, but added authorities have been told not to withhold social benefits if people can provide other, acceptable identification.
""People are dying because of government callousness,"" said Hemant Soren, the leader of the opposition and a former chief minister of Jharkhand. ""Mark my words, voters will teach them a lesson in the next election.""
In the hamlet near Ramgarh, Malhar and other men took shelter under a tree as a light drizzle came down, seeping through the makeshift roofs of their huts. They were joined by some women who said they were struggling to light damp firewood inside their huts.
Malhar lives with his 22-year-old brother Videshi in the hut with four other family members - their sole possessions are a few utensils and clothes that look like rags. They subsist on the brothers earning between 70 cents to $2.70 per day, picking through trash or working nearby rice paddies.

""We've lost our faith in the government which is responsible for my father's death,"" said Prem Malhar. ""The most unfortunate part is that authorities still continue to be callous and their callousness is starving poor families like ours.""

1390,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 12, 2018 12:51AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Trump to target foreign meddling in U.S. elections with sanctions order,"By Christopher Bing and Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order as soon as Wednesday that will slap sanctions on any foreign companies or people who interfere in U.S. elections, based on intelligence agency findings, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Trump’s decision coincides with intelligence agencies, military and law enforcement preparing to defend the Nov. 6 congressional elections from predicted foreign attacks even as Trump derides a special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections.
The White House declined to comment.
Sanction targets could include individual people or entire companies accused of interfering in U.S. elections by cyber attacks or other means, a U.S. official told Reuters. 
""The administration is keen to set a new norm in cyberspace,"" the official said. ""This is a first step in stating boundaries and publicly announcing our response for bad behavior."" 
The order represents the latest in a series of Trump administration efforts to look tough on election security before voting in November that will decide whether Trump's Republican Party can keep its majorities in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate.
The order will put a range of agencies in charge of deciding if meddling occurred, led by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and including the CIA, the National Security Agency and the Homeland Security Department, the sources said.
Based on a recent draft of the order reviewed by the U.S. official, it will require any federal agency aware of election interference by foreigners to take the information to the office of Director of National Intelligence.
Election interference will be defined in the order as hacking attempts against ""election infrastructure,"" and efforts to sway public opinion through coordinated digital propaganda or systematic leaks of private political information.
U.S. intelligence officials have found that in the campaign leading up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Russian hackers breached the Democratic National Committee and leaked confidential information.
The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal previously reported on earlier drafts of the executive order. 
Congress has been purposefully left out of the executive order drafting process, the official said, because the administration wants to preempt legislation being considered in the House and Senate that addresses similar issues.
U.S. lawmakers have introduced various pieces of Russia-related legislation, including the ""Deter Act,"" to set out punishments for election meddling, and what one lawmaker called a sanctions bill ""from hell"" to punish Moscow for cyber crime and its activities in Syria, Ukraine and elsewhere. 
Both Democrats and Republicans are looking to redress what they consider Trump's weak stance on accusations of Russian interference in 2016 when he met Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in July. Trump stunned the world by accepting Putin's denials over the word of his own intelligence agencies.
Congress passed a Russia sanctions bill more than a year ago. Some lawmakers - including some Republicans as well as Democrats - have chafed at what they saw as the administration's reluctance to implement it. Trump signed the bill only after Congress passed it with huge majorities.

Acting on that law, the U.S. Treasury imposed major sanctions against 24 Russians, striking at allies of Putin in one of Washington's most aggressive moves to punish Moscow.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia began its biggest war games since the fall of the Soviet Union on Tuesday close to its border with China, mobilising 300,000 troops in a show of force that will include joint exercises with the Chinese army.
China and Russia have staged joint drills before but not on such a large scale, and the Vostok-2018 (East-2018) exercise signals closer military ties as well as sending an unspoken reminder to Beijing that Moscow is able and ready to defend its sparsely populated far east.
Vostok-2018 is taking place at a time of heightened tension between the West and Russia, and NATO has said it will monitor the exercise closely, as will the United States which has a strong military presence in the Asia-Pacific region.
Russia's Ministry of Defence broadcast images on Tuesday of columns of tanks, armoured vehicles and warships on the move, and combat helicopters and fighter aircraft taking off. 
In one clip, marines from Russia's Northern Fleet and a motorised Arctic brigade were shown disembarking from a large landing ship on a barren shore opposite Alaska. 
This activity was part of the first stage of the exercise, which runs until Sept. 17, the ministry said in a statement. It involved deploying additional forces to Russia's far east and a naval build-up involving its Northern and Pacific fleets.
The main aim was to check the military's readiness to move troops large distances, to test how closely infantry and naval forces cooperated, and to perfect command and control procedures. Later stages will involve rehearsals of both defensive and offensive scenarios.
Russia also staged a major naval exercise in the eastern Mediterranean this month and its jets resumed bombing the Syrian region of Idlib, the last major enclave of rebels fighting its ally President Bashar al-Assad.
CLOSER CHINA-RUSSIA TIES 
The location of the main training range for Vostok-2018 5,000 km (3,000 miles) east of Moscow means it is likely to be watched closely by Japan, North and South Korea as well as by China and Mongolia, both of whose armies will take part in the manoeuvres later this week.
Analysts say Moscow had to invite the Chinese and Mongolian militaries given the proximity of the war games to their borders and because the scale meant the neighbouring countries would probably have seen them as a threat had they been excluded.
The exercise - which will involve more than 1,000 military aircraft, two Russian naval fleets, up to 36,000 tanks and armoured vehicles and all Russian airborne units - began as President Vladimir Putin held talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the Russian port city of Vladivostok.
Relations between Moscow and Beijing have long been marked by mutual wariness with Russian nationalists warning of encroaching Chinese influence in the country's mineral-rich far east. 
But Russia pivoted east towards China after the West sanctioned Moscow over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014 and trade links between the two, who share a land border over 4,200 km long, have blossomed since.
Russia broadcast footage of some of 24 helicopters and six jets belonging to the Chinese air force landing at Russian air bases for the exercise. Beijing has said 3,200 members of the People's Liberation Army will join in.
China's official People's Liberation Army Daily said on Wednesday that the drill was aimed at maintaining regional peace, was not aimed at any third party and did not ""have anything to do with the regional situation"".
""The Chinese officers and soldiers participating in the drills will demonstrate the determination and ability to maintain regional peace and stability with practical actions,"" it said.
Some experts see the war games as a message to Washington, with which both Moscow and Beijing have strained ties.
""With its Vostok 2018 exercise Russia sends a message that it regards the U.S. as a potential enemy and China as a potential ally,"" wrote Dmitri Trenin, a former Russian army colonel and director of the Carnegie Moscow Center think tank. 
""China, by sending a PLA element to train with the Russians, is signalling that U.S. pressure is pushing it towards much closer military cooperation with Moscow."" 
When asked if he was concerned about a potential military alliance between Russia and China in the future, U.S. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said he did not see the two countries aligned in the long-term.
""I think that nations act out of their interest. I see little in the long-term that aligns Russia and China,"" Mattis told reporters in Washington. 
Putin, who is armed forces commander-in-chief, is expected to observe the exercises this week alongside Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, who is overseeing them. 
Shoigu has said they are the biggest since a Soviet military exercise, Zapad-81 (West-81) in 1981.

(Reuters) - The owner of a restaurant popular with presidential hopefuls and a former police chief won major party nominating contests on Tuesday and will face off in November in a notoriously fickle congressional district in New Hampshire, seen as a key prize with control of Congress at stake.
Former state legislator Chris Pappas, a member of the state's executive council administrative body, won the Democratic race to succeed retiring Democrat Carol Shea-Porter in New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District, which has flipped four times between the two major parties this decade, tending to reflect the national political winds. 
The Republican nominee was Eddie Edwards, a former police chief who defeated state Senator Andy Sanborn. He was supported by President Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and if elected, would be the first black congressman from the state.
Holding the district is crucial for Democrats as they seek to gain 23 seats to capture a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives and try to thwart Trump's Republican agenda.
All 435 seats in the House, as well as one-third of the 100-member Senate, will be up for grabs in the Nov. 6 elections.
Pappas emerged from a crowded primary of 11 people, with his most notable competition coming from former Obama administration official and U.S. Marine Corps veteran Maura Sullivan.
Edwards, meanwhile, won on the Republican side in a race with six people competing. 
Political oddsmaking firms say this race leans to the Democrats; shortly after Pappas was confirmed as the winner, the projection firm Cook Political Report shifted the race to ""likely Democratic"" from ""lean Democratic."" 
Voter dissatisfaction with Trump's leadership has powered gains by Democrats in special elections at the federal and state level over the past 18 months. They are currently seen as modest favorites to retake the House. 
Pappas was endorsed by three of the four members of the state's all-female congressional delegation. He is co-owner of the Puritan Backroom, a Manchester restaurant well-known for presidential candidate visits ahead of the state's first-in-the-nation nominating primary. Manchester, which is part of the district, is the largest city in the state. 
SWING DISTRICT
The district has a history of voting for the presidential winner - and then going against the party that holds the White House in subsequent congressional elections. Former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama won the district twice, while Trump carried it by 1 percentage point over Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Another notable candidate in the Democratic race was Levi Sanders, son of U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of neighboring Vermont, who ran unsuccessfully for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. The Vermont lawmaker, despite endorsing dozens of candidates across the country, had not backed his son.
Sanders, who was criticized for not living in the district, had garnered only about 2 percent of the vote with about 50 percent of precincts counted.
Voters also picked former Democratic state Senator Molly Kelly to challenge popular incumbent Republican Governor Chris Sununu in November. Seven Republicans were competing to take on Congresswoman Ann Kuster in the state's second congressional district, which Cook now rates as ""solid Democratic."" 

This week will set the final congressional match-ups ahead of the November general election, with Rhode Island set to vote on Wednesday. New York voters, who have already picked nominees for Congress, pick candidates on Thursday for governor and other state races.

XALAPA, Mexico (Reuters) - Families gathered at a morgue in Mexico on Tuesday to comb through the remains of more than 150 bodies discovered at graves in southern Veracruz state, hunting for clues that could identify children and siblings who disappeared long ago. 
""We still hope we can find her,"" Paloma Martinez said of her older sister, now missing for two years.
""My mother and I are here to see if there are ID cards or clothes or any clue that show us that she's here ... we've lived with anguish, and questions without answers.""
Investigators discovered 166 skulls in 32 graves last week on a tip from an unidentified person, Veracruz's attorney general said on Thursday, adding that the bodies were likely dumped less than two years ago. [nL2N1VT00D]
Further investigations indicated that the remains belonged to at least 174 bodies, the attorney general's office said in a statement on Friday, when it showed photographs of findings from the graves to families of missing people.
Violent crime has long plagued Veracruz, a key route for drug gangs sending narcotics north towards the United States. 
Authorities last year found more than 250 skulls in unmarked graves in Veracruz, an oil-rich state on Mexico's Gulf Coast. 
Hundreds of bodies in unmarked graves have also been found in states including Tamaulipas, Durango and Morelos during a decade-long drug war led by the military to battle the cartels, which led to increasingly bloody turf wars. 
""This is the Veracruz we have, the Veracruz where we line up to see the remains of bodies,"" said Lucia Diaz, director of Solecito Collective, a support group for parents of missing children. ""Nobody could have imagined it would come to this."" 
No family has yet found evidence from the remains in the graves uncovered last week to be able to identify a child, sibling or relative, she said. 
Imelda Fernandez, wearing a surgical mask that had been handed to all family members at the morgue, said her son left the house one morning two years ago and never returned, leaving no trace.

""I think of him every day,"" she said. ""I'd like to find him one day and know what became of him, no matter whether he's dead or alive.""

SHANKSVILLE, Pa. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday praised the men and women of United Flight 93 for saving countless lives when they struggled with hijackers on Sept. 11, 2001, and called the field where the plane went down a monument to ""American defiance.""
Commemorating the 17th anniversary of the attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center in New York and struck the Pentagon outside Washington, Trump said the nation shared the grief of the family members whose loved ones were lost that day.
""We grieve together for every mother and father, sister and brother, son and daughter, who was stolen from us at the Twin Towers, the Pentagon and here in this Pennsylvania field,"" Trump said. 
Commemorations also took place in New York and Washington to mark the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks by al Qaeda, in which nearly 3,000 people were killed.
Flight 93 was heading to San Francisco from Newark, New Jersey, when passengers stormed the plane's cockpit and sought to take control from the hijackers. All were killed when the plane crashed in a field, preventing what was thought to be another planned target in Washington.
Family members of Flight 93, some of their voices breaking, read aloud the names of the 40 passengers and crew members who died. Memorial bells tolled.
Trump and his wife, Melania, traveled to the Flight 93 National Memorial from Washington and paused for a moment of reflection while overlooking the field where the plane crashed.
""They boarded the plane as strangers and they entered eternity linked forever as true heroes,"" Trump said of the passengers and crew.
""This field is now a monument to American defiance. This memorial is now a message to the world: America will never, ever submit to tyranny.""
Trump is still dealing with the consequences of that day, with the war in Afghanistan, launched in response to the attacks, now America’s longest. He cited the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in his remarks, saying: ""Nearly 7,000 service members have died facing down the menace of radical Islamic terrorism.""
In New York, the Bell of Hope rang out at St. Paul's Chapel to mark the moment at 8:46 a.m. when the first of two hijacked planes hit the World Trade Center. The bell has been rung on every anniversary since 2002, when it was presented to New York by the City of London to honor those who died.
Mourners gathered at the National September 11 Memorial plaza in Manhattan for the annual reading of victims' names. 
Members of the U.N. Security Council stood for a moment of silence led by U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley.

The statement by the White House press secretary accused Iran of not preventing attacks in recent days on the U.S. Consulate in Basra and the American Embassy compound in Baghdad.
""Iran did not act to stop these attacks by its proxies in Iraq, which it has supported with funding, training, and weapons,"" the statement said.
""The United States will hold the regime in Tehran accountable for any attack that results in injury to our personnel or damage to United States Government facilities. America will respond swiftly and decisively in defense of American lives,"" the statement said.
On Friday, three mortar bombs landed inside Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone, where the U.S. Embassy is located, but they caused no casualties or damage, the Iraqi military said.
The mortar attack was the first such one in several years on the Green Zone, which houses parliament, government buildings and many foreign embassies.
The U.S. Consulate in Basra is near the airport, which was attacked by rockets on Saturday. No damage or casualties were reported.

Protesters in Basra angry over political corruption ransacked and torched Iraqi government buildings last week. The Iranian consulate was set alight by demonstrators shouting condemnation of what many see as Iran's sway over Iraq's affairs.

1398,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 10:56PM ET</span>","U.S. voices concern on China's Muslim crackdown, sanctions weighed","By Matt Spetalnick and Steve Holland
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Tuesday expressed deep concern over China's ""worsening crackdown"" on minority Muslims in the Xinjiang region, as the Trump administration considered sanctions against Chinese senior officials and companies linked to allegations of human rights abuses.
Discussions have gained momentum within the U.S. government over possible economic penalties in response to reports of mass detentions of ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims, which has prompted a growing international outcry, U.S. congressional sources said.
Any sanctions decision would be a rare move on human rights grounds by the Trump administration against China, with which it is engaged in a trade war while also seeking Beijing's help to resolve a standoff over North Korea's nuclear weapons.
A U.S. official said the idea of sanctions was still in the discussion stage, and one of the congressional sources said a decision did not appear to be imminent.
""We're deeply troubled by the worsening crackdown, not just on Uighurs (but also) Kazakhs, other Muslims in that region of China,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a news briefing, renewing concerns expressed in recent months by top administration officials.
Nauert acknowledged that the State Department had received a letter from a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers at the end of August asking Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to impose sanctions on a number of Chinese officials accused of overseeing the policies. Those included Chen Quanguo, Communist Party chief in Xinjiang and also a member of the Party's politburo.
Also under consideration are sanctions the lawmakers sought against several Chinese companies involved in building detention camps and creating surveillance systems used to track and monitor Uighurs, according to one of the congressional sources.
Nauert declined to discuss details of any U.S. government action. ""We're not going to preview any sanctions that may or may not happen,"" Nauert said.
The Washington-based Uyghur Human Rights Project tweeted a photo of activist Dolkun Isa, president of World Uyghur Congress, at the White House on Monday along with the comment, ""A meeting with White House officials today provided much-needed encouragement for Uyghur human-rights advocates.""
Isa, speaking to Reuters by telephone from Brussels, where he said he was due to meet EU officials on Wednesday, declined to say which White House officials he had met in Washington.
Isa said he had the impression from the Americans that ""they are seriously considering"" imposing sanctions on senior Chinese officials, including Chen, the Party chief in the far western region. 
China earlier on Tuesday called for United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet to respect its sovereignty after she urged Beijing to allow monitors into the region and expressed concern about the situation there.
Beijing has said Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tension between the mostly Muslim Uighur minority who call the region home and members of the ethnic Han Chinese majority.
Last month, a U.N. rights panel said it had received credible reports that up to one million ethnic Uighurs may be held in extra-legal detention in Xinjiang, and called for them to be freed.
""There are credible reports out there that many, many thousands have been detained in detention centers since April 2017, and the numbers are fairly significant from what we can tell so far,"" Nauert said.

U.S. sanctions could be imposed under the Global Magnitsky Act, a federal law that allows the U.S. government to target human rights violators around the world with freezes on any U.S. assets, U.S. travel bans, and prohibitions on Americans doing business with them.

By Tom Miles
GENEVA (Reuters) - Many governments are neglecting or ignoring their duty to protect online encryption that helps ensure freedom of expression and privacy, the U.N. expert on freedom of expression said on Monday.
In many states including Russia, China, Iran, Turkey, Pakistan and Britain, citizens cannot count on keeping their online conversations private, according to a report prepared for the U.N. Human Rights Council by special rapporteur David Kaye.
There had been a surge in state restrictions on encryption in the past three years, Kaye wrote in a report submitted to a three-week session of the Council that began on Monday.
""Since 2015, states have intensified their efforts to weaken encryption used in widely available communications products and services,"" the report said. 
It said pressure has been mounting for companies to install ""backdoors"" in software to give law enforcement officials access to encrypted messages or secured devices, thereby giving hackers a potential vulnerability to exploit, even though governments already have many other investigative tools they could use.
""A state's obligations to respect and ensure the rights to freedom of opinion and expression and to privacy include the responsibility to protect encryption,"" the report said.
It said other measures that systematically weaken encryption and digital security, such as key escrows and data localization requirements, also interfere with users' rights.
Limits to encryption must be necessary, legal, legitimate and proportional, the report said. Blanket bans plainly did not meet those conditions. 
But many states had criminalized the use of encryption, the report said, citing Iran's 2010 ban, Pakistan's ""vague criminal prohibitions"" which could be interpreted to crack down on encryption tools, and Turkey's detention of thousands of citizens for using an encrypted messaging app. 
Other countries, including Russia, Vietnam and Malawi, required government approval of encryption tools. Russia and Iran had both banned the Telegram messaging app, after the company refused to give up the encryption keys.
China's 2016 Cybersecurity Law requires network operators to “provide technical support and assistance” to state and public security for national security and law enforcement, while Uganda and Mexico use malware to monitor government critics, according to the report. 
Britain's 2016 Investigatory Powers Act, known by critics as the ""Snoopers' Charter"", gave the government vaguely formulated powers that could oblige network operators to include backdoors, remove end-to-end encryption and cooperate with a wide range of government hacking measures, the report said. 

It recommended that states pass laws spelling out permissible restrictions on encryption and anonymity.

1400,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 10:31PM ET</span>",China's small farmers pose huge challenge in swine fever battle,"By Hallie Gu and Dominique Patton
HARBIN, China (Reuters) - Even after 14 outbreaks of African swine fever across China in just over a month, pig farmer Wang Wu does not believe the threat to his livelihood is real. 
""I heard about the African swine fever thing. But then people said it was just rumor. It was fake news,"" said Wang, who raises about 60 pigs in a village near Harbin, capital of China's northeastern Heilongjiang province.
In any case, the disease was only present in the south, added Wang. In fact, the first outbreak was reported in Shenyang, also in the northeast. And Harbin is only 500 kilometers from Russia, where African swine fever (ASF) has been spreading for years. 
The farmer's lack of awareness of the virus highlights the scale of the challenge Beijing faces in controlling the highly contagious disease, which has spread rapidly among the world's largest hog herd since it was first detected in early August.
There is no vaccine for ASF and mortality rates can be as high as 100 percent. The virus is also hardy, surviving for months in pork, feed or swill. It is not harmful to humans.
(Swine fever in China: https://tmsnrt.rs/2PDt6Ud)
(China pig farming structure in 2016: https://reut.rs/2CLfhBn)
In an effort to check the spread of the virus, authorities have banned the transport of live hogs from and through affected areas, sending prices in some regions soaring.
But while industrialized pig producers in China have locked down their farms, cancelling leave for staff who live onsite and reducing feed deliveries and outside visitors who risk spreading the virus to their pigs, many small pig farmers interviewed by Reuters in the past week have done nothing to keep the disease at bay.
That is likely a major reason for the number of outbreaks on farms of a similar size to Wang's, say experts.
""You have to know what the risks are,"" said an animal health expert at one of China's biggest pig producers. ""If a small farmer isn't aware, he can't manage those risks.""
NOT GETTING THROUGH
Farmers producing fewer than 500 pigs a year accounted for 42 percent of China's production in 2016, according to a research report from Rabobank. In eastern Anhui province, which has reported the most cases to date, there are still few large farms compared with other regions, said Pan Chenjun, senior analyst at the bank.
Beijing said last month it had launched a major education campaign on how to prevent the spread of the disease. It also collaborated with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization from 2014 to 2015 on a project to develop prevention and control strategies for African swine fever. 
That included awareness-raising in rural communities, and in particular in Heilongjiang province, where Wang lives. Booklets on the virus were also distributed to farmers and vets across the country, according to the project details.
But the rapid spread of the disease in recent weeks raises questions about how effective those efforts were.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not respond to a fax seeking comment on the issue.
Wang, who raises his pigs in open pens and buys feed from door-to-door salesmen, did not require any disinfecting on a recent visit, a standard measure for preventing the spread of disease on farms.
Another farmer near Harbin, 65-year-old Zhang Chao, also knew little of the swine fever outbreaks. Local authorities recently supplied several bottles of disinfectant to his farm of several dozen pigs, said Zhang, and asked him and his wife to carry out thorough disinfection. But the couple did not know why.
""I am just a small pig farmer. What difference does it make if I know about it or not? What can I do?,"" asked Zhang.
CONSOLIDATION OPPORTUNITY?
Bigger farmers appear better informed. At a farm with 400 sows on the outskirts of Beijing, owner Ma said she had attended a government meeting on the disease several weeks ago. She declined to give her full name.
An official poster on her farm wall showed pictures of symptoms to watch out for, and described measures to prevent its spread.
Those included preventing pigs from coming into contact with infected feed, meat products and equipment, and raising pigs far from areas with wild boars.
""This disease is really terrifying,"" said Ma's farm technician Wang Liang. ""For ourselves, we make sure we disinfect everything when we arrive, and the less contact with outsiders the better.""
Reaching and educating China's millions of backyard farmers in remote regions, including the many operating under the government's radar, may be an impossible task, said experts.
""They're firefighters,"" said Pan at Rabobank, referring to the authorities' efforts to control the outbreak. ""They'll go to the affected regions first but they don't have so much manpower. They can't cover everywhere immediately.""
African swine fever may also push Beijing to shut down more small farms and further promote large players with a better grasp of biosecurity and the resources to invest in such systems, said industry participants, a push already under way.

""My clients are still expanding,"" said a Shanghai-based farm management consultant who advises large producers in China. ""They think this will be a good opportunity.""

1402,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 07:38PM ET</span>",Supreme Court nominee emails reignite Democratic query on past testimony,"By Richard Cowan and Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic senator on Tuesday raised new questions about whether U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has accurately described his role in a controversial judicial nomination when he worked for then-President George W. Bush.
Emails previously withheld as ""committee confidential"" but released by the office of Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, suggest that Kavanaugh, a White House lawyer at the time, cast light on his involvement in the nomination of William Haynes, a controversial Department of Defense lawyer, for an appeals court position.
White House spokesman Raj Shah said the emails are consistent with Kavanaugh's testimony and called Durbin's actions a ""pathetic attempt"" to smear the nominee.
President Donald Trump's nomination of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court is now in the hands of the U.S. Senate. Republicans control the 51 Senate votes needed to confirm Kavanaugh if they stick together.
Democrats are trying hard to raise questions about the nominee because they see Kavanaugh tilting the court even further to the right. A final Senate vote is expected by the end of September.
Kavanaugh told Durbin in 2006, when Bush nominated him to his current position as an appeals court judge in Washington, that the Haynes nomination was not one he ""handled.""
One 2002 email released by Durbin showed Kavanaugh weighing in on a suggestion that Haynes be nominated for a vacancy on the Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, questioning if he was conservative enough.
""But what is the basis for saying he would be an across-the- board judicial conservative?"" Kavanaugh asked.
An email from 2003 from then-White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales invited Kavanaugh to play golf with Haynes.
In releasing the emails, Durbin revived his own long-simmering dispute dating to Kavanaugh's 2006 confirmation hearing. Durbin had asked then about whether Kavanaugh was involved in the Haynes nomination.
The White House pointed to a question from another senator at the same 2006 hearing, in which Kavanaugh said ""yes"" when asked if he would have been involved in discussions on the Haynes nomination if it came up. Kavanaugh said he could not recall such conversations.
In a statement, Durbin sought to tie Kavanaugh's Haynes testimony to several other issues on which Democrats say Kavanaugh gave misleading answers during his confirmation hearing last week, including whether he was involved in the Bush administration's interrogation policies.
“This is a theme that we see emerge with Judge Kavanaugh time and time again. He says one thing under oath, and then the documents tell a different story,"" Durbin said

As general counsel at the Pentagon, Haynes was involved in detainee and interrogation policy decisions after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. He was not ultimately confirmed.

1403,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 07:31PM ET</span>",Founder of Peru Shining Path rebellion given second life sentence,"LIMA (Reuters) - A Peruvian court on Tuesday handed down a second life sentence to the founder of the Shining Path rebel group, Abimael Guzman, finding him guilty of orchestrating a car bomb attack in an upscale neighborhood of Lima in 1992 that left 25 people dead and 155 wounded.
The bombing on the residential street of Tarata was the Shining Path's deadliest attack on civilians in the capital, contributing to a sense of panic in the city about an insurgency that had already killed thousands of people in the remote Andes and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Guzman, 83, is already serving a life sentence for terrorism since his capture in 1992. The trial over whether he was a mastermind of the Tarata bombing had been repeatedly delayed in the past four years, partly because Guzman said he was too ill to participate. He has denied involvement in the Tarata bombing. 
His attorney, Alfredo Crespo, said before the sentencing that Guzman believes lower-level rebels carried it out without his knowledge. 
According to Peru's truth commission, on July 16, 1992, Shining Path rebels left the car loaded with explosives on Tarata after being thwarted from parking it in front of a bank. 
""I remember people running from one place to another, bloodied and shouting. It was horrible,"" Vanesa Quiroga, who lost her leg in the attack when she was 12, was quoted as saying in a 2003 report by the commission. ""My mom ran around looking for my leg ... but she couldn't find it.""
Guzman looked at the floor during much of the sentencing session that stretched for more than six hours, appearing to fall asleep at times.
Inspired by communist China's founder Mao Zedong, Guzman, a former philosophy professor who built a small, cult-like following that continues to revere him today, sought to incite a peasant rebellion in the Andes to overthrow the state and install a communist state.
An estimated 69,000 people, mostly in Peru's poor interior, were killed between 1980 and 2000 in the internal conflict launched by the Shining Path.
The Tarata attack was one of 37 car bombings in Lima in the first seven months of 1992, helping to build support for autocratic measures taken by former president Alberto Fujimori.
Fujimori was sentenced to 25 years in prison for ordering death squads to kill civilians in a counterinsurgency campaign, but was pardoned last year by former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who resigned in scandal in March.

Several other former leaders of the Shining Path were given life sentences for the Tarata bombing at Peru's National Criminal Court on Tuesday.

The Agriculture Bill, primarily covering England, will provide the basis for policy in a sector which for decades has been controlled by the European Union.
""After nearly 50 years of being tied to burdensome and outdated EU rules, we have the opportunity to deliver a Green Brexit,"" Britain's farming and environment minister Michael Gove said in a statement.
The bill includes a seven-year transition period to allow farmers time to adjust as direct support payments linked to the amount of land they farm to be phased out.
Under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy, British farmers receive about 3 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) a year in public funds.
""The bill allows us to reward farmers who protect our environment, leaving the countryside in a cleaner, greener and healthier state for future generations,"" Gove said.
""Critically, we will also provide the smooth and gradual transition that farmers and land managers need to plan ahead.""
Farmers will see a reduction in payments during the transition period with the biggest cuts for those receiving the most funds.
Direct payments will eventually be replaced by a new Environmental Land Management System which will be developed and trialed with farmers.
""Under the new system, farmers and land managers who provide the greatest environmental benefits will secure the largest rewards,"" the minister said.
Under the devolution of agricultural policy in the United Kingdom, Scotland will not take powers from the bill.
However, the Welsh government will have powers under the bill to pursue its own reforms and provisions of the bill will extend to Northern Ireland until it can creates its own legislation.
Britain's decision in 2016 to leave the EU becomes effective in March 2019.

Macedonia scheduled the referendum on the government's deal in June with neighboring Greece to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia which would open the door for it to join NATO and the European Union.

Mattis said he wanted to make it clear the United States supported the Macedonian people.
NATO invited Macedonia to begin accession talks with the alliance, but said it would have to change its constitution and adopt the new name first. The EU has also said it would set a date for Macedonian accession talks pending implementation of the name deal.
Moscow's ambassador to Skopje has criticized Macedonia's ambitions to join NATO, saying it could become ""a legitimate target"" if relations between NATO and Russia deteriorate further.
Greece, a member of both NATO and the EU, has refused to accept the Balkan country's name, saying it implies territorial claims on the Greek province of Macedonia and amounts to an appropriation of its ancient civilization. 
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government, elected in 2017, pushed for an agreement with Greece. Nationalists, including President Gjorge Ivanov, oppose the deal saying it is against the constitution.
In July, Greece expelled two Russian diplomats and barred two other people from entering the country, accusing them of having meddled by encouraging demonstrations and bribing unidentified officials to thwart the Macedonia agreement.

Russia has denied wrongdoing and responded in kind with expulsions of Greeks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Eleven Republican and Democratic U.S. senators urged President Donald Trump's administration to ""use all tools at your disposal,"" including imposing more economic sanctions, to ensure ""the immediate, unconditional"" release of two Reuters journalists imprisoned in Myanmar.
""We write today with great concern regarding the case of two Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who were wrongfully detained and sentenced to seven years in prison in Burma,"" the senators, led by Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Jeff Merkley, both members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, which was seen by Reuters on Tuesday.
The letter was signed by six Democrats and five Republicans. 
The journalists were found guilty on official secrets charges and sentenced earlier this month in a landmark case seen as a test of progress toward democracy in Myanmar. The country, also known as Burma, was ruled by a military junta until 2011.
The government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has come under increasing diplomatic pressure over a security crackdown sparked by attacks by Rohingya Muslim insurgents on security forces in Rakhine State in west Myanmar in August 2017.
The journalists were investigating the killing of Rohingya villagers by security forces at the time of their arrest last December, and had pleaded not guilty.
Their imprisonment has prompted an international outpouring of support, including a call for their release by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence.
The senators said they appreciated Pompeo raising the case in August with Myanmar's foreign minister, Kyaw Tin, and calling for their immediate release, but said there should be further action.

Last month, the United States imposed sanctions on four Myanmar military and police commanders and two army units, accusing them of ""ethnic cleansing"" against Rohingya Muslims and widespread human rights abuses.

IDLIB, Syria (Reuters) - Syrians escaping violence in Idlib have arrived in villages near the Turkish border in droves, fearing Damascus will launch a full-blown assault on the rebel stronghold.
More than 30,000 people have fled their homes in northwest Syria since the army and allied forces resumed bombardment last week, the U.N. humanitarian affairs office (OCHA) said on Monday. It said a military offensive could trigger the worst humanitarian catastrophe of the 21st century.
""What happened was destruction all over, burning, something you can't describe,"" said Ali al-Mheymid, 50, who escaped the village of Sarjah in Idlib province with his family last week.
""They did not differentiate between civilians and others,"" he told Reuters from a village near the Bab al-Hawa crossing with Turkey. He has moved into a tent there with 13 relatives in a makeshift settlement after paying the landowner rent. 
Mheymid, who has five children, said people fled in the hundreds, some bringing only blankets and kitchen supplies. ""People are hoping that right now, here is safer than there, but God knows what's coming."" 
If government forces advance further toward them, they would have no choice but to move to the Turkish frontier, he added. ""There is no escape.""
Damascus and Moscow say they only target armed factions and seek to end the rule of al Qaeda-linked militants over the Idlib region. Idlib makes up a major chunk of Syria's northwest corner, the last bastion of opposition to President Bashar al-Assad. 
The presidents of Turkey, Iran and Russia met in Tehran last week but did not agree a ceasefire that would prevent an expected offensive. 
Ankara, which hosts some 3.5 million refugees, has said it could not take any more if an attack on Idlib drove a new surge of people toward its border. President Tayyip Erdogan wrote on Tuesday that an offensive would spark humanitarian and security risks for Turkey, Europe and beyond. 
The Turkish military, which is deployed across an arc of northwest Syria near Idlib with its rebel allies, has also set up 12 observation posts around Idlib this year. 
About half of those displaced so far have moved to camps, while others went to informal settlements, stayed with families or rented housing, OCHA spokesman David Swanson said on Monday. 
Mamdouh Abu al-Saoud, who fled with his wife and three daughters, said he worried the fighting would only get worse. 
""What will we do? Every time it follows us, we escape a meter to the north and leave it up to God, where will we go?"" he said. His family, along with brothers and cousins, arrived in the informal camp near Bab al-Hawa three days ago. 
Saoud said years of war had already forced them to flee many times before, first from their hometown in Hama province, then to live as refugees in neighboring Jordan. They later went to southern Syria, only to move again in a withdrawal deal when government forces defeated rebels there around two months ago. 
""We had come (to Idlib) without anything,"" he said. 
An influx of displaced people has roughly doubled the Idlib region's population to around 2.9 million people in recent years. Civilians and fighters have poured in, shuttled out of towns and cities where Assad's military crushed rebels with the help of Russia and Iran. 
""The first day of the bombing, we said it might dwindle down. The next day, there was more,"" said Hussein al-Okab, 43, who came to the informal settlement with his wife and seven kids. ""A warplane struck my uncle's sheep.""

He said entire villages were emptied.

Spanish news website eldiario.es reported on Monday that Monton had been awarded grades without attending classes or having contact with professors when she obtained her master's degree at Madrid's Rey Juan Carlos university.
Broadcaster La Sexta said on Tuesday it had tracked down her final project and found it contained plagiarized passages. 
Monton denied those reports but said she was stepping down anyway, to avoid the situation affecting the government. 
Sanchez took power after toppling his predecessor with a confidence vote over a long-running corruption scandal. 
Anti-austerity group Podemos said Monton had no option but to resign if she could not explain the situation.
Monton's departure follows that of Maxim Huerta, who resigned as culture minister in June just a week after taking office, over a tax fine related to his income 10 years ago.
Rey Juan Carlos university has been connected with other recent scandals involving accusations that politicians held improperly obtained qualifications.

The previous head of the Madrid regional government and the head of the opposition People's Party received academic titles there which attracted accusations of malpractice, which both denied.

1411,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 03:55PM ET</span>",Hungary's Orban vows to defy EU pressure ahead of unprecedented vote,"By Alastair Macdonald
STRASBOURG, France (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban told the European Parliament on Tuesday he would not bow to EU ""blackmail"" as lawmakers prepared to vote on whether to punish Budapest for eroding democracy.
Some momentum might have been building against Orban during the evening ahead of the Wednesday vote. But it was still unclear whether the 751-strong European Parliament would be able to muster the two-thirds majority needed to pass the censure motion, which accuses Hungary of breaching core EU values. 
Since sweeping to power in 2010, Orban has pressured Hungary's courts, media and non-governmental groups, as well as refusing to take in asylum seekers arriving in Europe. Though the European Union has often protested, it has largely failed to stop what his critics decry as his growing authoritarianism.
If approved, the motion would go to the EU's national leaders, theoretically opening the way for sanctions such as a suspension of Hungary's voting rights in the bloc. 
But in practice that is sure to be blocked by Orban's ally, the nationalist government in Poland that is locked in its own dispute with the EU over undercutting the rule of law.
Directly addressing EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, Orban cast Wednesday's vote as an act of revenge for his refusal to host refugees who have fled to Europe from the Middle East and North Africa since 2015.
""Hungary shall not bow to blackmail,"" said Orban, whose right-wing Fidesz party was re-elected with a landslide majority last April. 
""Hungary shall continue to defend its borders, stop illegal immigration and defend its rights – against you, too, if necessary,"" he said, drawing applause from the eurosceptic, far-right lawmakers in the assembly.
Orban has said the mostly Muslim refugees pose an existential threat to Europe's Christian civilization. He has also waged a vociferous campaign against Hungarian-born, Jewish American billionaire philanthropist George Soros and the liberal causes he backs in formerly-communist eastern Europe.
BROAD CRITICISM
The motion against Orban's Hungary goes well beyond the migration issue.
The deputy head of the European Commission, Frans Timmermans, said on Tuesday he shared its authors' concerns about ""fundamental rights, corruption, the treatment of Roma and the independence of the judiciary"" in Hungary under Orban.
Former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, a leading liberal, said Hungary would never have been allowed to join the EU in 2004 had it been back then as it has now become under Orban. The group of leftists and greens in the assembly said ""Orban's authoritarian moves must be curbed"".
Dutch lawmaker Sophie in 't Veld urged the EU to consider cutting generous subsidies to Hungary, asking: ""Why are we giving Mr Orban 87 million euros a week in order to destroy the European Union?"" 
Even Orban's fellow migration hardliner, Austria's Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, unexpectedly said his party's five European lawmakers would vote against Budapest.
""We believe that there can be no compromises on the rule of law and democracy,"" Kurz told ORF television.
Greek members of the group were planning to do the same.
But Italy's anti-immigration Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said his League party's six EU lawmakers would support Orban.
The parties of Kurz and Orban both belong to the biggest faction in the European Parliament, the conservative European People's Party (EPP), which also includes lawmakers from the party of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The EPP membership has muted EU reaction to Orban's policies over the years and the big question mark is what the group's 217 members will now do.
The vote represents a particular challenge for EPP's German head Manfred Weber since he announced his bid for the presidency of the EU's executive Commission next year.
On Tuesday Weber said the EU might need to consider launching the sanctions procedure, under Article 7.1 of the bloc's Lisbon Treaty, if Budapest did not address the criticisms.
The EPP decided on Tuesday evening that its lawmakers would vote freely without a unified stance from the whole group. Orban might have lost some key allies as EPP lawmakers said their caucus meeting showed many would vote in favor of Article 7.
But the vote was still hard to call.

To become the first-ever case of the European Parliament asking EU capitals to launch the punitive mechanism against one of their own, it must win the backing of at least 376 lawmakers and two thirds of the votes cast.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who recently visited Kabul, said on Tuesday that the Afghan government was increasing the vetting and training of local forces in order to minimize so-called insider attacks.
A U.S. service member was killed in an apparent insider attack in eastern Afghanistan earlier this month and a member of a U.S. army training unit was shot dead by an Afghan soldier in the southern province of Uruzgan in July. 
Mattis visited Kabul last week and met with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who brought up the issue of insider attacks.
""There's increased vetting going on...they are bringing in more people that we have helped train to know how to do it, to make certain we're catching people who have been radicalized,"" Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon.
""There's a lot of attention from their military side that's actually in the field with the troops and by attention I mean training of their people and how they protect the coalition troops,"" Mattis added. 
Insider attacks, often known as “green on blue” attacks in which Afghan service members or attackers wearing Afghan uniforms fire on U.S. or coalition troops, have been a regular feature of the conflict in Afghanistan, although their frequency has diminished in recent years.
Coalition forces have in the past tightened security and added extra force protection measures including special “Guardian Angel” units to accompany training units.
Mattis also said that the United States was getting mixed messages from Taliban militants and while they were increasing violence in some parts of the country, they had also shown more of an interest in reconciliation.
""I think there is a fair amount of what I would call non-quantifiable factors that are mounting in terms of going in the right direction,"" Mattis said.
A suicide bomber in Afghanistan killed at least 32 people and wounded more than 120 at a demonstration on Tuesday on the highway between the eastern city of Jalalabad and the main border crossing into neighboring Pakistan.

Violence has flared across the nation, with heavy fighting in northern provinces, and officials have said it is likely to intensify before parliamentary elections next month and a presidential election in April.

In a preliminary report last week, Mexico's civil aviation agency said bad weather likely caused the crash, adding that there was no evidence of human error or mechanical failures. The agency, however, found that a pilot in training, who was not authorized by the company, briefly served as copilot during the takeoff.
In response, Aeromexico last week said it had fired the three pilots who were in the cabin and announced new rules for crew, including the elimination of a provision that allowed pilots to fly in the cabin for free.
Pilots union ASPA, whose members include Aeromexico, said that the provision is critical for pilots who use it to travel from their homes to the airline's base. 
""Aeromexico decided unilaterally to suspend the benefit of Crew Flying in Cabin, among other violations of the collective contract, affecting a critical clause for around 2,400 pilots,"" the union said in a statement, adding that such benefits are common among other airlines.
In late July, a Mexico City-bound Embraer 190 passenger jet operated by Aeromexico smashed into scrubland near the runway shortly after take-off during what passengers have described as strong winds, hail and rain.
All 103 passengers and crew survived by evacuating from the plane before it was engulfed by flames.
On Tuesday, Aeromexico shares were trading flat at 1920 GMT after slipping by as much as 2 percent earlier in the day.

Aeromexico, a member of the SkyTeam alliance, operates more than 600 flights daily to destinations in Mexico, the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe and Asia.

Forty-three people died in the collapse of the bridge in the northern city of Genoa, a major test for Italy's new government. 
Autostrade, which runs 3000 km (2,500 miles) of toll roads across Italy, responded to Toninelli's remarks by saying it had spent more on repairs across its network than required under its concession.
The company, which is 88 percent owned by Benetton-controlled Atlantia, accounts for more than 60 percent of its parent firm's core earnings.
Toninelli said that the government was working on a decree, to be approved on Friday, that would assign the reconstruction of the bridge to a state-controlled company, probably Fincantieri, cutting off Autostrade.
""The collapse of the bridge was not due to a tragic accident, but to a lack of maintenance, which was up to Autostrade per l'Italia,"" he said in parliament.
Italy's daily La Stampa reported that the government was also working on another decree aimed at revoking Autostrade's whole motorway concession. Toninelli did not mention a second decree in his hearing.
In reply to Toninelli's remarks, Autostrade said it had spent 5.14 billion euros ($5.95 billion) on the upkeep of its whole road network between 2000 and 2017. It said this was more than it was required to spend, although it did not give further details about where or when the money was spent.
It said the total hours of maintenance on the bridge that collapsed were equivalent to five days a week of repairs between 2015 and 2018.

Bearing anti-Morales signs and dressed in colorful traditional clothing, TV images showed indigenous Maya protesting Morales’ decision not to renew the mandate of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) and to ban the group’s leader, Ivan Velasquez, from returning to the country.
Both measures have been harshly criticized by domestic and international observers as a step back in Guatemala’s fight against corruption. 
Indigenous activist Andrea Ixchiu wrote on Twitter that the protesters she was with were determined to stay until Morales took action. 
""We are here and we aren't leaving,"" she wrote.
Additional demonstrations were planned later in the day outside Congress in Guatemala City, with another march in the capital planned for Wednesday. 
In addition to the moves against the anti-graft body, protesters oppose two legislative initiatives: one due to be discussed in Congress on Tuesday that would give the legislature power to oversee the process of stripping politicians of their immunity and another that would permit almost 80 congressmen who have defected from the opposition to join Morales' party.
Critics say the combination of measures against the commission and the legislative initiatives are designed to protect Morales from legal proceedings in a corruption investigation. Morales says he is protecting the country's sovereignty.
""It is clear we are facing a clear plan by Congress to generate mechanisms of impunity,"" said Oswaldo Samayoa, a criminal law professor at Guatemala's San Carlos university.
In August, the nation’s Supreme Court decided to consider a request to strip Morales of his immunity for his alleged participation in illegal electoral financing. The proceeding, supported by CICIG, is the third against him. 
Formed in 2006 to help Guatemalan prosecutors break a cycle of impunity, CICIG is credited with improving the Central American country's justice system.
Morales’ predecessor is in prison and standing trial for allegedly running a customs racket uncovered by CICIG. Last year, the commission started investigating the current president’s family for alleged corruption and supported impeaching him.

Morales, a former comedian elected in 2015, denies any wrongdoing and says the CICIG has overstepped its remit.

Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), asked for the meeting after Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano last month accused the pope of knowing for years about sexual misconduct by former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick and of doing nothing about it.
The Vatican said in a statement the pope would meet on Thursday with DiNardo, Cardinal Sean Patrick O'Malley of Boston, and two USCCB officials.
In the 11-page statement published on Aug. 26, Vigano, the former Vatican ambassador to Washington, launched an unprecedented broadside by a Church insider against the pope and a long list of Vatican and U.S. Church officials.
DiNardo has said Vigano's accusations ""deserve answers that are conclusive and based on evidence"".
The accusations shook the U.S. Church, following a damning Grand Jury report in the state of Pennsylvania that found that 301 priests in the state had sexually abused minors over the past 70 years.

Di Nardo has called for the Vatican to help with an investigation into how McCarrick could have risen steadily through the ranks of the U.S. Church although many people knew that he had engaged for years in sexual misconduct with adult male seminarians.

Iran and Russia are President Bashar al-Assad's main backers in Syria's seven-year-old civil war. Last week, Russian and Syrian warplanes resumed a bombing campaign in Idlib, the last rebel enclave in Syria, after weeks of quiet, in an apparent prelude to a full-scale offensive.
""We are also worried. We are going to work toward that not happening,"" Ansari said as he arrived in Geneva for U.N. talks about setting up a Syrian constitutional committee. The talks are hosted by U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura and also include senior Russian and Turkish officials.
Idlib is the insurgents' only remaining major stronghold and a government offensive could be the war's last decisive battle.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said in an article in the Wall Street Journal that a Syrian government offensive in Idlib would cause humanitarian and security risks for Turkey, Europe and beyond.
Erdogan failed to secure a pledge for a ceasefire from Russia and Iran at a trilateral summit in Tehran.
U.S. President Donald Trump's national security adviser said on Monday the United States, Britain and France had agreed that another use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government would result in a ""much stronger response"" compared to previous Western air strikes there.
U.S. officials have said in recent days they have evidence that Syrian government forces are preparing chemical weapons ahead of a planned assault on Idlib.
""I am not going to tell the world ahead of time what we are going to do, it is just not my style,"" U.S. Defence Secretary Mattis told reporters in Washington on Tuesday. 
Trump has twice ordered U.S.-led strikes against targets in Syria in response to what Washington called the Assad government’s use of chemical weapons against civilians.

""The first time around (Assad) lost 17 percent of his pointy nosed air force airplanes. He's been warned and so we'll see if he's wised up,"" Mattis added.

But the White House did not immediately confirm the cancellation, saying it was still finalizing plans for Trump's November trip to Europe.
Trump announced in August that he would travel to Ireland as part of a trip to attend the Nov. 11 commemoration in Paris of the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War One. 
A number of groups announced they would stage protests during Trump's visit, in which the president had been expected to visit the capital Dublin and his golf resort in the west coast village of Doonbeg. 
""The proposed visit of the U.S. president is postponed,"" an Irish government spokesman told Reuters. ""The U.S. side has cited scheduling reasons.""
But White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders later told reporters that no final decision had been made. 
""The president will travel to Paris in November as previously announced. We are still finalizing whether Ireland will be a stop on that trip,"" Sanders said. ""As details are confirmed we will let you know.""
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who as a cabinet minister opposed extending an invitation to Trump before changing his mind when he became prime minister, had described the trip as coming ""a little bit out of the blue"", but said the office of the U.S. president must be respected.
Ireland's opposition Green Party, which had opposed the trip, described the announcement and following cancellation as ""erratic"".
""Trump’s positions and demeanor on every issue of the day, from climate to women’s rights, from international relations to political decency, represent the opposite of ... Irish values,"" Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said.

Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 but Serbia has still not recognized it as a sovereign state and relations between the two remain tense.
An agreement is a precondition for both countries to join the European Union. Belgrade and Pristina committed to an EU-sponsored dialogue in 2013 but little progress has been done.

The Coalition for Family civil groups, gathered 3 million signatures in 2016, seeking to hold a referendum to amend the constitutional wording to an union strictly between ""a man and a woman"", from the existing, gender neutral, ""spouses"".
A referendum could be held as early as on Oct. 7, the ruling party has said. The government is expected to set a date for the ballot over the coming days. 
The lower house of parliament voted to support the referendum last year. That move was slammed by LGBT and rights groups locally and internationally, and dozens of European parliament members, who fear an erosion of democratic rights.
Same sex marriage is legal or about to be legal in half of the European Union's 28 countries, with some others recognizing same-sex civil partnerships. 
The Romanian initiative, which cleared the upper house of parliament in a 107-13 vote, has backing from the main Orthodox church and minority Roman Catholic and Greek-Catholic denominations in the socially conservative state of 20 million.
Under Romanian law, the constitution can be changed after a proposal by the president, the government, a quarter of all lawmakers or at least 500,000 citizens. 
Parliament must endorse such requests, which must then be approved in a nationwide referendum to come into force.
Romania's civil code of rules for relations between citizens already bans same-sex civil partnerships. 

In June, the European Court of Justice ruled that European Union states which have not legalized gay marriage must still offer same-sex spouses residency rights equal to those of straight couples.

Turkish officials were not immediately available for comment on the matter. The Austrian Foreign Ministry said an Austrian citizen had been arrested in Ankara on Tuesday but declined to provide further details on data protection grounds.
Ties between Turkey and many European Union countries have been strained by a wave of arrests made as part of a security crackdown by President Tayyip Erdogan following a failed military coup in July 2016.
Foreign journalists have been among those arrested, including German-Turkish reporter Deniz Yucel, who was held for a year on alleged security-related offences and released in February.
Austria has been particularly critical of Turkey's crackdown. Conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who governs in coalition with the far right, has called for Turkey's EU accession talks to be broken off, though both countries have recently sought to mend relations.

1423,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>","Catalonia crisis could flare again, with political and economic fall-out","MADRID (Reuters) - At the height of the crisis over Catalonia's secession drive last year, thousands of companies moved their legal headquarters out of the region, the Madrid stock market and government bonds took a hit, and the Spanish state came under strong pressure.
Nearly a year later, the organizers of an illegal referendum on independence for Catalonia are in jail or in self-imposed exile, Spain has a new prime minister and the economy has stabilized.
But the situation remains tense and could flare up any time.
WHAT IS THE DANGER FOR THE ECONOMY?
Despite the crisis, Catalonia remains one of Spain's main economic powerhouses and still accounts for around a fifth of national gross domestic product.
However, a Catalan trade group says hotels in Barcelona have seen revenue fall 14 percent this summer after the city developed a negative reputation internationally, partly as a result of political instability.
Data also showed fewer new businesses were created in Catalonia and international investment had dropped, putting the region on track to fall behind Madrid in terms of economic output for the first time.
More than 3,000 firms have shifted their headquarters outside the region, many to Madrid. The risk is that the uncertainty over investments in Catalonia will translate into a slow economic decline.
WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON POLITICS?
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who ousted the conservative Mariano Rajoy in June, remains opposed to Catalonia becoming an independent state, something the Spanish constitution does not allow.
Sanchez has however adopted a softer tone and offered to hold a wide-ranging dialogue that could lead to drafting a new statute of autonomy that Catalans would have the opportunity to adopt or reject by referendum.
Catalonia's new leader, Quim Torra, last week dismissed the idea that this could be a way forward and instead called on Sanchez to accept a legally-binding referendum on independence.
Because Sanchez needs Torra's party votes in the national parliament to pass the annual budget bill, a failure to find common ground in Catalonia would likely spill over to national politics in Madrid - and possibly trigger a snap national election sometimes in early 2019.
WILL THE ISSUE GO AWAY?
According to a survey released in July 46.7 percent of Catalans want their region to become an independent state, while 44.9 percent oppose this solution.
The number of people who are in favor or against independence has remained roughly stable over the last four years, meaning the issue is unlikely to go away any time soon.

Catalonia also elected a new regional parliament this year in which separatist forces retained a majority of seats. The trials of jailed separatist leaders should keep the Catalan question at the top of the political agenda for the time being.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Burundi's ambassador in Geneva struggled to explain to the U.N. Human Rights Council on Tuesday why his government had thrown out a U.N. team that the Council, with Burundi's backing, had sent to investigate human rights abuses in the country.
Deputy Human Rights Commissioner Kate Gilmore told the Council that her office could not deliver a promised report on human rights in Burundi because the government had not cooperated with the expert team, who were deployed in March and told their visas were canceled in April.
""It is a matter of concern that through its lack of cooperation Burundi has prevented implementation of this Council’s resolution and the mandated work of the group of experts,"" she said.
Burundi has been gripped by violence since early 2015 when President Pierre Nkurunziza said he would seek a third term, widely seen as a breach of the constitution. 
Subsequent clashes between security forces and rebels left hundreds dead and forced about half a million to flee, reviving memories of the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda, which has a similar ethnic mix.
Gilmore welcomed criticism of Burundi by European diplomats at the council, which she said showed ""the inappropriateness, the unacceptability of this paralysis"".
Burundian Ambassador Renovat Tabu said the departure of the U.N. team had been spun to cast his government in a bad light.
""Burundi regrets… the way in which events have been twisted in order to imply there has not been full cooperation,"" he said.
""Burundi is concerned by an unfair accusation which further entrenches the hostility which has been commonplace against Burundi for some time.""
He said former U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein had changed the U.N. team's mission, an ""irregularity"" which surprised Burundi's migration services, who declined to extend the team's visas. 
The agreement to send the experts to Burundi, based on a resolution submitted by the African group of countries at the Council last year, was widely seen as a diplomatic ploy to derail a more heavyweight Commission of Inquiry.
But the attempt failed, and the Council ended up sending both, leaving Burundi facing double scrutiny and with a public commitment to cooperate with investigators. 
Last week the Commission of Inquiry said crimes against humanity were still being committed in Burundi, whipped up by rhetoric from top officials including Nkurunziza. Burundi called the accusations ""lies"".

The Commission is seeking a renewal of its mandate from the 47-member Human Rights Council, which began a three-week session on Monday.

ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Campaigning began in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan on Tuesday for parliamentary elections that Kurds hope will help end months of turmoil, a year after the region of six million made a failed bid to break away from the rest of the country.
The mood was unusually subdued across the region as the two dynastic parties which dominate Kurdish politics held rallies in their respective strongholds in an attempt to whip up support for the Sept. 30 vote.
Massoud Barzani, who last year stepped down from the region's presidency but maintains a respected position within his Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), addressed a crowd in Erbil, the region's capital. Meanwhile, leaders of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) gathered in Sulaimaniya province. 
Iraqi Kurds will go to the polls to elect members of parliament for their region, which gained self-rule in 1991. Hundreds of candidates are vying for seats in the 111-seat house. The current parliament was elected in 2013. 
The start of campaigning had been delayed by a week, as Kurdish political parties debated delaying the regional vote over stalled negotiations in Baghdad. 
A federal election in May, which included Kurdish provinces, was inconclusive and no government has yet been formed. Kurds have traditionally fielded a candidate for the federal presidency. 
Kurds, who had enjoyed unprecedented autonomy for years, voted overwhelmingly for independence in the 2017 plebiscite, which was opposed by Baghdad and Iraq's neighboring countries, Turkey, Iran and Western powers. 
The vote prompted military and economic retaliation from Iraq’s central government in Baghdad, which took punitive measures to stamp out the region's independence aspirations, plunging the region into further economic and political turmoil. 
Relations between Kurdish regional and central Iraqi authorities have since improved, but negotiations have stalled over oil exports and revenue-sharing.
""Had not it been for the KDP, Erbil would be ruled by others,"" Barzani told the rally in Erbil, in a reference to territories lost to federal Iraqi forces following the referendum. ""To have a strong Kurdistan we need a strong KDP.""

Opposition parties have expressed concern for months that turnout would be affected by fallout from May's national election which was marred by allegations of fraud in Kurdish areas. At least one opposition party was boycotting the election.

Xi made the comments at a news conference in Vladivostok in Russia's far east after holding talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of an economic forum. 
Xi, whose country is locked in an escalating trade showdown with the United States, did not mention Washington by name but his comments made it clear he was referring to the U.S. and what Moscow and Beijing regarded as its unacceptable unilateralism. 
""In a rapidly changing international situation with growing instability and unpredictability, cooperation between Russia and China takes on even more importance,"" said Xi, according to a transcript on the Kremlin's website.

The Hague-based court said it was an independent and impartial institution with the backing of 123 countries.
""The ICC, as a court of law, will continue to do its work undeterred, in accordance with those principles and the overarching idea of the rule of law,"" it said in a statement. 
ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said last year there was a “reasonable basis to believe” war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed in Afghanistan and that all sides in the conflict would be examined, including members of the U.S. armed forces and Central Intelligence Agency.
Bolton said on Monday that if such an investigation was launched, the Trump administration would consider banning ICC judges and prosecutors from entering the United States, sanctioning funds they have there and prosecuting them in U.S. courts.
The United States did not ratify the Rome treaty that established the ICC during the presidency of Republican George W. Bush. Instead, it adopted the American Services-Members' Protection Act, nicknamed the Hague Invasion Act because it authorized the use of any means necessary to free U.S. personnel held by the court.
France, a major advocate of the ICC, said the institution should be left to do its work without hindrance.
""France, with its European partners, supports the International Criminal Court, both in its budgetary contribution and in its cooperation with it,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said in a statement.

""The court must be able to act and exercise its prerogatives without hindrance, independently and impartially, within the legal framework defined by the Rome Statute,"" it said.

1429,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 12:03PM ET</span>",Dozens killed and injured in suicide attack at Afghan protest,"By Abdul Qadir Sediqi and Ahmad Sultan
KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber in Afghanistan killed at least 32 people and wounded more than 120 at a demonstration on Tuesday on the highway between the eastern city of Jalalabad and the main border crossing into neighboring Pakistan, officials said.
Officials and elders said Tuesday's attack targeted a gathering to protest against a police commander.
The blast scattered the crowd numbering hundreds of people, but more gathered after the explosion to continue the protest. The details of the complaint against the police chief were not immediately clear.
The bombing, less than a week after a suicide attack killed more than 20 people in the capital Kabul, took place as violence has flared across the nation, with heavy fighting in northern provinces.
Officials have said violence is likely to intensify before parliamentary elections next month and a presidential election in April.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The Taliban denied involvement.
Attaullah Khogyani, spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar, said 32 people were dead and 128 were wounded in the blast but Sohrab Qaderi, a member of the Nangarhar provincial council, said at least 56 bodies were taken to hospital, with 43 more wounded. That higher death toll was not confirmed.
""I feel profound indignation at this latest wave of attacks deliberately targeting civilians,"" said Tadamichi Yamamoto, the senior United Nations official in Afghanistan in a statement. ""The planners must face justice.""
The escalating violence has dampened hopes of peace talks to end Afghanistan's 17-year conflict but two Taliban officials on Tuesday told Reuters the movement was preparing for another meeting with U.S. officials following one in July.
Nangarhar, one of the main strongholds of Islamic State militant fighters since early 2015, has been one of the most volatile regions this year, with a string of suicide bombings and attacks on its capital, Jalalabad.
The explosion at the protest followed a series of smaller blasts on Tuesday that targeted schools in Jalalabad and surrounding districts that were returning after summer breaks.
A 12-year-old boy was killed and several children and adults were wounded by a secondary blast that hit first responders and families rushing to the scene of the explosion.
In the northern province of Sar-e Pul, hundreds of armed men assembled to boost the city's defenses as security forces fought to push the Taliban back from the city center, said Zabihullah Amani, the provincial governor's spokesman.
U.S. air forces have conducted a number of strikes in northern Afghanistan as the fighting has picked up in recent days, with three strikes in Sar-e Pul on Monday, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan said.
In addition, two air strikes were carried out in Baghlan, another northern province on Tuesday, following six the day before and U.S. advisers were on the ground supporting Afghan troops, the spokesman added.

Ghulam Mohammad Balkhi, deputy spokesman for the Afghan army's 209 Corps, said at least 30 Taliban fighters were killed in the joint operation.

KHAN AL-AHMAR, West Bank (Reuters) - When the residents of Khan al-Ahmar awoke on Tuesday morning, they were greeted by the sight of five brand new shacks on the outskirts of their village, a cluster of tumbledown huts on a desert hillside in the occupied West Bank.
The structures are the work of dozens of Palestinian activists who have come to protest against Israel's plan to demolish Khan al-Ahmar and relocate its 180 residents - Bedouins who scrape a living by raising sheep and goats - to a site 12 km (7 miles) away.
Organized by activists from several rights groups and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, the protest action comes a day before a temporary injunction that had put the demolition on hold is due to expire.
""We are just waiting to see if they are going to come tonight and expel us and demolish the houses,"" said Feisal Abu Dahok, 45, a resident of the village.
""We will not leave voluntarily. If they throw us out we will return to stay in this place. There is no other place for us to go.""
Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Britain have followed the European Union and the United Nations in urging Israel not to demolish Khan al-Ahmar, citing the serious impact on the community and prospects for peace.
But last week Israel's Supreme Court rejected petitions to prevent the move, siding with the authorities which say the village was built without the required permits. Palestinians say such documents are impossible to obtain.
PALESTINIAN APPEAL TO ICC
The Palestinian leadership has submitted an appeal to the International Criminal Court to intervene, senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said on Tuesday. 
""It included the focus on the war crimes facing Khan al-Ahmar, specifically the crimes of forceable displacement, ethnic cleansing and destruction of civilian property,"" Erekat told reporters.
Khan al-Ahmar lies beside an Israeli highway that runs through the West Bank from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea. 
Palestinians say the demolition is part of an Israeli push to create an arc of settlements that would effectively cut off East Jerusalem from the West Bank, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and which the Palestinians seek for an independent state.
Israel has not said whether it plans to build a settlement on the site after demolition. Most countries consider settlements in the West Bank as illegal and an obstacle to peace. They say they reduce and fragment the territory Palestinians seek for a viable state.
Israel disputes this and cites biblical, historical and political connections to the land, as well as security needs.
Home to members of the Bedouin Jahalin tribe, which the military expelled from southern Israel in the 1950s, Khan al-Ahmar sits between a major Israeli settlement, Maale Adumim, and a smaller one to the northeast, Kfar Adumim.
Visible on the hills on the other side of a barren, rock-strewn valley, Kfar Adumim's white-washed apartment blocks and tree-lined roads lie in stark contrast to the ramshackle wood and tin huts of the Bedouins. 
Israel plans to relocate the community to an area near the Palestinian village of Abu Dis. The new site is adjacent to a landfill and rights advocates say that a forcible transfer of the residents would violate international law applying to occupied territory.
Israeli authorities could not be reached for comment on Tuesday - the second day of the Jewish new year holiday.
Helped by some of the villagers and working quickly under the cover of darkness, the activists assembled the shacks in time for sunrise. Some were flying the Palestinian flag. 

""It is our right as Palestinians to live in these lands,"" said one protester, Mohammed al-Khatib.

Evidence from communications intercepts has pointed to Moscow's involvement during the investigation involving the FBI, CIA and other agencies, NBC reported, citing three unidentified U.S. officials and two other people briefed on the probe. 
The evidence, however, is not conclusive enough for the United States to assign blame publicly to Moscow, according to the NBC report.
The FBI said it did not have a comment on the NBC report. A U.S. government source familiar with official assessments said intelligence agencies would not confirm the report.
U.S. officials said in July that they are still investigating health problems at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba, and do not know who or what was behind the mysterious illnesses, which began in 2016 and have affected 26 Americans.
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told Reuters on Tuesday, ""We have made no determination on who or what is responsible for the health attacks."" 
Symptoms have included hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, headaches and fatigue, a pattern consistent with ""mild traumatic brain injury,"" State Department officials have said.
The State Department said in June it brought a group of diplomats home from Guangzhou, China, over concern they were suffering from a mysterious malady resembling brain injury.
Cuban officials, who are conducting their own investigation, have denied involvement.
The United States believes sophisticated electromagnetic weapons may have been used on government workers, possibly in conjunction with other technologies, NBC reported. 
The U.S. military has been trying to reverse-engineer the weapon or weapons used to harm the diplomats, including by testing various devices on animals, NBC said, citing Trump administration officials, congressional aides and others.

Part of the work is being done at the directed energy research program at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, where the military has giant lasers and laboratories to test high-power electromagnetic weapons, including microwaves, NBC said.

However, a junior minister warned the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) that any attempt to undermine the government's legitimacy would be dealt with mercilessly.
Chamisa, who heads the MDC, has argued that he was cheated of victory by the electoral board, and has rejected last month's constitutional court ruling that declared Mnangagwa winner of the presidential vote in July.
Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga took a symbolic presidential oath in a direct challenge to President Uhuru Kenyatta in January.
The Zimbabwean opposition insisted it will respect legal limits as it draws attention to its cause on Saturday when the MDC celebrates 19 years since its formation at a local stadium.
""We will do everything that resembles an inauguration but everything will be within the law,"" Chamisa's spokesman Nkululeko Sibanda said, adding that the MDC was still discussing how the event would be conducted.
If the 40-year-old Chamisa proceeds with the mock inauguration, it could be seen as challenging Mnangagwa, who has called on opponents to rally behind his leadership to rebuild the country's struggling economy.
Chamisa has also promised to stage peaceful street protests to put pressure on Mnangagwa, whom he has refused to recognize and says lacks legitimacy.
Deputy minister of information and publicity Energy Mutodi said the government was following the opposition's plans with keen interest.
""Any attempt to delegitimize government will not be tolerated and those bent on causing anarchy will be dealt with mercilessly,"" Mutodi wrote on his official Twitter page.
Zimbabwe's first election since Robert Mugabe was removed in a de facto coup last November had been expected to end a history of disputed votes. Instead it re-enforced bitter divisions in the country.

Although the run-up to voting was peaceful, violence broke out when opposition supporters protested against the ruling ZANU-PF party's victory, leading to an army crackdown in which six people died. Mnangagwa has set up a team to investigate the killings.

A ban on women driving was lifted in June as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's bid to transform the economy of the world's top oil exporter and open up its cloistered society. Many automobile manufacturers celebrated the decision with advertising campaigns.
But the lifting of the ban was accompanied by fresh arrests of some of the very female activists who campaigned against it for years, including Loujain al-Hathloul, Aziza al-Yousef, Eman al-Nafjan, Nouf Abdelaziz, Mayaa al-Zahrani, Hatoon al-Fassi, Samar Badawi, Nassema al-Sadah and Amal al-Harbi.
Saudi authorities have accused them of suspicious contacts with ""foreign entities"", and local media labeled them traitors. At least nine people remain in detention, according to New York-based Human Rights Watch.
HRW said it had launched the #StandwithSaudiFeminists campaign after contacting Nissan, Jaguar Land Rover, Hyundai, Ford, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Audi, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) to urge them to act on behalf of the jailed women.
""The companies should speak out for these women who are unjustly behind bars awaiting trial and whose years of activism have created a lucrative new market for the car companies,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at HRW.

LONDON (Reuters) - Mark Carney will stay on as Bank of England governor until the end of January 2020 to help navigate the turbulence of Brexit, Britain's finance minister said on Tuesday, as he warned time was running out to secure a deal with the EU on future ties.
The United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29, but no agreement has been reached on the terms of its exit. Rivals to Prime Minister Theresa May are circling and some lawmakers are pushing for a rerun of the 2016 referendum.
Finance minister Philip Hammond said the government was devoting all its efforts to securing a deal on a new relationship with the EU. Carney's continued presence at the central bank will help Britain negotiate the aftermath, he said.
""I have been discussing with the governor his ability to be able to serve a little longer in post in order to ensure continuity through what could be quite a turbulent period for our economy in the early summer of 2019,"" Hammond said.
Carney, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker, has run the Bank of England since 2013. He gained respect from investors for his handling of the effects of the 2016 Brexit vote.
Since the shock vote to leave, companies have spent millions of pounds to prepare for Brexit. Many chief executives fear Britain could still leave without a deal, a scenario they warn would spook financial markets and silt up the arteries of trade.
Sterling, which tumbled after the 2016 vote, has recently been moving sharply on Brexit news. It reached its highest level since early August on Tuesday amid increased hopes for a deal, but then gave up its gains to stand at $1.3002.
As May tries to clinch a deal with Brussels, she is facing rebels in her Conservative Party who say they will vote down any deal that fails to deliver a sharp break with the EU. 
Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, said on Monday that a Brexit deal was possible ""within six or eight weeks"" if negotiators were realistic in their demands.
BREXIT DEAL?
Hammond warned that time was running out. 
""We are working against the clock, we understand that,"" Hammond told parliament. ""We will be working flat out over the coming weeks and months to achieve (a deal).""
May's spokesman said she saw an informal EU summit in the Austrian city of Salzburg next week as a ""staging post"" in Brexit negotiations that would allow EU leaders to discuss her proposals for the first time.
But business chiefs are worried.
The wrong Brexit deal could cost tens of thousands of jobs in the British car industry, the boss of Jaguar Land Rover said, adding he had no idea whether his plants would be able to operate in Britain after March 29.
""Currently I do not even know if any of our manufacturing facilities in the UK will be able to function on the 30th,"" Ralf Speth said.
He added that the company would not be able to build cars if customs checks meant that the motorway to and from the southern English port of Dover, which is used to transport components, becomes a ""car park"" due to snarl-ups.
Under May's proposals, Britain will seek a free-trade area for goods with the EU and accept a ""common rulebook"" for goods. Rebels say that will keep the UK under the EU's sway for years. 
At a presentation by economists who favor Britain's leaving without a deal, Conservative lawmakers who support Brexit warned that May would have to ensure Britain was independent of the EU after Brexit. 
Any joint EU-UK political statement, lawmaker Steve Baker said, would have to ""point towards an advanced free-trade agreement which leaves us as an independent country"".

Boris Johnson, May's former foreign minister and a leading Brexit-supporting rebel, said Britain should not accept EU single market legislation.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A close ally of President Vladimir Putin threatened Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny with violence on Tuesday, challenging him to a duel for making what he described as libelous and insulting corruption accusations. 
Viktor Zolotov, the head of Russia's National Guard, accused the jailed opposition leader of being a puppet of Washington and said his aim was to destabilize Russia.
Zolotov appeared visibly angry in the almost seven-minute clip aired online as he rejected allegations made by Navalny about graft in the National Guard.
""I simply challenge you to a fight - in the ring, on the tatami, whatever, and I promise to make nice, juicy mincemeat of you in a few minutes,"" the uniformed Zolotov said, raising his fist. 
Navalny is currently serving a 30-day jail sentence after a court convicted him last month of breaking protest laws, a move he said was designed by the authorities to stop him leading protests against pension reform across the country on Sunday.
Lyubov Sobol, a lawyer at Navalny's anti-corruption foundation, said it stood by the allegations and was ready to defend them in court if necessary.
Navalny was unable to respond because he was in jail, she said, but would decide whether to respond personally to Zolotov or not later.
Leonid Volkov, another Navalny ally, said he was concerned by threats in the video.
""Towards the end there are...very serious and open threats,"" wrote Volkov. ""It's not just funny, it's highly unpleasant."" 
Zolotov addressed the opposition leader in the video as ""Mr Navalny"" several times in a departure from most senior Russian officials, including Putin, who have pointedly avoided referring to him by name.
Navalny, who was barred from taking part in the March presidential elections and is broadly ignored by state television, has sought to carve out a following online publishing investigations into alleged official corruption. 
""I want to tell you that the statements you've made about me are insulting, slanderous and false. And it is not a custom to forgive such things among officers,"" said Zolotov, who has headed the National Guard since it was set up Putin in 2016.
Zolotov warned Navalny against making further allegations about him or his family. 
""I promise you that before stepping over you and wiping my feet, I will put on a demonstrative show for all the members of the National Guard. And I can guarantee you will be ashamed to go outside after that,"" he said. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the video did not constitute a physical threat to Navalny and he appeared to partially condone it.

""Sometimes, you can fight brazen slander by any means,"" said Peskov.

1437,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",Poland signals seven judges must quit in court overhaul,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's President Andrzej Duda signaled on Tuesday that seven Supreme Court judges seeking to work past retirement age would have to stand down, advancing reforms that critics have said amount to political interference in the judiciary.
A decision by Duda to allow five out of 12 Supreme Court judges who wanted to stay on to keep their posts meant in effect that the remaining seven could no longer sit there, Presidential aide Pawel Mucha told state news agency PAP. 
The measure is part of reforms by Poland's ruling nationalists that are under fire from the opposition, the European Union, and rights groups who say the overhaul undermines the rule of law in the largest ex-communist EU state. 
Through legislation and personnel changes, PiS has already taken de facto control of much of the judicial system since being elected in 2015, including the constitutional court and prosecutors, who now report directly to the justice minister.
The government says the change is needed to improve the efficiency of the courts and rid the country of a residue of communism, which collapsed in Poland almost 30 years ago. Further negotiations are due to take place with Brussels but so far Warsaw has offered only cosmetic concessions.
Earlier this year the Law and Justice (PiS) party introduced a law forcing into early retirement more than a third of the judges at the Supreme Court, which validates election results in Poland. New ones would be appointed by the president, a PiS ally.
There are more than 50 judges who are - according to the PiS-imposed law - allowed now to rule in the top court, after Duda's decision on Tuesday to allow the five judges to stay on.
Taking another step in a row that divided Poles, Duda had been expected to name on Tuesday a new acting head of the Court, a move likely to be seen by critics as an attempt to pressure President of the Supreme Court Malgorzata Gersdorf, who declares that she remains in her job on the basis of the constitution.
Gersdorf has defied a new law that forces her into early retirement and has called on the EU to defend her country's judiciary from government interference. 
""Mr. President will take this decision by midnight today,"" Duda spokesman Blazej Spychalski told private radio RMF FM.
However, Mucha later said the president would not name a new head of the court, adding that in his view this would mean that the longest-serving head of the Supreme Court chamber, Dariusz Zawistowski, 59, would become acting head of the Supreme Court.
The opposition has accused Duda of creating chaos aimed at helping PiS to take over the Supreme Court, as it did the Constitutional Tribunal in 2016.
""It is not about improving the speed and quality of cases being judged, because the main aim of what PiS is doing is to block the Supreme Court and install duplicate judges there,"" Borys Budka, opposition Civic Platform (PO) party deputy told private broadcaster TVN24.
The Supreme Court has ruled that any changes in the body should be put on hold until the European Court of Justice (ECJ) answers its question whether the way Poland nominates members of the body that recommends judges is in line with the EU law, but PiS regarded this decision as not valid.

The EU has launched a punitive procedure against Warsaw over the reforms, which the ruling party says are needed to free the judiciary of communist-era thinking and practices.

Its report examined five cases, including that of Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, found guilty last week of breaching the law on state secrets and sentenced to seven years in prison after investigating a massacre of 10 Rohingya men.
The U.N. report called it a ""particularly outrageous and high-profile example of judicial harassment against the media in Myanmar"" and illustrative of how arrests and prosecutions are conducted ""in violation of the right to freedom of expression"".
Myanmar has said the court that convicted the two Reuters journalists under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act was independent and followed due process, after international calls for the pair to be released.
Ministry of Information spokesman Myint Kyaw declined to comment on the report when reached by Reuters on Tuesday. Yangon officials have rejected claims that press freedom was shrinking under the administration of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kui.
""The report refers to the 'instrumentalization of the law and of the courts by the Government and the military in what constitutes a political campaign against independent journalism',"" U.N. human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told a Geneva briefing.
Laws on telecommunications, official secrets and import-export acts have been invoked against journalists, she said.
The group Reporters Without Borders estimates that around 20 journalists were prosecuted last year in Myanmar, Shamdasani said.

1440,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 10:30AM ET</span>",Former Nigerian leader Obasanjo urges West African governments to decriminalize drugs,"By Aaron Ross
DAKAR (Reuters) - West African governments should overhaul their drug laws to decriminalize personal use and prioritize treatment as a response to rising substance abuse in the region, former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo said on Tuesday. 
In an interview before he was due to present a model drug law to regional officials in Senegal, Obasanjo urged authorities to channel resources into fighting large-scale trafficking, which he said was undermining regional democracy. 
The use of substances like cocaine, heroin and amphetamines is rising in West Africa despite strict drugs laws. Countries that once served primarily as transit points for trade between South America and Europe are now active consumer markets. 
""All of us in West Africa know now that drugs are not just in transit through our countries. Our youth are becoming more and more consumers, even some form of drugs are being produced,"" Obasanjo said.
In 2016, the last year for which data was available, Africa registered the second-highest growth in cocaine seizures behind Asia, according to the United Nations. Abuse of opioids, particularly the cheap painkiller Tramadol, has become a major health crisis in Nigeria and neighboring countries. 
The recommendations by Obasanjo's West Africa Commission on Drugs come as a number of countries look to decriminalize drug use, especially marijuana, after decades of enforcement appear to have done little to curb it. 
Canada legalized recreational marijuana in June and most U.S. states have legalized the drug for medical or recreational use. Prominent political figures have also called for decriminalization in Mexico and Brazil in recent years.
""PRISON DOES NOT REFORM""
Obasanjo's commission has only an advisory role and it is up to national governments, often reluctant to scrap longstanding drug regulations, to decide whether to accept its proposals.
Obasanjo served twice as Nigeria's head of state: once as a military ruler in the 1970s and then again as a democratically-elected president from 1999-2007. Drug enforcement was strict during both his stints in office. 
But he cited his own encounters with drug offenders during a stint in Nigerian prison in the 1990s under the dictatorship of Sani Abacha as he urged governments to find alternatives to incarceration. 
""Prison does not reform. If anything it hardens,"" he said.
Obasanjo named Senegal and Ghana as two countries that are moving to expand treatment options. Senegal has since 2014 opened centers to treat addicts, while Ghana is considering a proposal to exempt first-time offenders from prison terms.
But criminal syndicates, human traffickers and jihadist groups are profiting from the drug trade, he said. In some cases, politicians in Nigeria and elsewhere are using the proceeds to finance political careers, he added.

""(I) fear that they may be creeping into our fledgling democracy and political life,"" Obasanjo said.

1441,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 10:25AM ET</span>",Palestinians say U.S. attacks international law with U.N. funding cuts,"By John Davison
CAIRO (Reuters) - Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki described on Tuesday President Donald Trump's decision to halt U.S. funding for the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA as an attack on international law.
Trump's decision has left UNRWA trying to cover a $200 million shortfall from Gulf and European donors, and has further strained tensions between Washington and the Palestinian leadership. 
Relations have sharply deteriorated since Trump decided to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital last year, reversing decades of U.S. policy and prompting Arab warnings that it could fuel crises in the region. Foreign governments and organizations, with exceptions including Israel, criticized the move.
""The U.S. administration has begun to attack the rights of the Palestinian people and international law,"" Maliki said at a meeting of the Arab League in Cairo, convened to discuss the issue.
Internationally-brokered peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have stalled since 2014 and Israeli settlements in the occupied territories have steadily expanded.
Palestinian leaders say their political situation has deteriorated since Trump took office in 2017 as Washington has pursued policies that favor the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is a close U.S. ally.
Netanyahu has broadly welcomed Trump's support. 
On Monday the United States also announced it would close the office of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in Washington for seeking to punish Israel through the International Criminal Court. 
Turkey, one of the strongest critics of Washington’s Middle East policy, said on Tuesday that the decision was a worrying step and ""another sign that the USA has lost its impartial stance on the Middle East peace process"". 
Washington said last month that it was halting all funding to UNRWA. Last week, Trump ordered that $25 million earmarked for the care of Palestinians in East Jerusalem hospitals be directed elsewhere as part of a review of aid.
The United States said UNRWA's business model and fiscal practices made it an ""irredeemably flawed operation"".
Jordan, a U.S. ally, said the decision would only fuel radicalism and harm prospects for Middle East peace.
Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said at the Arab League that Jordan would hold a meeting ""in cooperation with Sweden, Germany, Japan, the European Union and Turkey"" on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly later this month ""in an effort to get more aid"". 
Three Gulf States have announced a total of $150 million in funding for UNRWA this year, and other countries have made new or increased contributions as the agency scrambles to continue operating. 

""I humbly appeal to all of you to ensure the pledges that were made (to UNRWA) are indeed transferred,"" the head of UNRWA Pierre Krahenbuhl told Arab League delegates in Cairo. ""Please also consider opportunities for further donations at this critical time.""

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Catalan separatists began gathering in Barcelona on Tuesday to celebrate their region's commemorative day and boost its bid for independence, in an event expected to draw hundreds of thousands onto the city's streets.
Catalan leader Quim Torra and his predecessor Carles Puigdemont, who fled to Brussels in October after Madrid stripped him of office over his secessionist ambitions, have urged a big turnout to show continued support for a split from Spain.
""Our government has committed to making the republic a reality,"" Torra said on Monday in a televised address. ""Long live free Catalonia.""
Supporters of seceding the wealthy and politically divided northeastern region from the rest of the country have in recent years used the celebration of ""Diada"", the Sept. 11 anniversary of the fall of Barcelona to Spain in 1714, to promote their cause with mass demonstrations.
Just under a year ago, Puigdemont's pro-independence regional government held a referendum on independence, ruled unconstitutional by Madrid, followed by a unilateral declaration of independence.
A key motif at this year's event are yellow ribbons representing nine politicians and activists awaiting trial in jail for their role in that independence bid.
Their trials are expected to start later this year, a potential new source of tension as Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez tries to smooth relations with the region's current leaders. 
Socialist Sanchez, who took office in June, has taken a more conciliatory approach to the issue than his conservative predecessor Mariano Rajoy, who sacked Puigdemont and his government and imposed direct rule from Madrid. 
But Sanchez, like Rajoy, has stood firm against allowing a vote on secession, or any unilateral attempt by Catalonia to secede.
""It's very hard now because the Spanish government won't shift... They are offering nothing,"" said David Castiella, a 52-year-old salesman waiting in line to visit the medieval Barcelona palace where the regional government sits, opened to visitors free of charge every Sept. 11.
DEEP DIVISIONS
Parties favoring a split with Spain won most seats in regional elections that Rajoy convened in December in the hope of derailing the independence movement.
But divisions over the question of secession are stark in a region that makes up around one fifth of Spain's economic output and already has a high level of autonomy in areas including education and health, and its own police force.
A July poll showed 46.7 percent of Catalans saying they wanted an independent state while 44.9 percent did not. 
Albert Rivera, the fervently pro-unionist, Barcelona-born head of the Ciudadanos political party which won most votes in the December regional election, said the ""Diada"" should be a day of celebration for all Catalans.
""But the pro-independence lobby has taken it over and turned it into a day of exclusion, hatred and attack on Spain,"" he said on Twitter.
On Tuesday, tractors bearing huge yellow ribbons and red-and-yellow Catalan flags rolled into Barcelona from rural areas while yellow-hued banners bearing the faces of those in jail and the word 'Free' hung from city lamp posts.
Maria Angels Brugada, waiting for friends at a central square ahead of a march scheduled for the evening, said the prisoners and the politicians who fled into exile would set the mood for this year's celebration.

""There are many people who aren't here and are without their families,"" said the 61-year-old. ""It gives me goose pimples just talking about it.""

1444,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 09:54AM ET</span>","Ethiopia, Eritrea reopen border points for first time in 20 years","By Aaron Maasho
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea re-opened crossing points on their shared border for the first time in 20 years on Tuesday, cementing a stunning reconciliation and giving Addis Ababa a direct route to its former foe's Red Sea ports.
Ethiopian and Eritrean forces stationed along the border will be moved back to camps to ease tensions further, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said.
""We heralded the new year by demolishing the trenches along our border,"" Abiy told reporters, referring to the fact that Ethiopian New Year was celebrated on Tuesday.
""As of today, Ethiopia's defense forces (along the border with Eritrea) will be gathered to camps and ease tension that was often extreme. The same will be done from the Eritrean side.""
The war that broke out in 1998 over the border and other issues killed an estimated 80,000 people before fighting ended in 2000 in a contested peace deal. 
Tensions burned on over the position of the frontier - until Abiy offered to end the military standoff this year as part of a package of reforms that have reshaped the political landscape in the Horn of Africa and beyond. 
Thousands of people from both countries watched one border opening ceremony in Zalambessa, an Ethiopian border town that was reduced to rubble soon after hostilities between the neighbors started in 1998. 
Soldiers and civilians waving Ethiopian and Eritrean flags lined the road as Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki opened the frontier in a ceremony broadcast live on Ethiopian state TV.
""This is the happiest day of my life,"" Ruta Haddis, an Eritrean from the town of Senafe just across the frontier, told reporters. ""I never thought this would take place in my lifetime."" 
The two leaders opened another frontier crossing at Bure, Eritrea's Information Minister Yemane Meskel said in a tweet.
The Debay Sima - Bure crossing leads to the port of Assab in Eritrea's east, while its Massawa port is directly north of the Serha - Zalambessa connection.
Ethiopia, a rising economic power with 100 million people, had been almost entirely dependent on tiny neighbor Djibouti for access to the Red Sea since 1998. 
ETHIOPIAN NEW YEAR
Pictures posted online by Abiy's chief of staff showed the leaders talking and walking side by side in Bure - Abiy in camouflaged military fatigues and Isaias wearing sandals and a safari suit. 
Some of the fiercest fighting during the 1998-2000 war took place in the Bure region.
The Eritrean and Ethiopian leaders have moved swiftly to end two decades of hostility since signing a breakthrough agreement in Asmara on July 9 to restore ties.
Eritrea reopened its embassy in Ethiopia in July, Ethiopia reciprocated last week and the two countries have resumed flights.
The two leaders also celebrated Ethiopian New Year together at the border with their troops on Tuesday, Abiy's Chief of Staff, Fitsum Arega, said.

Ethiopia follows a calendar similar to the ancient Julian one - which started disappearing from the West in the 16th century - meaning the country entered its year 2011 on Tuesday.

Ramaphosa announced in late July that the ruling African National Congress (ANC) plans to change the constitution to allow the expropriation of land without compensation, as whites still own the majority of South Africa's land.
U.S. President Donald Trump waded into South Africa's high-octane land debate last month when he asked his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to study South African ""land and farm seizures"" in a late-night tweet.
Some analysts have since speculated that Trump's government could impose economic sanctions on South Africa to express its disapproval with the ANC's land reform agenda.
""We have no reason to believe that any country would impose sanctions on South Africa for any actions that we take, actions that are constitutional, that are lawful and consistent with international law,"" Ramaphosa said in parliament while answering a question from an opposition party on his government's land reform plans.

Ramaphosa added that the government was ready to discuss its land reform plans with any country. He repeated that land reform would follow a parliamentary process and that the government would not tolerate ""land grabs"".

1447,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",How the EU will vote and why it matters,"By Alastair Macdonald
STRASBOURG (Reuters) - An annual address to the European Parliament on Wednesday by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker puts a spotlight on EU elections next year.
WHO'S VOTING AND FOR WHAT?
More than 350 million adults in the European Union's 27 member states can vote, most on Sunday, May 26, 2019 -- two months after Britain becomes the first country to leave in a move that has spurred nationalist, anti-EU groups across Europe.
By proportional representation, they will elect 705 members to the European Parliament, which divides its time between Brussels and Strasbourg. Ranging from tiny Malta with 6 seats to Germany with 96, for five years these MEPs will check and amend laws proposed by the European Commission, subject to approval by national governments in the EU Council.
WHAT'S AT STAKE?
Campaign issues will range from spending, though the EU budget is equal to just 1 percent of member states' combined GDP, to climate change and labor rights. But some who want the Union broken up see it as a Brexit-style referendum on the EU's very survival, pitting advocates of historic, ethnic-based nations against the idea of pooling sovereignty to defend Europe's wealth and values in a world of rising authoritarian powers and global corporations. 
Caught up in this center-versus-states debate are refugees. Nationalists blame the EU for a surge in arrivals in 2015. Federalists say only cooperation can control migration.
Leaders of some eastern states such as Hungary and Poland slam Brussels over migrants and its complaints that they are undermining EU rules on democracy in Warsaw and Budapest; some westerners speak of cutting their EU subsidies in retaliation.
ARE THERE EU POLITICAL PARTIES?
Yes. And no. Eight party groups sit in the current 751-seat chamber, which is about to get smaller due to Brexit. The center-right European People's Party (EPP) has 29 percent and ensures an establishment majority by often cooperating with the center-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D -- 25 percent) and ALDE liberals (9 percent). Two right-wing anti-EU groups led by Britain's UKIP and France's National Rally share 10 percent.
But all the groups are unruly and EU elections are mainly contested by national parties on issues familiar to voters. 
DOES THE WINNER GET TO RUN THE EU?
Not really. Well, maybe. Parliament's leaders say they are the heart of European democracy. National leaders scoff at the 43 percent turnout in the 2014 EU elections. In practice, states wield most power and little happens that big countries don't like.
The EU executive Commission is led by Jean-Claude Juncker. A historic power struggle between Parliament and Council will get an airing in the election. Parliament has pledged to force the Council to nominate as Juncker's successor a lead candidate from a winning party in May's vote. National leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron say they won't be bound by that. That risks Parliament rejecting their Commission nominee, which would be an unprecedented crisis. 
I'M CONFUSED. SO WHO REALLY RUNS THE EU?
It's complicated. But the voting and lead candidate rumpus is part of horse-trading among governments to get compatriots or allies into top positions, not just in the Commission and Council but also the European Central Bank.
Germany and France, the two biggest states, have most clout but it's a game even the smallest can play. Juncker is the third EU chief executive from little Luxembourg -- though his hopes of states ceding more power to Brussels remain largely unrealized. 
AND SO WILL THE ELECTIONS CHANGE MUCH?
A push by eurosceptics could mean a bigger, more cohesive minority to disrupt EU legislation. But EU optimists also say a campaign that grabs more people's attention could reinvigorate post-Brexit efforts to pull the 27 together.

Polls suggest the far-right could increase its share but probably not enough to sound the death knell of the EU. It seems improbable that either camp, for or against closer integration in Europe, can land a knockout blow.

1448,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 09:12AM ET</span>",Wife of Pakistan's jailed ex-PM Nawaz Sharif dies in London,"By Asif Shahzad
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The cancer-stricken wife of Pakistan's jailed former prime minister Nawaz Sharif died in London on Tuesday while her husband and daughter were in prison, officials said.
Kulsoom Nawaz Sharif, 68, died after months in a coma. She was diagnosed with lymphoma last year, barely a month after Nawaz Sharif was removed from office by the Pakistan Supreme Court, which ordered him to face trial in an anti-corruption court. 
""The wife of Mian Nawaz Sharif is no more among us. May God rest her in peace,"" Shehbaz Sharif, the former prime minister's brother, said on Twitter.
New Prime Minister Imran Khan issued a statement offering condolences, and said the government ""as per law"" would provide assistance to the family.
""She was a courageous woman of great dignity and confronted her disease with fortitude,"" Khan said on Twitter.
It was not immediately clear whether Nawaz Sharif or his daughter, Maryam, might be released from prison to attend funeral services.
Nawaz Sharif was in London with Kulsoom earlier this year when the anti-corruption court handed him a 10-year jail term and sentenced his presumed political heir, Maryam, to seven years in prison over the purchase of luxury flats in London in the 1990s.
The father and daughter left her bedside to return to Pakistan to rally their followers ahead of July 25 elections, which their party lost to the former cricket star Imran Khan's party. Both were arrested on arrival and have been imprisoned since.
Kulsoom Sharif was briefly a member of parliament after she won her husband's former seat in a by-election after the Supreme Court disqualified him.
Three-time-premier Nawaz Sharif, who was removed from office in each of his elected terms, has maintained that his most recent ouster in July 2017 and subsequent conviction were part of a plot against him by the powerful military and the judiciary.
The army has repeatedly denied any interference in politics, while the courts insist justice is carried out impartially.
Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa expressed ""grief and heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family"", said the official military spokesman.
Up until her husband's ouster last year, Kulsoom Sharif had never been a politician, but she memorably led protests after the 1999 military coup that ended a previous Sharif administration.
With her husband jailed by General Pervez Musharraf, she broke through a police barricade set up around her home in Lahore in July 2000 in an attempt to prevent her from leading a public rally.
She managed to get away in a car, which was chased by the police for several miles. When police finally surrounded the car, she locked herself in for several hours in a standoff until police finally towed the vehicle away.

The Musharraf regime eventually allowed Nawaz and Kulsoom Sharif to leave the country, and they spent years in exile until returning in 2007 to contest new elections after Musharraf stepped down in the face of mass protests.

He made the comments as prosecutors presented closing arguments in the case before a United Nations-backed tribunal against four suspects accused of carrying out the attack that killed Hariri and 21 others.
""We have always wanted justice and have not resorted to revenge,"" Hariri, who attended the hearings, told journalists. He added that hearing about the assassination of his father in court was difficult as a son but he had to put his feelings aside.
""There are things that hurt, but when in a position of responsibility, we have to look at the country’s interest,"" he said.
Four alleged members of Iran-backed Hezbollah have been tried in absentia of planning and executing the bombing, which rocked the religiously divided country.
Wrapping up the prosecution case, Nigel Povoas said that Lebanon had been ""plunged into darkness and horror"" by the murder of its leader. The blast had been calculated ""to cause profound fear, terror and pain,"" he said.
The trial lasted more than four years during which 307 witnesses were called to substantiate allegations. The defendants, who remain at large, face a maximum sentence of life in prison.

The closing arguments will run until September 21. No date has been set for a verdict but it is expected next year.

The economic austerity pursued by European governments had fostered fear, racism and the emergence of the far right, he told lawmakers in the European parliament.
The firebrand leftist is a frequent critic of European governments but his comments carry fresh weight given Greece's emergence from a third European bailout and the rise of far right and populist parties in Germany and elsewhere.
""The EU's failure to give democratic and effective responses to modern challenges will lead irrevocably to the triumph of chauvinism and will rekindle nationalistic rivalry,"" he said.
""It will turn it into a fragmented continent, a continent without cohesion, without an international role, and without a future,"" he said.
Tsipras also criticized Europe's handling of security and said this could have helped bolster support for far right parties. Several European countries including France and Belgium have seen attacks by Islamist militants in recent years. 
""The issue at stake is existential for Europe,"" said Tsipras, who was elected in 2015. ""The handling so far of the financial crisis, the refugee crisis and a security crisis, has exposed huge deficiencies and contradictions.""
Greece is a gateway into the European Union for hundreds of thousands of refugees who have arrived since 2015 from Syria and other war-torn countries in the Middle East and from Africa.
""When other countries were unilaterally violating European decisions and raising fences, crisis-hit Greece resisted the sirens of hatred,"" he said from Strasbourg.
Greece's economic woes are part of a sovereign debt crisis that hit Europe starting in 2009 and also affected Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Cyprus.

Tsipras's comments came a day after regional authorities threatened to ban the operation of the country's biggest migrant camp next month unless authorities cleaned up ""uncontrollable amounts of waste"".

Major General Mohammad Baqeri was quoted three days after reports that Iran's Revolutionary Guards fired seven missiles at the base of an Iranian Kurdish armed opposition group in northern Iraq, killing at least 11 people.
""The government of Iraq and the Kurdistan authorities should not allow existence of such bases in their territories and should hand over these separatist terrorists to Iran,"" Baqeri said, according to Fars. 
""If they cannot hand them over, then they should expel them ... It is Iran's right to defend itself.""
Iranian missiles hit the headquarters of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), Iran's Revolutionary Guards said on Sunday in a statement.
The PDKI is an armed opposition group that fights for greater autonomy for Iran’s Kurdish community. Shi'ite Muslim-dominated Iran has up to 10 million Kurdish citizens who are mostly Sunni. Iran accuses its regional rival Saudi Arabia of funding Kurdish armed groups.
""Provoked by some regional countries and America ... these separatist terrorists carried out some operations inside Iran ... such measures are unacceptable for Iran,"" Baqeri said.
""The authorities of Iraq's Kurdistan had repeatedly tried to stop them but the group was provoked by others.""
The PDKI denies receiving Saudi support and says Kurds have been forced to take up arms because they have no alternative to secure their political rights. 
Riyadh in turn accuses Iran of stirring up trouble amongst the kingdom's own Shi’ite minority, a charge Iranian officials have denied.
Iran is involved in a proxy war with Sunni Saudi Arabia in the Middle East, where Tehran backs President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war, Houthi forces in Yemen's conflict and Lebanon's Hezbollah. 
Riyadh backed President Donald Trump's decision in May to pull the United States out from a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran and to reimpose sanctions on its arch-foe Tehran.

1458,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Pompeo said U.S. won't block Pakistan if it seeks IMF bailout: Pakistani minister,"By Asif Shahzad and Kay Johnson
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo assured Pakistan last week Washington would not try to block any request for a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Pakistani Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said on Tuesday.
The remarks, which Chaudhry said Pompeo made during his visit to Pakistan on Wednesday, come in stark contrast to Pompeo's warnings in July that the United States had serious reservations about the IMF giving money to Pakistan due to concerns Islamabad would use the cash to pay off Chinese loans.
Those comments rattled Islamabad, which is facing a currency crisis and may have no option but to turn again to the IMF for a rescue if staunch allies China and Saudi Arabia do not offer more loans to prop up its foreign currency reserves.
Chaudhry told Reuters that relations between United States and Pakistan were ""broken"" before Pompeo's trip to Islamabad but the visit had ""set many things straight"" and re-invigorated ties.
""He assured Pakistan that...if Pakistan opted to go to IMF for any financial help, the USA will not oppose it,"" Chaudhry said in the capital, Islamabad.
The U.S. embassy in Islamabad did not have any immediate comment.
The new government of Prime Minister Imran Khan, who took office in August, is trying to avert a currency crisis caused by a shortage of dollars in an economy hit by a ballooning current account deficit and dwindling foreign currency reserves.
Pakistani officials say they are discussing taking drastic measures to avert seeking a bailout from the IMF, which has come to Pakistan's rescue 14 times since 1980, including most recently in 2013.
Pakistan's relations with the United States have soured in recent years over the war in Afghanistan and Islamabad's alleged support for Islamist militants. Ties dropped to a new low when President Donald Trump in January accused Pakistan of lies and deceit by playing a double game on fighting terrorism.
Islamabad denies aiding insurgents in Afghanistan and lashed out against Trump's remarks, which were followed up by Washington suspending U.S. military aid.
At the United States' urging, a group of Western countries in February convinced a global body to put Pakistan on a terrorism financing watch list, a move that triggered concerns the United States may also seek to block Islamabad in other forums. 
In July, Pompeo said there was ""no rationale"" for the IMF to bail out Pakistan. Pompeo's worries that Islamabad would use the IMF money to pay off Chinese loans echoes concerns by other U.S. officials that China is saddling many emerging market countries with too much debt. Beijing staunchly denies such claims.
""There's no rationale for IMF tax dollars, and associated with that American dollars that are part of the IMF funding, for those to go to bail out Chinese bondholders or China itself,"" Pompeo said in July, referring to a possible Pakistan bailout.

But during last week's visit Pompeo said he was hopeful of ""a reset of relations"" long strained over the war in Afghanistan.

1459,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 11, 2018 06:21AM ET</span>",Austrian conservatives will back EU motion against Hungary,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian conservatives in the European Parliament will vote in favor of a motion finding that Hungary has persistently breached the European Union's values, Austria's conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said late on Monday.
The decision is unusual for Kurz given his close ties to Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a fellow immigration hard-liner. Kurz has said he hopes to use those ties to build bridges between western EU member states and eastern ones that have clashed over immigration and other issues.
Austria's five conservatives are a tiny fraction of the two-thirds of votes needed in the 750-seat assembly for the so-called Article 7 procedure to pass. That would set in motion a process that could lead to sanctions such as a suspension of Hungary's voting rights.
""The Austrian (conservative) lawmakers will vote in favor because we believe that there can be no compromises on the rule of law and democracy and it is therefore important that the accusations that have been made against Hungary are cleared up,"" Kurz told ORF television.
Kurz's People's Party is in the same conservative bloc in the European Parliament as Orban's Fidesz. Austria also holds the rotating presidency of the European Union until the end of the year.
Orban was due to address the European Parliament on Tuesday ahead of a vote on the Article 7 procedure later this week.
His Fidesz party won a parliamentary election last April by a landslide, buoyed by migration policies including a refusal to take any resettled asylum seekers from the Middle East and North Africa after a wave of arrivals in Europe that began in 2015.
Orban has put pressure on courts, media and non-government groups since he came to power in 2010. Though the EU has often protested, it has largely failed to stop him in what his critics denounce as a growing authoritarian drive.
Kurz, however, appeared to suggest that other Eastern European countries should also face an Article 7 procedure. 
""It is ... not only necessary to take a closer look at Hungary but also when we look at the situation in Poland, in Hungary, in Romania, in Slovakia, where there was recently a murder of a journalist, there too it is necessary to look very closely,"" he said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - As Indians' anger grows over record fuel prices, the ruling party is getting advice on social media to seek lessons in mathematics and graphic design after it posted a bar-chart graphic that showed fuel prices lower than in prior years.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is facing criticism for not doing enough to cut fuel taxes that account for more than a third of retail petrol and diesel prices, which have soared to record highs this month.
Twitter users on Tuesday derided Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the graphic, which showed the price of petrol in New Delhi, the capital, at 80.7 rupees a liter, while using an arrow showing a drop of 13 percent, rather than a rise, to compare it to a price of 71.4 rupees four years ago. (https:// Titled ""Truth of Hike"", the graphic included Modi's picture and used four bars to show petrol price rises since 2004, but represented the current, higher price with a smaller bar.  The post was retweeted 2,100 times, attracted 3,200 comments and figured on primetime news shows after it was posted late on Monday, becoming the butt of jokes on social media, with some users questioning how 80 rupees could be less than 70.  Amit Malviya, the chief of the BJP's information technology cell, said the graphic was not being interpreted correctly and was aimed only at showing that the 13 percent increase since 2014 was lower than in previous years. ""It may sound paradoxical, but that is what it is,"" Malviya told Reuters. Twitter users were unconvinced. Zaineb Hakim joked on the social network, ""Based on this graph, you are all entitled to a full refund from the mathematics department of the school you graduated from, assuming you did attend one.""  Another user, Jas Oberoi, wrote, ""Modiji needs to spend taxpayers' money on a better infographic provider. This is outrageous,"" referring to the prime minister with a honorific suffix. Past governments have usually cut fuel taxes when international oil prices shot up, but Modi's administration has so far blamed global factors, such as Turkey's economic crisis. The fuel price hike has also furnished ammunition for the opposition Congress party to criticize Modi ahead of general elections next year. On Monday, protests against the high prices shut down many businesses, government offices and schools. 
The Congress countered the BJP's graphic with its own, showing a crying Bollywood actor looking at the graphic and retweeting inverted versions of the BJP chart. (https://

Spiric, a former prime minister of Bosnia, is a member of the Serb Republic's ruling SNSD party, led by Bosnian Serb nationalist Milorad Dodik, who was also sanctioned by the U.S. in 2016 for obstructing the Balkan country's peace process.
Following its war in the 1990s, Bosnia was split in two autonomous regions, the Serb Republic and the Federation dominated by Muslim Bosniaks and Croats, linked via a weak central government.
""Mr. Spiric engaged in and benefited from public corruption, including the acceptance of improper benefits in exchange for the performance of public functions and interference with public processes, during his tenure as a member of the House of Representatives in Bosnia and Herzegovina,"" the State Department said in a statement late on Monday. 
The sanctions imposed under Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Act of 2018, enable the U.S. to ban Spiric and his family members from entering the United States, according to the statement. 
Spiric, who has been investigated for corruption by state prosecutors but never indicted, has dismissed the graft allegations.
He was not immediately available for comment on Tuesday but in a statement to Bosnian Serb news agency Srna he said he had no reason to feel guilty.
""I have always answered to my people and was always at the disposal of all investigative and judicial institutions in my country,"" he said. 
Dodik accused the outgoing U.S. Ambassador in Bosnia, Maureen Cormack, of being behind the move in a bid to undermine SNSD officials ahead of the elections on Oct. 7.
Last month Dodik accused the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo of using its development agency to interfere in the Balkan country's election process, a charge dismissed by the embassy as a ""wild"" conspiracy theory.

Reports from the U.N. and aid charities described farmers lacking seeds to sow following crop failures in some areas and livestock dying for the want of anything to eat.
Afghanistan, a country where nearly 20 million people rely on farming, has suffered a 45 per cent fall in agricultural output this year as the drought has bitten, officials at the ministry of agriculture have said.
In a regular update, the U.N. humanitarian office reported that 120,000 people fleeing the drought arrived in Qala-e-Naw city in Badghis province in the week to Sept. 9. 
A second U.N. report, with data covering August, said more than 100,000 people may have moved to Herat city for the same reason by the end of last month. It estimated 2.2 million Afghans would be affected by the drought this year.
In Qala-e-Naw, where there are an estimated 66,500 drought-displaced people, supplies and humanitarian aid are already insufficient to meet the needs of newly arrived families.
The U.N. cited an assessment by aid charity World Vision International that 99 percent of people in Badghis said their food situation was worse or a lot worse than a year ago.
""The assessment also indicates that most farmers lost last season's harvest and nearly all of them lack seeds for new planting season,"" the U.N. report said, noting reports that about 40 per cent of livestock has been lost in Badghis due to a lack of pasture and fodder. 
The Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET), a U.S. funded food security monitoring service, said in a report on Aug. 31 that the number of Afghans in a food ""crisis"" was atypically high. 
""Crisis"" is step three on a five step scale, where four is ""emergency"" and five is ""catastrophe"" and possible famine.
In Badghis and Faryab provinces, emergency outcomes are expected to emerge in January, FEWS NET said.
""Normally during this time period, food security outcomes begin to seasonally improve in much of the country, but due to drought and severe reduction in wheat production, reduced labor opportunities, and continued conflict more households face Crisis outcomes than normal,"" it said.

CURITIBA, Brazil (Reuters) - Jailed former Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will throw in the towel on Tuesday in his legal battle to run in the Oct. 7 election and allow his Workers Party to announce running mate Fernando Haddad as its candidate, party sources told Reuters.
Lula had hoped the Supreme Court would agree to an appeal for more time to switch the head of the Workers Party (PT) ticket after Brazil's top electoral court last week banned him from running due to a corruption conviction and gave him 10 days to remove his name.
Two sources with knowledge of Lula's decision said Haddad will become the official candidate with an announcement outside the Federal Police headquarters in the southern city of Curitiba where the leftist icon has been jailed since April, serving a 12-year sentence for receiving bribes.
Despite appeals still pending before the Supreme Court, Lula decided it was time to pass the baton to Haddad on the deadline set by the court and not run the risk of the votes for his party's ticket being annulled by the electoral court.
Lula's letter anointing Haddad will be read out to supporters who have camped outside the police building for five months to protest his jailing, which they consider a plot to keep him from returning to power, a party official said.
Lula and Haddad huddled together on Monday afternoon in his jail room and began to draw up the letter, he said.
The sources asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly about Lula's plans.
Lula served as president from 2003-2010 and remains by far Brazil's most popular politician. But he is ineligible for office under Brazil's ""Clean Slate"" law, which prohibits candidates from running if they have convictions that have been upheld on appeal.
Lula's strategy has been to keep his candidacy alive for as long as possible, then work to transfer his support to Haddad, who is barely known in many parts of Brazil.
A Datafolha poll conducted on Monday showed that transfer has begun. While still in the single digits, support for Haddad increased from 4 to 9 percent, the biggest gain among the 13 candidates running for president.

Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right politician running on a law-and-order anti-corruption platform, leads the race with 24 percent, but is in intensive care due to a near fatal stabbing at a rally last week. [nL2N1VX00G]

An official with the Gifu prefecture government said that more than 65 hogs had died since Sept. 3, and the cull was carried out in an attempt to contain the outbreak. Checks had been undertaken at other farms in the prefecture and no other cases had been found, he said.
The outbreak of the fever - a different strain from the deadly African swine fever that has broken out in China - was detected at farm in central Gifu city, the agriculture ministry said on Sunday.
The disease found in Gifu is classical swine fever (CSF), also known as hog cholera, an official at the agriculture ministry said. It occurs among pigs and wild boar, and is not infectious for humans. 
The origin and cause of the infection in Gifu were under investigation, he said.
Japan suspended exports of pork and wild boar meat after the outbreak was identified. Japan is the world's 10th largest pork producer, and exports about 12 billion yen ($108 million) worth of pork products annually.
""We don't know when we resume exports of pork, but we are discussing with the countries we export pork products to about conditions to restart,"" the ministry official said.
African swine fever was detected in China in early August and China reported 14th outbreak of the disease on Monday.
The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said Friday that around 40,000 hogs had been culled so far in China, home to the world's largest pig herd, and warned of the likelihood that the disease would spread to other Asian countries.

JOINT BASE PEARL HARBOR-HICKAM (Reuters) - The U.S. military has identified the first two American troops from 55 boxes of human remains from the 1950-53 Korean War that North Korea handed over in July, the agency leading the analysis said on Monday.
The identities are expected to be officially announced in the coming days after the troops' relatives are informed.
""We will notify the family first,"" said John Byrd, director of scientific analysis at the U.S. Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, as he stood among the remains undergoing review in Hawaii.
President Donald Trump's administration has hailed the handover of the remains as evidence of the success of his summit with North Koran leader Kim Jong Un in June. The White House said on Monday it was looking at scheduling a second meeting.
Critics, however, say the summit has so far failed to deliver on promised steps to get Kim to abandon his nuclear weapons program.
The identifications will chip away at the 7,699 U.S. troops who the U.S. military says remain unaccounted for from the Korean War. About 5,300 were lost in what is now North Korea.
Forensic anthropologists are combing through the remains at a secure facility on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. 
Byrd and Jennie Jin, who leads the agency's Korean War Project, explained the painstaking identification process which includes methods for finding DNA in bone fragments.
Sampling for DNA analysis has been carried out so far on about half of the boxes of remains, they said. Some bone fragments are as small as a quarter. Other bones have decayed so much that they are little longer than a pencil.
'HUGE BATTLE'
However, the sets of bones from the two soon-to-be-identified troops are far more complete. 
""We noticed ... within a few seconds of opening up the box, and pulling him out, that we think this individual is African American and tall and slender,"" Byrd said. ""And that kind of realization that we have was made possible because of the relatively more complete condition (of the remains)."" 
The remains of both servicemembers came from the same 1950 battlegrounds near the Chongchon River in what is present-day North Korea. U.S. troops suffered heavy casualties there against Chinese forces that had intervened in the war.
""It's a huge battle,"" said Jin, who estimated that 1,700 of the missing U.S. forces from the war came from that fight alone.
She spoke above tables of bone fragments, still separated with numbers corresponding with the 55 boxes.
Other tables included personal objects from soldiers that don't have any identification on them, including buttons, canteens and old boots.
Byrd acknowledged that it could take months for the next round of identifications. ""There could be some more and maybe right after Christmas,"" he said. 
Jin, a South Korean-born American citizen, said the work has a personal connection. Her grandfather, now 90, is a survivor of the war who came from one of the areas of present-day North Korea that saw some of the heaviest fighting. He was evacuated south on a U.S. Navy ship, she said.
""It's really personal to me,"" Jin said.
The July transfer coincided with the 65th anniversary of the 1953 armistice that ended fighting between North Korean and Chinese forces and South Korean and U.S.-led forces under the U.N. Command.
The two sides remain technically at war because a peace treaty was never signed.

The United States and North Korea conducted joint searches for remains from 1996 until 2005, when Washington halted the operations citing concerns about the safety of its personnel as Pyongyang stepped up its nuclear program.

China has said Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tension between the mostly Muslim Uighur minority who call the region home and members of the ethnic Han Chinese majority.
Last month, a United Nations rights panel said it had received credible reports that up to one million ethnic Uighurs may be held in extra-legal detention in Xinjiang, and called for them to be freed.
In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang signaled that China did not want the United Nations to get involved.
""China urges the U.N. human rights high commissioner and office to scrupulously abide by the mission and principles of the U.N. charter, respect China's sovereignty, fairly and objectively carry out its duties, and not listen to one-sided information,"" he told a daily news briefing.
The government has previously blamed anti-China forces for being behind criticism of its policies in Xinjiang.
During the past two years, authorities have dramatically stepped up security and surveillance there, likened by critics to near martial law conditions, with police checkpoints, re-education centers and mass DNA collection.
Bachelet's appeal for access came as New York-based Human Rights Watch said the Turkic Uighur minority faced arbitrary detentions, daily curbs on religious practice and ""forced political indoctrination"" in a mass security crackdown. [L3N1VW3DV]
In her maiden speech to the U.N. Human Rights Council, Bachelet said the panel had brought to light ""deeply disturbing allegations of large-scale arbitrary detentions of Uighurs and other Muslim communities, in so-called re-education camps across Xinjiang"".

Reports had been received of ""patterns of human rights violations in other regions"", added Bachelet, a former Chilean president, calling for Beijing to permit access for her staff across China, saying she expected discussions to start soon.

Germany's most violent far-right protests in decades, which took place in the eastern city over the fatal stabbing of a German man blamed on two migrants, have reignited a heated debate about Chancellor Angela Merkel's 2015 decision to open the country's borders to more than a million refugees.
Hans-Georg Maassen, who heads the BfV intelligence agency, prompted anger from lawmakers of mainstream parties last week for telling top-selling Bild he was not sure if the footage, shot in Chemnitz two weeks ago and circulated online, was genuine.
The Sueddeutsche Zeitung and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said Maassen had written to Interior Minister Horst Seehofer saying that the video had not been falsified and that his comments had been misunderstood.
Maassen said he had meant to express doubt about whether the video genuinely showed people being chased, the papers wrote.
Lawmakers including the leader of the Social Democrats (SPD), who share power with Merkel's conservatives, called on Maassen to resign if he failed to explain his comments, and it is not yet clear to what extent the new explanation will ease the pressure on him.
Maassen had appeared to contradict Merkel's view of the events in Chemnitz. She last week rebuked a conservative ally, head of the state of Saxony where Chemnitz is located, for playing down the violence. Police also arrested people in the city for giving the Nazi salute, an action that is illegal in Germany. 
Merkel and her spokesman have repeated several times that far-right violence is unacceptable in Germany.
On Monday evening several hundred right-wing supporters dressed in black gathered in the eastern city of Halle, in Saxony-Anhalt, following the death at the weekend of a German man and the arrest of two Afghans in the nearby city of Koethen. 

Police said they made 14 arrests, mainly for showing banned right-wing symbols, but there had been no serious violence.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The Taliban are preparing to send a delegation for further talks with U.S. officials about ending the conflict in Afghanistan, two officials involved with the process said on Tuesday, adding that the meeting could address a possible prisoner swap.
The two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Taliban leaders were meeting to discuss the makeup of the three- or four-person delegation and the subjects to be discussed.
They said the Taliban would like to discuss an exchange of prisoners and could hold another meeting soon if the United States showed seriousness in talks by releasing prisoners.
""This meeting will determine the future talks and we would see if the U.S. is serious and sincere in negotiation,"" one of the officials involved said.
""We would hand over a list of prisoners languishing in jails across Afghanistan. If they set free our prisoners then we would meet again for another great cause.""
If confirmed, the meeting would follow an earlier round of talks in Doha in July, where Taliban officials met Alice Wells, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia at the U.S. State Department.
The Taliban delegation at the planned upcoming meeting would be led by the head of the group's Qatar-based political office, Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanakzai, the officials said.
However they said the high command was planning to replace Stanakzai, who has been serving as interim head, with a new permanent head of the Qatar office.
""You may know Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanakzai was deputed in the Qatar office on acting charge basis. The top leadership is now planning to appoint someone else in his place,"" one said.
Hopes that peace talks to end the 17-year conflict in Afghanistan have stuttered in recent months, following the failure to agree a repeat of the unprecedented Eid ceasefire in June which saw unarmed Taliban fighters mingling with security forces in Kabul and other cities.
Over the past year, the United States has stepped up air strikes against the Taliban and boosted training for Afghan forces. However U.S. officials say the goal is to reach a negotiated, Afghan-led settlement to end the war.
On the Taliban side, the assault on the strategic city of Ghazni last month that killed hundreds of soldiers, police and civilians underlined the insurgents' determination to increase pressure on the Western-backed government in Kabul.
The Taliban, seeking to reimpose strict Islamic law after their 2001 ouster at the hands of U.S.-led troops, have maintained their refusal to negotiate directly with the internationally recognized Afghan government, which they consider an illegitimate regime put in place by foreign powers and say they will only talk to the United States.
As the push for talks has picked up following the Eid ceasefire in June, the United States has agreed to participate directly and has appointed former U.S. ambassador to Kabul Zalmay Khalilzad as special envoy to reinforce the effort.

The United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29, yet little is clear: There is, so far, no full exit deal, rivals to Prime Minister Theresa May are circling and some lawmakers are pushing for a rerun of the 2016 referendum.
Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, said on Monday that a Brexit deal was possible ""within six or eight weeks"" if negotiators were realistic in their demands.
Brexit supporters in May's Conservative Party who want a more distant relationship with the EU last week circulated a 140-page draft alternative Brexit plan.
But Conservative lawmaker Jacob Rees-Mogg, head of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, which led the work on the alternative plan, said the full document would not be published. ""The truth is that we reconsidered,"" he added.

An influential Brexiteer in May's party, Steve Baker, said on Monday that 80 or more of her lawmakers are prepared to vote against her Brexit plan.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - The United States urged Cambodia's government on Tuesday to drop all charges against opposition leader Kem Sokha, who was released on bail but has been placed under house arrest.
Kem Sokha was released from prison on Monday after spending more than a year in jail on treason charges but remains under house arrest in the capital, Phnom Penh. He was arrested last September as part of a government-led crackdown against critics.
""The U.S. government has taken note of Mr. Sokha's transfer to house arrest, which falls far short of a full release, as well as the recent freeing of other political prisoners,"" U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Emily Zeeberg said in an email.
""We continue to call on the government of Cambodia to drop all charges against Mr. Sokha, remove restrictions on the political rights of him and other opposition leaders, and engage opposition leaders in an urgent dialogue aimed at building genuine national reconciliation,"" she said.
Kem Sokha, 65, is the leader of the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), which was dissolved as part of the crackdown. The crackdown came before a July 29 general election.
Long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won all 125 parliamentary seats in the election, which the United Nations and some Western countries have said was flawed because of the lack of a credible opposition, among other factors.
Restrictions placed on Kem Sokha include a ban on him meeting CNRP officials. 
Cambodian government spokesman Phay Siphan said the conditions of Kem Sokha's bail were decided by the court.
""This is the court's jurisdiction that no institution, no NGO or no foreign country can interfere with,"" Phay Siphan said.

Hun Sen had been under pressure to release Kem Sokha and observers say he has been relaxing his stance against critics since the July election win, which secured him another five years in power.

SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump received a ""very warm, very positive"" letter from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un asking for a second meeting and the White House is looking at scheduling one, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Monday.
The two countries have been discussing North Korea's nuclear programs since their leaders met in Singapore in June, although that summit's outcome was criticized for being short on concrete details about how and whether Kim is willing to give up weapons that threaten the United States.
The likely timing of a second Trump-Kim meeting was unclear.
South Korea's President Moon Jae-in is scheduled to have his third summit with Kim next week in Pyongyang, and his government had pushed for a three-way summit involving Trump, with the aim of agreeing a joint declaration to end the 1950-53 Korean War.
The conflict ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, leaving the U.S.-led United Nations forces including South Korea technically still at war with North Korea.
While South Korea had hoped an accord formally ending the conflict could have been unveiled on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly later this month, Moon's security chief Chung Eui-yong said last week, without elaborating, that the necessary conditions for a three-way meeting were missing. 
Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton has also said he did not believe Kim would attend such a gathering. 
Hopes of progress were revived however after Trump told reporters on Friday that a personal letter from Kim was on the way.
""It was a very warm, very positive letter,"" Sanders said at Monday's briefing. 
""The primary purpose of the letter was to request and look to schedule another meeting with the president which we are open to and are already in the process of coordinating that,"" she said.
Sanders told reporters the letter exhibited ""a continued commitment to focus on denuclearization of the peninsula.""
She said a military parade in Pyongyang on Sunday was ""a sign of good faith"" because it did not feature any long-range missiles.
In South Korea, officials nurtured hope that next week's inter-Korean summit could provide renewed momentum to nuclear negotiations, after last month's setback when Trump canceled a visit to Pyongyang by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo due to a lack of progress. 
South Korea's President Moon is expected to present some proposal to Kim suggesting phased steps toward denuclearization and U.S. security guarantees including an official end to the Korean War. Moon could then discuss the idea when he meets Trump during the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York later this month, South Korean officials said. 
Trump asked Moon to act as ""chief negotiator"" between Washington and Pyongyang during their phone call last week, Moon's spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom told reporters. 
""In order for us to move toward the next level of dismantling North Korea's existing nuclear weapons, the leaders of North Korea and the United States once again must have big ideas and take bold decisions,"" Moon told a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. 
""North Korea should abolish its nuclear programs, and the 
United States foster such conditions with corresponding action.""
WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY
The nuclear envoys of South Korea and the United States also held a meeting on Tuesday as part of efforts to jumpstart stalled nuclear talks between Pyongyang and Washington.
Lee Do-hoon, South Korea's nuclear negotiator, told reporters that he and his U.S. counterpart Stephen Biegun discussed how to bring progress on the North's denuclearization and establishing peace on the Korean peninsula. 
""We take this very seriously, the responsibility that is on both of us,"" Biegun told Lee at the start of the talks. 
""But we also have a tremendous opportunity created by President Trump, by President Moon and by Chairman Kim. We need to do everything we can to make the most of this moment of opportunity.""
Harry Kazianis, director of defense studies from the Centre for the National Interest, a think tank in Washington reckoned Trump was right to pursue a second meeting with the North Korean leader .
""When you combine Kim's pledge to denuclearize by the end of Trump's first term, as well as not displaying any long-range ballistic missiles during the north's recent 70th anniversary celebrations, there are reasons for optimism,"" he said.

The updated guidance from the Federal Aviation Administration to U.S. operators, issued on Sunday at the expiry of the prior year's advisory, said there were also military activities emanating from or transiting through Iran's airspace associated with the conflict in Syria. 
Tensions ramped up between Iran and the United States after President Donald Trump pulled out of a landmark nuclear deal with Iran in May and reimposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic last month.
Flight Service Bureau, which provides safety information on airspace to airlines, said ""without seeming alarmist"", the deteriorating relationship between the U.S. and Iran must be taken into account when planning flights in Iran's airspace.
""Although the reopening of Iraqi airspace in November last year has provided additional routing options ... there is no perfect route in the region, and operators must consider their preference for Iraq vs Iran,"" the U.S. based group said in an email to clients on Monday.
The U.S. Department of State advises that its citizens do not travel to Iran due to the risk of arbitrary arrest and detention. Flight Service Bureau said that could present problems in the event of an unplanned landing in Iran for medical or technical reasons.
For Iraq, the U.S. Department of State advises its citizens against travel to the country due to terrorism and armed conflict. The F.A.A.'s latest guidance on Iraq, issued in December 2017, prohibits U.S. airlines in most cases from flying at an altitude lower than 26,000 feet due to the potential for fighting.

(Reuters) - A Texas grand jury could potentially charge a Dallas police officer with murder in the shooting death of a neighbor whose apartment the officer said she mistook for her own, a prosecutor said on Monday, as the victim's family demanded more answers.
Meanwhile, according to the Dallas Morning News, dozens of people marched through the city's downtown on Monday evening, blocking traffic at times, to protest last Thursday's fatal shooting of Botham Shem Jean, 26, an unarmed black man, by the white officer.
Amber Guyger, 30, a four-year veteran of the Dallas police force, was arrested on Sunday and charged with manslaughter, a lesser offense than murder for an unlawful killing that does not involve malice aforethought.
Police said Guyger has told investigators she mistook Jean's residence for her own and shot him believing he was an intruder.
Questions have been raised over why there was a delay in charging Guyger and how she failed to know she was not in her own apartment.
An attorney for Guyger, who was released on $300,000 bond, could not be reached for comment. 
District Attorney Faith Johnson told reporters on Monday, ""We plan to present a thorough case to the grand jury of Dallas County so that the right decision can be made in this case."" 
The grand jury may decide to uphold the manslaughter charge on which she was arrested, or it could consider charging Guyger with murder, Johnson said.
Guyger, who came home from her shift on Thursday in uniform, mistakenly went to Jean's apartment one floor above her own and managed to enter because the door was slightly ajar, according to an arrest warrant affidavit posted online by local media.
Entering the darkened apartment, she noticed a figure whom she said she mistook for a burglar and fired twice, striking Jean once in the chest, the affidavit said. 
Attorneys for Jean's family challenged that account. 
""This wasn't her apartment, so there wouldn't be the same smell, there wouldn't be the same furniture, there wouldn't be the same lighting pattern,"" S. Lee Merritt, an attorney for Jean's family, said at a news conference on Monday. 
Two witnesses who live at the apartment building have described hearing knocks at a door before the shooting, and one of the witnesses heard a woman's voice saying, ""Let me in,"" Merritt said. 

The results of a blood test on Guyger for drugs and alcohol were still pending, a police spokesman said.

1477,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 11:20PM ET</span>",China does away with family planning offices,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's health commission is getting rid of three offices that were previously dedicated to family planning, it announced late on Sunday, the latest signal that Beijing may further reduce restrictions on childbirth to combat an aging population.
State-media has hinted in recent weeks that China, the world's most populous nation, may be preparing to end its decades-long policy of determining the number of children that couples can have.
Last month, speculation of a further easing mounted after a new stamp unveiled by China Post featured a family of two pigs with three cheerful piglets, followed weeks later by a draft of the civil code dropping all mention of family planning. 
Three offices responsible for grassroots implementation of family planning policies have been removed from the new structure of China's National Health Commission, according to an announcement from the commission.
Instead, a new office for ""population monitoring and family development"" will be responsible for ""improving birth policy and to organize implementation, and to establish and improve the system of extraordinary family assistance for family planning.""
The commission still retains responsibility for ""family planning management and facilitation work"" and for the ""improvement of family planning policy,"" it said. 
""Family planning"" was dropped from the commission's name in March, as part of a sweeping government overhaul to reform government departments and reduce policymaking red tape.
China has loosened its family planning policy as its population grays, birth rates slow and its workforce declines. In 2016, the government allowed couples in urban areas to have two children, replacing a controversial one-child policy enforced since 1979.
While China's population growth fell well below the world average under the one-child policy, Chinese policymakers have become wary of falling birth rates and a rapidly growing aging population.
As of 2017, people aged 60 and above accounted for about 16.2 percent of China's population, compared to 7.4 percent in 1950, according to the U.N. Population Division.

Bloomberg reported in May that China was planning to scrap all limits on the number of children a family can have by the end of 2018.

1478,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 10:28PM ET</span>",Brazil presidential candidate Bolsonaro gains little after stabbing: poll,"By Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was stabbed in the stomach during a campaign rally last week, maintained his lead but saw no big boost in a Datafolha poll published Monday.
The first survey conducted since the near-fatal stabbing of Bolsonaro showed he won 24 percent of potential votes among those polled, up from 22 percent in a Datafolha survey released last month. Leftist Ciro Gomes rose to second place, taking 13 percent, up from 10 percent.
The knife attack against Bolsonaro further complicated Brazil's most unpredictable election in three decades, with its most popular politician, jailed former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, banned from running in the Oct. 7 vote due to a corruption conviction.
In the likely case of a runoff ballot, the survey found that Bolsonaro would tie with Fernando Haddad, who is almost certain to be named as the Workers Party candidate this week, but would lose badly to all other top rivals.
Bolsonaro, a former army captain who favors easing gun control laws to fight crime, has stirred controversy with comments denigrating women, gays, blacks and indigenous people. He has led the field from the outset in polls that excluded Lula, by tapping into voter anger over political corruption. 
Gomes, a former governor of Ceará state in Brazil's poor northeast, showed in a Sunday night presidential debate that his attacks on Bolsonaro would not be slowed by the latter's stabbing, when he said that the right-wing congressmen ""had suffered a wound to his stomach, but it changed nothing in his head."" 
Environmentalist Marina Silva fell from second to third place in the Datafolha survey, taking 11 percent, dropping 5 percentage points. 
The poll by Globo TV and the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper was released as Lula spent the day in jailhouse meetings with former Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad, who remains as the vice presidential candidate on the PT ticket.
The PT's strategy has been to keep Lula's candidacy alive for as long as possible, then work to transfer his support to Haddad, who polled 9 percent, compared with 4 percent in the same poll a few weeks ago.
Haddad's chances of making the second-round runoff between the two candidates who get the most votes will hinge on his ability to tap into the massive support enjoyed by Lula. 
In Monday's poll, business-friendly center-right candidate Geraldo Alckmin registered 10 percent, ticking up from the 9 percent he won last month. 

Datafolha surveyed 2,804 voters across Brazil on Monday. The poll has a margin of error of two percentage points.

1479,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 09:11PM ET</span>","More than 30,000 displaced in Syria's Idlib in latest offensive: U.N.","BEIRUT/GENEVA (Reuters) - More than 30,000 people have so far fled their homes in northwest Syria since Syrian government and allied forces resumed air and ground bombardments there last week, the U.N. agency coordinating relief efforts said on Monday.
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said an all-out military assault on the last major stronghold of active opposition to President Bashar al-Assad could set 800,000 people to flight. The OCHA chief, Mark Lowcock, warned that this risked provoking the worst humanitarian catastrophe of the 21st Century.
Damascus, backed by Russia and Iran, has been preparing a major assault to recover Idlib and adjacent areas of northwest Syria from rebels. 
Russian and Syrian warplanes resumed their bombing campaign last week and the presidents of Turkey, Iran and Russia on Friday failed to agree on a ceasefire that would forestall the offensive.
OCHA spokesman David Swanson told Reuters that as of Sunday, 30,542 people had been displaced from northwest Syria, moving to different areas across Idlib.
About 2.9 million people live in the opposition-held area, which comprises most of Idlib province and adjacent small parts of Latakia, Hama and Aleppo provinces. Around half of them are already displaced from other parts of Syria.
ON THE MOVE AGAIN
""We are very actively preparing for the possibility that civilians move in huge numbers in multiple directions,"" OCHA head Lowcock told a news briefing in Geneva.
""There needs to be ways of dealing with this problem that don't turn the next few months in Idlib into the worst humanitarian catastrophe with the biggest loss of life of the 21st Century,"" he said.
Swanson said that since Friday's summit, mortar and rocket attacks had increased, especially in the northern Hama countryside and southern Idlib rural areas. 
He said 47 percent of those displaced have moved to camps, 29 percent are staying with families, 14 percent have settled in informal camps and 10 percent are in rented accommodation. 
Abu al-Baraa al-Hamawi, a rebel leader in northern Hama, said about 95 percent of people had left a number of villages in northern and western Hama province and in southern Idlib province in the last three days due to intensive air strikes.
More than half a million people have been killed and 11 million already forced to flee their homes in Syria's seven-year-old war.
Christy Delafield of Mercy Corps, one of the largest organizations delivering aid in Syria, said it has been hard for aid workers and communities to keep up with the displacement.
""There is a lack of water storage capacity in many of the areas in which we operate, with just two or three days worth of water available to civilians,"" she told Reuters. 
""The crossing points along the front lines between the government and opposition-controlled areas have been closed, and as a result, food prices have dramatically increased."" 
The opposition accuses Russia and its allies of striking at hospitals and civil defense centers to force rebels to surrender in a repeat of earlier, large-scale military offensives.
Russia has said it wants all militants to be pushed out of Idlib and that it avoids civilians and targets only radical al Qaeda-inspired groups.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said rebel shelling on Monday had hit Hama military airport and another nearby military complex which lie in government-held territory. 
U.N. Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura began two days of talks in Geneva on Monday with senior officials from Russia, Iran and Turkey on forming a Constitutional Committee in Syria, but which were expected to be overshadowed by the Idlib crisis.
Tehran and Moscow have helped Assad turn the course of the war against an array of opponents ranging from Western-backed rebels to Islamist militants. Turkey is a leading opposition supporter which has troops in the country and has erected 12 observation posts around rebel-held Idlib.

Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar on Monday was reported as saying by broadcaster NTV that air and ground attacks on Idlib must stop and a ceasefire must be established.

All organizations engaged in the dissemination of religious information online will be obliged to apply for licenses from provincial religious affairs departments, the paper said, citing a policy document issued on Monday.
While the license will enable them to ""preach and offer religious training"", they will not be allowed to live-stream or broadcast religious activities. The dissemination of religious information anywhere other than their own internet platforms is also forbidden. 
The guidelines also specifically prohibit online religious services from inciting subversion, opposing the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and promoting extremism and separatism.
Chinese citizens are theoretically free to practice any religion as long as it is officially recognized by the government. It has repeatedly cracked down on unauthorized religious activity, with authorities in Beijing shutting down a large Protestant church on Monday. 
China has also been under heavy international scrutiny for its treatment of its mostly Muslim Uighur minority in the northwestern region of Xinjiang. 
Human rights groups have accused the Chinese government of conducting a punitive crackdown that has seen the detention of as many as 1 million ethnic Uighurs in internment camps.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Hundreds of peasant farmers and indigenous Maya blocked a major highway in Guatemala's western highlands on Monday, demanding that President Jimmy Morales reverse a policy aimed at forcing a U.N.-backed anti-graft unit to leave the country.
Groups representing the protesters said in a statement they planned more rallies over the next two days, including in capital Guatemala City, after Morales announced at the end of August that he would not renew the mandate of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG).
Although CICIG can operate in Guatemala until the end of next year, Morales' government applied further pressure last week by prohibiting Ivan Velasquez, the head of the investigative unit, from returning to Guatemala, for reasons of ""public security.""
Morales' predecessor is in prison and standing trial for running a customs racket uncovered by CICIG. Last year, the commission started investigating the current president's family for alleged corruption and supported an impeachment of Morales.
Morales, a former comedian elected in 2015, denies any wrongdoing and says the CICIG has overstepped its remit.
Protesters in the western highlands town of Solola brandished placards demanding Morales resign, broadcast images showed.
""We believe the leadership of commissioner Velasquez is important for the fight against corruption,"" said protester Josue Chavajay by phone. 
""Guatemala has changed, it is not the same as it was three years ago (when Morales was elected),"" said Chavajay.
The CICIG was formed in 2006 to help Guatemalan prosecutors break a cycle of impunity that helped organized crime penetrate government in the Central American country, and it is credited with improving the justice system. 
Morales' decision to end the body's charter in Guatemala was heavily criticized by the United Nations and European countries. 
The U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations also questioned the move in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday, pointing out that U.S.-donated military vehicles had appeared near the CICIG headquarters and the U.S. embassy on the day of the announcement by Morales, who spoke while flanked by soldiers.
The deployment of the vehicles ""appeared intended to send a political message,"" said the letter, calling the move ""unacceptable."" 
Guatemala had a series of military governments in the 1970s and 1980s, and the military remains influential in politics. 
The U.S. State Department, which has backed the CICIG in the past, has been more ambiguous in its comments. Pompeo called Morales last week and expressed ""continued support for a reformed CICIG,"" spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Thursday.
U.S. funding is important for the CICIG. Morales has been one of the few world leaders to back U.S. President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital by shifting the Guatemalan embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.
On Monday, the head of the U.N. human rights office, former Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, said the decisions to end the CICIG mandate and block Velasquez were ""deplorable."" 

Last week, the Guatemalan government asked U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres not to interfere in the country's affairs after he expressed concern about the decisions.

CURITIBA, Brazil (Reuters) - Brazil's imprisoned former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will not yet bow out of next month's presidential race, waiting first to hear a Supreme Court decision on an appeal of his ban from running, his legal team said.
His decision takes his leftist Workers' Party (PT) close to the limit on registering a candidate for the Oct. 7 election, with a court having set Tuesday as the deadline for the PT to name a replacement nominee.
Lula served as president from 2003-2010 and remains by far Brazil's most popular politician. But he is ineligible for office under Brazil's ""Clean Slate"" law, which prohibits candidates from running if they have convictions that have been upheld on appeal.
He spent Monday meeting in his prison cell with his lawyers and Fernando Haddad, who is the vice presidential candidate on the PT ticket and is Lula's choice to replace him once his appeals are exhausted.
Lula had been expected to hand over a letter to Haddad during the meeting, asking his followers to vote for Haddad, party sources said last week. 
But the former leader decided to hold off on the handover, and is asking the Supreme Court to extend the Tuesday deadline for candidate registration as he has two separate appeals asking courts to reverse his ban.
Haddad, who had been expected to attend a rally in Sao Paulo on Monday night, instead canceled his trip and will remain in Curitiba to meet with Lula.
The PT's strategy has been to keep Lula's candidacy alive for as long as possible, then work to transfer his support to Haddad, whose backing is in single figures.
Haddad's chances of making a probable second-round runoff between the top two candidates will hinge on his ability to tap into the massive support enjoyed by Lula.
Despite his conviction and several graft cases pending against him, Lula, who denies any wrongdoing, leads the electoral race by a long stretch.

The next most popular candidate after Lula in opinion polls, Jair Bolsonaro, is in serious condition in intensive care after being stabbed while campaigning last week.

(Reuters) - A federal judge in Washington, D.C. on Monday ordered Iran to pay $104.7 million to victims of a June 1996 truck bombing in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia that killed 19 U.S. military personnel, though it is unclear when and how the plaintiffs might collect.
Chief Judge Beryl Howell entered a default judgment against Iran and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which did not defend against claims over their alleged roles in the attack, which sheared off the front of the Khobar Towers complex.
Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Howell said 15 service members who were at the complex when it was bombed could recover for assault, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
The judge also said 24 relatives could recover for emotional distress from seeing how the bombing affected their loved ones.
Howell rejected punitive damages, saying U.S. law did not allow them for attacks occurring before 2008.
The lawsuit sought damages under the so-called terrorism exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.
""The plaintiffs are very pleased with the decision, and look forward to pursuing collections,"" Paul Gaston, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview. ""Having the court ruling gives them some measure of justice.""
Thirteen members of Hezbollah were indicted in June 2001 in the federal court in Alexandria, Virginia over their alleged roles in the attack.
In December 2006, another federal judge in Washington ordered Iran to pay $254.4 million to family members and the estates of 17 Americans who died in the attack, also in a default judgment.
The U.S. government in 2015 established the U.S. Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund to compensate victims.

Monson, 47, a tattooed cage fighter known as The Snowman, registered in June to run for a seat on the council of Krasnogorsk, northwest of Moscow, where election documents say he now works as a coach in a sports club.
On the website of Moscow region's election commission, Monson is listed as fourth on the ruling United Russia party's list of candidates for the Krasnogorsk city council. 
United Russia won 47.9 percent of this vote, automatically securing a seat for the MMA fighter, who was born in the U.S. state of Minnesota.
Writing on social media, Monson, who has previously cultivated ties to the Russian Communist Party, said he ran as an independent.
""I was invited by United Russia party to run but I am independent. Unfortunately I learned there are no communists in Communist party in Russia,"" Monson said on Monday.
Monson, a vocal critic of U.S. foreign policy, said in January 2016 he was applying for Russian citizenship because he had felt a solidarity with the Russian people since he first visited their country in 2011.
""I have big plans for work with children, am preparing various projects, including projects focused on promoting healthy lifestyles,"" Monson was cited as saying on election day by the local division of the United Russia party.
""Everything I do in Krasnogorsk - it's because I love Russia,"" Monson was cited as saying. 

Videos shared on Monson's official Instagram page showed the sportsman in a Russia hockey team sweater, casting a ballot at a Krasnogorsk polling station with the help of a translator.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is ""gravely concerned"" by reports of excessive force used by Uganda's security forces against lawmakers and journalists in the northwestern town of Arua, a State Department official said on Monday after the country's opposition called on Washington to suspend military support to Kampala.
A group of five lawmakers, including opposition leader Robert Kyagulanyi, who is also a musician known by his stage name Bobi Wine, were arrested in Arua last month. Kyagulanyi, who is currently in the United States for medical treatment, and fellow member of parliament Francis Zaake say they were tortured while in detention.
""We have received multiple credible reports of excessive use of force by the Special Forces Command (SFC), including abuse of members of parliament, journalists and others,"" the State Department official said in a statement. ""The United States has made clear to the Ugandan government that such human rights abuses are unacceptable.""
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, in power since 1986, on Sunday warned against foreign interference in Uganda's politics.
Washington is a major source of funding for Uganda's military, supplying hardware, cash and training. It has given equipment, money and intelligence for the military's hunt for Lord's Resistance Army warlord Joseph Kony.
Museveni has also received diplomatic support from Washington for deploying troops in international peacekeeping missions including the fight against militants in Somalia.
The State Department official said the U.S. embassy in Kampala had not worked with Uganda's Special Forces Command (SFC) since early 2016 because of human rights concerns. The U.S. relationship with Uganda was aimed at promoting stability and security in the region, the official added.
""It is now up to the Ugandan government to demonstrate a respect for its constitution and its citizens and conduct a transparent, credible, and timely investigation into these events,"" the official said. ""Any security personnel found to have used inappropriate force must be held accountable.""
Kyagulanyi has gained popularity for his attacks on Museveni. He was charged with treason last month over the suspected stoning of Museveni's convoy in Arua. He denies the charge and says he was tortured in detention.

He arrived in the United States last week for treatment for his injuries. Representatives from the State Department met with Kyagulanyi on Thursday ""as they have done in the past when he visited the United States,"" according to an official.

The deal could be worth more than $3 billion and falls under the Russian flagship carrier's new strategy to focus on regional routes, the Vedomosti business daily reported on Monday.
Aeroflot, which is controlled by the state, said last month it would focus its 2023 strategy on launching new regional bases and hubs, as well as on increasing the proportion of Russian aircraft in its fleet.
Currently, almost two-thirds of all domestic flights in Russia go via Moscow. In May, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the share of flights bypassing the capital should increase to 50 percent by 2024. 
""It is Aeroflot's top priority to act in the interests of Russian aviation and the whole country,"" the carrier's chief executive Vitaly Saveliev said.
The 95-year-old carrier currently operates 49 SSJ 100 planes.
""Their operating efficiency is very low compared to other aircraft (as they require) regular breaks and lengthy maintenance"", Aton analysts said in a note, adding that they are a better fit for regional routes. 
Aeroflot had 350 aircraft in its fleet as of June 30 and predominantly operates narrow-body Airbus models.

Earlier this year it struck a $5 billion deal to lease 50 Russia-made MS-21 planes.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's environmental regulator expanded its investigation into a gas poisoning incident in coastal town Quintero, bringing charges of non-compliance with environmental agreements on Monday against a gas plant.
The environmental inspectorate (SMA) said Gasmar, a company that imports and sells liquefied petroleum gas and is part-owned by Chilean industrial conglomerate Copec, has 10 days to present a compliance plan or appeal the accusation that it failed to adhere to agreed levels of residual gas flaring from its chimneys. 
The charge against Gasmar comes on the heels of stricter monitoring by SMA following a gas poisoning incident in August in which hundreds of people showed symptoms of gas inhalation poisoning, prompting ongoing protests over the government's handling of the issue. 
Within days, the SMA ordered the suspension of some operations by the state-owned energy company ENAP[ENAP.UL], also in the Quintero industrial zone, about 90 miles northeast of Santiago. The company has denied responsibility for the incident. 
The SMA said in a statement on Monday that its audit of Gasmar's operations had not yet detected any pollution or harm caused to people living nearby. However, it called the charge against Gasmar ""serious"" and said it was brought because the company failed to mitigate its potentially adverse environmental impact.
Quintero has had several pollution incidents in the past, including gas and oil leaks, leading to investigations and fines against companies for non-compliance with environmental obligations. 
The SMA has admitted it struggles to supervise the operations of the 15 large-scale industrial plants based in the area.
Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt told local television station Canal 13 over the weekend that ENAP was not the only company responsible for polluting the area. She said the government had asked state miner Codelco and AES Gener, an electricity generation firm, to provide information about their emissions on Sept. 4 when another environmental incident left 20 people ill.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican is preparing a response to bombshell allegations made by an Italian archbishop who asked Pope Francis to step down, accusing him of covering up sexual misconduct by an American cardinal, his top advisers said on Monday.
The statement came at the end of the first day of a three-day meeting of the ""C-9"", a group of nine cardinals from around the world who meet with the pope at the Vatican several times a year to advise him on Church matters.
In an 11-page statement published on Aug. 26, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, the former Vatican ambassador to Washington, launched an unprecedented broadside by a Church insider against the pope and a long list of Vatican and U.S. Church officials.
The cardinals' statement said they had expressed their ""total solidarity with the pope over events of the last few weeks"" and added that the Holy See was preparing ""eventual and necessary clarifications"".
Viganò said he had told Francis soon after the pontiff's election in 2013 that Theodore McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington D.C., had engaged in sexual misconduct.
Viganò, who is in hiding and communicating through the same conservative journalists who helped him prepare, edit and distribute his broadside, said the pope had done nothing and even lifted sanctions that had been imposed on McCarrick by Benedict, the previous pope.
Francis in July accepted the resignation of McCarrick, 88, who became the first cardinal in living memory to lose his red hat and title.
""CREDIBLE"" ALLEGATIONS 
American Church officials had said allegations that McCarrick had sexually abused a 16-year-old boy almost 50 years ago were credible and substantiated.
McCarrick has said he has ""absolutely no recollection"" of the alleged abuse of the teenager.
Critics say Viganò's statement has holes and contradictions and is his vendetta for not being made a cardinal by Francis.
They say McCarrick disregarded any sanctions, appearing in public often, even alongside Benedict, in the years after Viganò says the former pope acted against McCarrick.
Hours after Viganò's statement was printed in conservative media outlets, Francis told reporters on his plane returning from a trip to Ireland that he would ""not say a word"" about the statement because it ""speaks for itself"".
He did not, however, rule out an institutional response, such as the one the cardinals said the Vatican was preparing. The cardinals' statement gave no indication when the clarification would be issued. 
The cardinals also said they had asked the pope to ""reflect"" on the work, structure and make-up of the group that was formed five years ago, taking into consideration ""the advanced age of some of its members.""
Francis spoke of his intention to make changes to the C-9 in an exclusive interview with Reuters in June, saying he wanted to ""renew it a bit"".

Two of the members of the current C-9, Australian Cardinal George Pell and Chilean Cardinal Francisco Javier Errázuriz Ossa, are under a cloud for allegations related Church sexual abuse scandals in their countries. Both have denied any wrongdoing.

The two vessels had set out from the Libyan coast early on Sept. 1, each carrying scores of people, mostly African, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said in a statement on its website.
One boat's engine failed later that day and the other began to deflate, it quoted a survivor as saying. Some survived by clinging to floating wreckage.
A survivor told MSF that “European rescuers"" had come by aircraft and thrown life rafts, but migrants remained in the water for hours.
""On our boat, only 55 people survived. Many people died, including families and children. They could have been saved if rescuers had come earlier,"" MSF quoted the unidentified survivor as saying.
Sudanese, Malians, Nigerians, Cameroonians, Ghanaians, Libyans, Algerians and Egyptians were among those on board the wrecked vessels.
Many survivors were brought to the Libyan port of Khoms on Sept. 2 by the Libyan coastguard, MSF said.
The agency said they faced further ordeals in Libya.
""Many of the survivors are mourning the loss of their relatives,"" it said. ""Instead of receiving the support they need, refugees and migrants are arrested and detained in deplorable living conditions, without basic safeguards or legal recourse."" 
It added: ""MSF reiterates its call to end the arbitrary detention of thousands of refugees and migrants across Libya.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - European countries must not rush to repatriate Afghan refugees to their increasingly insecure homeland or blame their community for isolated crimes such as recent deadly attacks in Germany and in France, the top U.N. refugee official said on Monday.
Two Afghans have been detained in Germany on suspicion of killing a 22-year-old German man, the public prosecutor's office said on Sunday.
French police detained a man who wounded several people in a knife attack in central Paris on Sunday, police and judicial sources said on Monday. The attacker, who a police source said was from Afghanistan, stabbed tourists and passersby.
Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that sending Afghan refugees home was a ""complex issue in Europe"" - despite a spate of suicide bombs and attacks across Afghanistan, including by the Taliban and Islamic State.
""There is a lot of pressure for Afghans to return. Our advice is to carry out this process with great caution because conditions from the security point of view are deteriorating,"" he told a news conference on return from Afghanistan.
Grandi, asked whether he feared any backlash against Afghan nationals in Europe, said: ""If anybody who is either an asylum seeker or a refugee commits crimes, this person has to be excluded from the (asylum) process or from refugee status.""
UNHCR spokeswoman Melissa Fleming later clarified that such exclusion applies only when a serious crime has been committed before the asylum seeker enters a country, and is then taken into account during the asylum process, before the person is determined to be a refugee. Refugee status is retained when a refugee commits a crime in the asylum country, but that person is subject to prosecution. 
Grandi said suspects must bear the full force of law, but voiced concern that an entire community could be blamed for the crimes of an individual, or the issue manipulated for political purposes.
""This is very dangerous, because asylum seekers and refugees in their overwhelming majority do not commit crimes, and are particularly vulnerable to discrimination.""
Pakistan and Iran together host some 2.5 million Afghan refugees, but only 12,000 returned home so far this year against 40,000-50,000 at this time in 2017, according to his agency.
Some 40,000 people were killed or maimed in the past 4 years of conflict in Afghanistan and 170,000 people newly-displaced this year alone, U.N. emergency humanitarian coordinator Mark Lowcock said.
He welcomed talks between the government of President Ashraf Ghani and Taliban insurgents, saying they needed to be supported.

""That probably is also the single biggest thing that will contribute to better economic prospects and people feeling more confident about the prospects and then that is what will be biggest driver in Afghans feeling they can go home,"" he added.

""Decisions will be made according to a bilateral framework between two countries that are partners and have signed a contract and it will be resolved amicably,"" Defense Minister Margarita Robles said in the Spanish Senate.
On Tuesday the ministry said it was halting the sale of the bombs amid concerns about their use in the conflict in Yemen.
On Monday, Robles said the contract was under revision and that the Spanish government would respect the Charter of the United Nations regarding human rights.
Amnesty International and other human rights groups have denounced Western arms sales to Saudi Arabia and its allies, fighting a war in Yemen which the United Nations says has killed more than 10,000 people and left 8.4 million on the brink of famine.
The defense ministry said last month it had never sold arms that could be used against a civilian population and condemned the killing of non-combatants in Yemen. It said it would review any sales that had not yet been closed and which could involve weapons that could be used against civilians.
Robles said on Monday the potential sale of the 400 bombs was not linked to a framework agreement to sell the Gulf Arab state warships, a deal estimated to be worth around 1.8 billion euros.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The U.S. military and European operators of the radar-evading F-35 fighter jet have agreed to work together more closely to help lower the cost of operating the new warplanes as growing numbers arrive in Europe, officials said.
Operating costs were a big issue when senior military officials from the United States, Israel and F-35 user nations in Europe - Britain, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Turkey, the Netherlands - met in Germany last week, they said.
""We discussed the importance of ensuring that future costs - specifically for sustainment - are kept to a minimum so that we don't have to cut into future purchases,"" U.S. Air Force Colonel Leslie Hauck, who heads the fifth generation integration office at the U.S. Air Force headquarters in Europe, told Reuters.
U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein this year launched a big push to drive down the cost of flying and servicing the  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) jets to the same levels as current fighters without stealth capabilities.
Experts say the Air Force - the biggest buyer of the F-35 - could cut back its planned purchase of 1,763 aircraft unless it can lower the cost of flying the world's most advanced fighter aircraft.
The latest Pentagon selected acquisition report on the program put the cost per flying hour of the F-35 at around $30,000 per flying hour in 2012 dollars, compared to around $25,500 per hour for an older-generation F-16 fighter. Fuel cost changes could boost that sum in inflation-adjusted dollars.
The cost of buying new jets has come down and is expected to reach $80 million per aircraft by 2020, but more work is needed to reduce the cost of operating the jets, Hauck said. He said the Air Force wanted to cut the operating cost by 38 percent.
He said air chiefs from the user nations discussed the issue at the Royal International Air Tattoo, the world's largest military air show, in England in July, and it would be a key focal point during a working-group meeting in November.
The Pentagon's F-35 program office last week said it would compile and distribute information from users about maintenance procedures, staffing requirements and other key metrics.
""There are things that we can do with our group. But there's not a good mechanism now to share the lessons learned,"" Hauck said, noting that his office was also reaching out to F-35 users in Asia - Japan, Australia and South Korea - for their input.

Together the allies will have some 64 F-35s in Europe by 2019 and 550 by 2034, General Tod Wolters, the head of U.S. and NATO air forces in Europe, told officials at last week's meeting. The first U.S. F-35s are set to arrive in 2021.

CAIRO (Reuters) - A U.N. agency that supports Palestinian refugees will target additional funding from Gulf states and European partners as it seeks to make up a $200 million shortfall caused by a U.S. aid cutoff, the agency's head said on Monday.
""We face an unprecedented financial crisis,"" said Pierre Krahenbuhl, Commissioner-General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), in Cairo to try to drum up support at an Arab League meeting on Tuesday.
""We have decided that it is essential for us to close the historic shortfall that we faced of $446 million, by reaching out to many other countries and among them member states of the League of Arab States."" 
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar have already announced $50 million each for UNRWA, said Krahenbuhl, adding that Japan, India and China had also provided new or increased support.
UNRWA provides services to about 5 million Palestinian refugees across Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the West Bank and Gaza. Most are descendants of some 700,000 Palestinians who were driven out of their homes or fled fighting in the 1948 war that led to Israel's creation.
The growing refugee count was cited by Washington, UNRWA's biggest donor, in its decision late last month to withhold funding.
The U.S. decision threatened UNRWA's provision of healthcare and emergency aid as well as education for 526,000 Palestinian refugee children -- though schools did recently open for the new year.
""We are very determined to keep the schools open because you can't go through an education process by opening one day and closing three weeks later,"" said Krahenbuhl.
""I can't imagine going back to our students and saying we've failed."" 
Krahenbuhl said he was hoping that other Gulf states would offer further contributions and back efforts to find new donors in other regions. The agency will seek to mobilize European partners in the coming weeks as well as campaigning for private donations.
""We still need approximately $200 million to close this year's shortfall ... We will knock on every door to make sure we get the necessary support."" 
The U.N. General Assembly had given UNRWA its mandate and approved the definition of Palestinian refugees, he noted. 

""It is not for an individual member state to define a change. This is a question that rests with the General Assembly and with nobody else.""

1498,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 01:18PM ET</span>",Pound gains on cautious Barnier Brexit deal comment,"By Marja Novak and Gabriela Baczynska
BLED, Slovenia/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A cautious comment by the EU Brexit negotiator that there could be a deal by November if unrealistic demands are taken off the table boosted sterling on Monday amid new optimism among investors.
Reports that Michel Barnier had told a public forum in Slovenia that it was ""realistic"" to expect a deal in six to eight weeks helped send the British currency to a five-week high of $1.3052, up around 1 percent on the day, rising also around 0.3 percent against the euro.
""Michel Barnier ... said realistically we can expect to reach the Brexit agreement in the next 6-8 weeks,"" the British embassy in Slovenia said from the forum in Bled.
However, what Barnier actually did was to repeat a standard recent line that if negotiators -- meaning particularly Prime Minister Theresa May's government -- compromise further, then it would be possible to complete divorce terms on schedule. 
""I think that if we are realistic, we are able to reach an agreement on the first stage of the negotiation, which is the Brexit treaty, within six or eight weeks,"" he said.
""Taking into account the time necessary for the ratification process ... we must reach an agreement before the beginning of November. I think it is possible.""
But, he said, a major sticking point remains managing the Irish border, where Brussels has said London's proposals to avoid undermining either peace in Northern Ireland or the EU's single market regulations have so far been unrealistic.
The pound slid back in late afternoon to stand 0.77 percent higher on the dollar.
BREXIT SCHEDULE
Barnier has regularly said that he wants a deal by November to ensure parliamentary ratification by March, when Britain must leave, with or without a deal. He has routinely said that this timetable is a realistic one if negotiators find compromises.
He stressed He was neither optimistic nor pessimistic.
Currency traders have interpreted other Barnier comments this month as indicating a diminishing chance of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal to clarify legal issues, although EU officials and diplomats have echoed his public comments that there remain major differences on Ireland.
May is under attack from members of her own party over her proposals for a separate declaration on how trade would work in future after a 21-month status-quo transition period. EU officials say that raises a risk that May could struggle to win parliamentary backing for any deal.
For that reason, they expect EU leaders to go on trying to be helpful to May's cause, including by offering conciliatory messages when they meet her next Thursday at a summit in Austria. However, few diplomats see significant signs of a softening in the EU line on future trade or Ireland.
Few expect the next Brussels summit on Oct. 18-19 to see a breakthrough and talks are under way among EU governments to set a special Brexit summit for mid-November.

Some EU officials say a deal with Britain in December, even January, could leave just about enough time to ratify by March. Some EU diplomats also speak of Britain asking to prolong the talks beyond the current exit date of March 29, despite huge opposition to such an idea from many of May's supporters.

Bolsonaro, 63, was stabbed at a campaign rally on Thursday in an assassination attempt that plunged the presidential race into further confusion as it appears unlikely he will be able to resume campaigning before the Oct. 7 vote.
The medical bulletin issued by the Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo contrasted with the up-beat report on Sunday that said Bolsonaro's health had improved markedly and that he had walked for a few minutes but was still receiving food intravenously.
The new report said his condition was still serious and he would need additional surgery since he has a colostomy bag that needs to be removed and the intestine perforated by the stabbing repaired.
There are no signs of infection, the bulletin added.
The knife attack against Bolsonaro further complicated he most unpredictable election in three decades, with Brazil's most popular politician, jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, banned from running due to a corruption conviction but keeping up a legal battle to try to overturn that ban. 
Bolsonaro, a former army captain, has for years angered many Brazilians with extreme statements on race, gender and sexual preference, but he is also seen by his many supporters as an outsider who can clean up a corrupt political system. 
Police have a suspect in custody and say only that they are continuing the investigation and that no clear motive was yet known, though the assailant told police he stabbed Bolsonaro on Thursday on ""orders from God."" 
Surveys consistently give Bolsonaro, a member of the Social Liberal Party, around 22 percent in of voter support. However, those polls find he would lose to most rivals in the likely event of a runoff, which takes place if no candidate wins a majority in the first ballot.

Bolsonaro's campaign managers hope that the stabbing will draw sympathy votes that will win him the presidency.

The 2018 elections come at a sensitive time for the Gulf state as the public finances have been hit hard by a slump in oil prices, with Bahrain's dinar plunging to its lowest in more than decade.
Tensions with the Shi'ite Muslim opposition have shown no sign of abating with the United Nations and rights groups accusing the government of crushing dissent.
Last May, Bahrain's parliament approved a bill barring members of dissolved opposition groups from running in elections, the latest step in the political crackdown.
A statement carried by the state news agency BNA called on Bahrainis registered on the 2002 election lists to elect members of the House of Representatives on Nov. 25. 
BNA quoted a royal decree from King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. It also called on candidates running for the House's 40 seats to apply between Oct. 17 and Oct. 21. 
The 2014 elections were boycotted by the Shi'ite opposition over accusations that constituency changes would still favor the Sunni Muslim majority represented by the ruling family.

The Palestinians say the tearing down of Khan al-Ahmar is part of an Israeli plan to create an arc of Jewish settlements that would effectively cut off East Jerusalem from the West Bank - areas Israel captured in a 1967 war and which Palestinians seek for a independent state.
Israel's top court on Wednesday rejected petitions against the demolition of Khan al-Ahmar and said a temporary injunction that had put a hold on the move would lapse in a week.
In a statement, the five European Union powers said, ""We therefore join (EU) High Representative/Vice-President (Federica) Mogherini in reiterating our call to the Israeli government not to go ahead with its plan to demolish the village – including its school – and displace its residents.""
They added, ""The consequences a demolition and displacement would have on the residents of this community, including their children, as well as on the prospects of the two-state solution would be very serious.""
Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Khan al-Ahmar is situated outside Jerusalem between two Israeli settlements.
Khan al-Ahmar was built without Israeli permits, a factor cited prominently in the court's decision. Palestinians say such documents are impossible to obtain.
U.S.-brokered peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been stalled since 2014 and Israeli settlements in the occupied territories have steadily expanded. 
Most countries consider settlements built by Israel on land it took in the 1967 Middle East war as illegal and an obstacle to peace. They say they reduce and fragment the territory Palestinians seek for a viable state.
Israel disputes this and cites biblical, historical and political connections to the land, as well as security needs.
The EU representative office said in July that settlement expansion had continued at a faster rate in the first six months of this year than between July and December 2017, with more than 6,000 housing units in the West Bank including East Jerusalem in different stages of the planning and implementation process.
U.S. President Donald Trump has angered Palestinians and stirred global concern by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital despite its internationally disputed status, and cutting off U.S. aid to the United Nations agency that cares for Palestinian refugees.

LONDON (Reuters) - A man who mowed down pedestrians with a car near Britain's parliament before stabbing a policeman ruined many lives in a matter of seconds, an inquest heard on Monday, as it began with tributes to the victims and details of their last moments. 
On March 22, 2017, Khalid Masood, a 52-year-old British-born convert to Islam, drove along a pavement on Westminster Bridge, killing four people, before stabbing to death an unarmed police officer in the grounds of parliament. He was shot dead at the scene.
It was the first of five attacks in Britain last year that police blamed on terrorism, and coroner Mark Lucraft said the attack had lasted less than two minutes.
""The lives of many were torn apart by 82 seconds of high and terrible drama,"" he told the inquiry.
The inquest, which is expected to last several weeks, will seek to establish the circumstances around the deaths of the four pedestrians and the police officer, Lucraft said.
A separate inquiry into Masood's death will be held later.
The coroner held a minute's silence before hearing testimonials to the victims, and a colleague of the policeman, Keith Palmer, paid tribute to his courage.
""Keith was that brave person who would stand his ground,"" Police Constable Shaun Cartwright said in a statement that was read to the court. ""I'm immensely proud to have called Keith my friend.""
INSTINCTIVE COURAGE
Two of those killed by Masood's rental car, American Kurt Cochran and Romanian Andreea Cristea, were tourists visiting London with their partners.
Stills from closed-circuit TV footage showed Cochran pushing his wife Melissa out of the way of the oncoming vehicle, in what was ""apparently an act of instinctive courage"", the inquiry's lawyer Jonathan Hough said. 
Melissa sustained serious injuries but survived, and said in a statement read by her sister Angela Stoll that her husband's ""heroic actions that fateful day ... saved my life"". 
In testimony from Metropolitan Police officer John Crossley, the inquiry heard that Masood's car may have reached 41 miles (66 km) per hour as it drove along the sidewalk.
""It is my belief that Masood acted alone,"" he told the court. ""He was deliberately targeting pedestrians.""
Several of the victims' relatives temporarily left the court while CCTV footage of the attack was played, after Lucraft warned that the images would be distressing.
Leslie Rhodes, a retired window cleaner, died after being dragged under the car for over 30 meters, the court heard, while Aysha Frade was walking with her back to the car when it knocked her under a bus. 
Her husband John said she had been worried about security after her office moved to the area, but her family had tried to reassure her.

""It causes myself ... excruciating pain to think of Aysha in the past tense,"" he told the inquiry. ""In truth, it still doesn't feel like she has gone.""

The woman, who was not named, said the jewels were taken on Friday afternoon. There were no signs that the room had been broken into, the source said. The woman told prosecutors the belongings were not left in the room's safe.
A spokesman for the Ritz declined to comment.
If confirmed, it would be the second heist from the chic hotel on Paris's Place Vendome this year. 
In January, axe-bearing thieves burst into the lobby and stole millions of dollars worth of necklaces and other jewelry from display cases.
Police managed to catch three of them inside, and two others who escaped on a scooter ended up dropping a bag of their loot. All the jewels were eventually recovered.
Armed thefts are not uncommon in the area, where dozens of luxury boutiques and jewelry stores align the streets. 
In December 2017, a man was able to substitute two diamonds and two rings worth 5.5 million euros in a jewelry store, replacing them with cheap fakes.
In October 2016, reality TV star Kim Kardashian was the victim of a robbery 10 minutes walk from the Ritz, in which millions of dollars' worth of her jewelry were stolen.

Police now keep a permanent presence in the neighborhood, but that has done little to deter determined robbers.

1504,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 11:39AM ET</span>",Sweden faces political impasse after far-right election gains,"By Johan Sennero and Simon Johnson
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden faces a political impasse after its mainstream center-left and center-right blocs virtually tied in an election on Sunday, while the far-right - which neither wants to deal with - made gains on a hardline anti-immigration platform.
With nearly all votes counted on Monday, the ruling center-left Social Democrats and Greens and their Left Party parliamentary ally had 40.6 percent of the vote, while the opposition center-right Alliance was on 40.3 percent.
That translates into a single-seat advantage in the 349-member Riksdag.
The Sweden Democrats, a party with white supremacist roots, won 17.6 percent, about 5 percentage points more than four years ago. It was the biggest gain of any party and in line with conventional opinion polls but fell short of the 20-30 percent their leader Jimmie Akesson had predicted.
Akesson was adamant his party holds the balance of power. ""We won't participate in letting through a government which doesn't give us influence,"" he told TV4. ""On the contrary, we will do what we can to bring down any such government.""
Unless parties on the center-left and center-right break ranks with their blocs, it is likely to be impossible to form a stable government without some kind of support from the Sweden Democrats, who want the country to leave the European Union and freeze immigration.
Yet Akesson's overtures found few takers with a letter inviting the right-wing Moderates and Christian Democrats to talks being instantly, and publicly, rebuffed.
Many online surveys, which in the last election had gauged the Sweden Democrats' vote better than conventional polls, had signaled they could dethrone the Social Democrats as the nation's biggest party - a position the center-left has held for a century.
In the end, the Sweden Democrats were beaten by Prime Minister Stefan Lofven's Social Democrats by a 10 percentage point margin and eclipsed also by the Moderates of Ulf Kristersson, the Alliance's candidate for the premiership.
""In some sense we're happy the Sweden Democrats didn't grow more than they did,"" Liberal Party lawmaker Allan Widman told Reuters. ""The bigger they become, the more hard pressed all other parties become."" 
GRAPHIC - Election result https://tmsnrt.rs/2CDMT4e
SENSE OF RELIEF
The Sweden Democrats' success follows a rise in popularity of other far-right parties in Europe amid growing anxiety over national identity, the effects of globalization and fears over immigration boosted by conflicts in the Middle East and Africa.
Sweden saw itself as a ""humanitarian superpower"" for years, but a rise in gang violence in immigrant-dominated, deprived city suburbs has also won support for the Sweden Democrats.
After the arrival of 163,000 asylum seekers in 2015 - the most in Europe in relation to the country's population of 10 million, the government suspended many of its liberal asylum policies.
There was a sense of relief among supporters of mainstream parties about the far-right's less dramatic gains. That was shared in Brussels. ""It is clear that the claim that the far-right is on an inexorable roll and will devour everything that stands in its way is false,"" said one EU official.
Still, the Swedish election underscored a broader shift to the right in one of Europe's most socially progressive nations.
LENGTHY PROCESS
Senior figures in the mainstream parties headed into meetings on Monday to produce a strategy for forming a government. But the process could take weeks and possibly fail.
Akesson challenged Kristersson to choose between seeking support from the Sweden Democrats for an Alliance government or accepting four more years of Lofven as prime minister.
Kristersson called on Lofven to resign, but also rebuffed Akesson. ""We have been completely clear during the whole election. The Alliance will not govern or discuss how to form a government with the Sweden Democrats,"" he said.
Both sides laid claim to being best placed to form a government, although votes from Swedes living abroad are not due to be declared until Wednesday and these could still sway the final outcome slightly.
Yet in the same breath, leaders of both sides called for bipartisan accommodation to avoid gridlock in parliament.
The scenario of a bipartisan coalition is highly uncertain.
Center-left and center-right parties have ruled together only a handful of times since the mid-1930s. Also, a 2014 accord to neutralize the Sweden Democrats and let the biggest bloc rule proved deeply unpopular among center-right grassroot members and rapidly unraveled. 
The Moderates - the biggest party in the Alliance - are not interested in cooperating with the Social Democrats and any such deal would also raise questions about democratic accountability. Voters might see the Sweden Democrats as the country's only opposition party.

A new election will be called if parliament doesn't agree on a prime minister after four attempts.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan will form a new government within two days, President Omar al-Bashir said on Monday, a day after he dissolved the cash-strapped administration and slashed the number of ministries by a third to tackle a deepening economic crisis.
Sudan has been looking to cut down spending as it grapples with a crisis-ridden economy battered in recent months by shortages of hard currency and staples like fuel and bread.
After an emergency ruling party meeting to discuss the economy on Sunday, Bashir named a new prime minister, Motazz Moussa, and asked him to form a tighter government of 21 ministers instead of 31 as part of efforts to cut costs.
Speaking on state television on Monday, Bashir said the new government would look to slash government spending ""to a minimum"" but did not specify the nature of the cuts.
""Within the next two days a national reconciliation government will be formed to implement a program to reduce government spending, reform the civil service, eradicate all forms of corruption, and provide an attractive environment for investment,"" the longtime president said.
The ministries to be shelved have not yet been announced, but a ruling party official said on Sunday that the ministers of foreign affairs, defense and presidential affairs would remain in their posts.
Sudan's decision to reduce bread subsidies earlier this year triggered rare nationwide protests after bread prices doubled. 
A severe shortage of hard currency in the formal banking system has led to a booming black market for dollars where the hard currency currently trades for a roughly 40 percent premium.
This premium has hiked the cost of imports and helped push inflation to about 64 percent in July.
In recent months liquidity of local currency at commercial banks has also dried up, with long queues outside of banks and daily withdrawal limits falling to as low as 500 Sudanese pounds ($17.06) in some places.
Sudan's economy has been struggling since the south of the sprawling northeast African country seceded in 2011, taking with it three-quarters of oil output and depriving Khartoum of a crucial source of foreign currency. 

Bashir, who has ruled since a 1989 Islamist and military-backed coup, has said he will not stand in elections expected in 2020 and appointed a prime minister last year for the first time.

1508,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",Dozens killed in heavy fighting in northern Afghanistan,"KABUL (Reuters) - Security forces clashed with Taliban fighters in key locations in northern Afghanistan on Monday, with dozens of people killed and the city of Sar-e Pul threatened by insurgents, officials said.
Fighting has raged around the provincial capital of Sar-e Pul for two days and at least 17 members of the security forces have been killed in the past 24 hours, according to the provincial governor's spokesman Zabihullah Amani.
He said the figure was provisional and the real number of casualties may be higher.
The increasingly fragile situation in the north presents a major early challenge to Gen. Scott Miller, the new commander of U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan, who took up his post earlier this month.
U.S. officials have pressed for talks with the Taliban and recently appointed former ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad as special representative to try to push the peace process forward.
Last month, Taliban forces briefly overran the strategic city of Ghazni, on the main highway between Kabul and southern Afghanistan, and the latest incidents point to continued heavy fighting, dampening hopes for peace talks.
The Taliban's main spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said fighters had overrun checkpoints no more than five km (three miles) from Sar-e Pul city center and seized a large quantity of weapons and equipment.
Amani said fighting was under way on the main highway into neighboring Jawzjan province, at a point around 20 km from the city, while another group of Taliban forces appeared to be gathering in Sheram area, around 3-4 km to the east of the city center.
Security forces, backed by strikes from the Afghan air force, had killed at least 39 Taliban, who had sent in fighters from neighboring provinces to reinforce local forces, he said.
The badly stretched Afghan security forces have suffered tens of thousands of casualties since most international forces ended combat operations in 2014, and the insurgents control large parts of the countryside.
In Jawzjan province, on the northwestern border with Turkemenistan, at least eight members of the security forces were killed in Kham Ab district and 13 wounded. In Samargan province, at least 14 police and civilians were killed in fighting in Dara-e Suf-e Payin district.
In Kunduz province, 15 police were killed and 10 others wounded in attacks on security checkpoints in Dasht-e Archi district overnight, said Amruddin Wali, a member of the local provincial council.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish political parties face weeks of haggling to form a government after voters delivered a hung parliament on Sunday, with the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats saying they hold the balance of power.
A preliminary allocation of parliamentary seats gave the center-left bloc - uniting the minority governing Social Democrat and Green parties with the Left Party - 144 seats versus 143 for the center-right Alliance bloc.
The Sweden Democrats, who want to leave the European Union, won 62 seats, up from 49 in the 349-seat Riksdag where 175 seats are needed to form a majority.
Doing a deal with them would give either bloc a majority but the mainstream parties have ruled out cooperating with a party which has roots in the white supremacist fringe.
Both blocs have declared themselves victors in the election, but need additional support to form a viable government without the Sweden Democrats, who want influence over immigration policy. 
There are a number of ways out of the tangle.
Election results graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2CDMT4e
CENTER-RIGHT MINORITY RULE 
The Alliance of the Moderates, Centre, Liberals and Christian Democrats looks set to be slightly smaller than the center-left. But it will hope for backing from the Sweden Democrats to oust Prime Minister Stefan Lofven and to install Moderate leader Ulf Kristersson as his replacement. 
However, a formal agreement with the Sweden Democrats would very likely see the Centre and Liberal parties, who want looser immigration policies, jump ship.
It is not clear whether the Centre and Liberal parties would take part in a government that had no formal support from the Sweden Democrats but in practice relied on their votes to install a prime minister. 
On Monday, Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie Akesson invited the Moderates and Christian Democrats to formal negotiations but was quickly rebuffed. 
Akesson said his party would vote against any government that did not give it a say in policy.
SOCIAL DEMOCRATS AND GREENS CLING ON
The Social Democrats and Greens could retain power in the unlikely event that Prime Minister Lofven survives a mandatory vote on whether to replace him.
Lofven said he would remain in office in the coming weeks and called for cooperation across the political divide.
When voting for a prime minister in parliament, a proposal is passed unless a majority of all 349 lawmakers vote against. This has allowed minority governments to rule.
The Alliance would need the Sweden Democrats to back a vote to oust Lofven and install Kristersson. 
A GRAND COALITION
The Alliance could join a grand coalition with the Social Democrats and possibly the Greens to exclude the Sweden Democrats. The Left Party, Sweden's former Communist party, would also be left out. 
But the Moderates - the biggest party in the Alliance - are not interested in cooperating with the Social Democrats and such a deal would also raise questions about democratic accountability. Voters might see the Sweden Democrats as the country's only opposition party. 
MODERATE ONE-PARTY RULE 
The Moderates could form a one-party government but that would require support from the Sweden Democrats as well as the smaller center-right parties. 
Moderate leader Kristersson has ruled this out, and the Centre and Liberal parties would probably not go along with the idea if the Sweden Democrats were given any significant say over policy while remaining outside the government. 
NEW VOTE 
Parliament opens on Sept. 25. If Lofven is ousted, the speaker is allowed to give a maximum of four prime ministerial candidates the opportunity to form a government. If they all fail, fresh elections must be called. There is no formal time limit for negotiations, but the deadline for the budget is Nov. 15. 

If no new government is in place by then, the current government, continuing as caretakers, would put forward a budget until a new cabinet can take office.

GENEVA (Reuters) - U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet called on China on Monday to allow in monitors after ""deeply disturbing"" allegations of large re-education camps in which Uighurs are detained in Xinjiang province.
Her appeal for access came as Human Rights Watch reported that the Turkic, mostly Muslim Uighur minority in Xinjiang face arbitrary detentions, daily restrictions on religious practice and ""forced political indoctrination"" in a mass security crackdown.
A United Nations rights panel said last month it had received credible reports that up to one million Uighurs may be held in extra-legal detention in the far western province of China, and called for them to be freed.
China has rejected the allegations of internment camps and accused ""external factors"" of causing turbulence in the restive region.
Bachelet, a former Chilean president making her maiden speech to the U.N. Human Rights Council, said the panel had brought to light ""deeply disturbing allegations of large-scale arbitrary detentions of Uighurs and other Muslim communities, in so-called re-education camps across Xinjiang"". 
Reports had been received of ""patterns of human rights violations in other regions"", she said. Bachelet called on the Beijing government to permit access for her staff across China, saying that she expected discussions to start soon.
There was no immediate comment from the Chinese delegation to the council. Countries are due to respond to her speech on Tuesday. 
Bachelet promised to be a voice for victims. ""I have been a political detainee and the daughter of political detainees. I have been a refugee and a physician – including for children who experienced torture and the enforced disappearance of their parents,"" she told the 47-member forum in Geneva. 
Bachelet voiced concern that 500 migrant children in the United States taken away from their parents have not yet been returned by authorities. She decried the announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration last week that it would withdraw from a court agreement limiting detention of migrant children to 20 days.
She urged the Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen to show greater transparency in its rules of engagement and hold to account perpetrators of air strikes on civilians, including one that hit a bus killing dozens of children in Saada last month.
""I will be closely following what steps are taken to hold the perpetrators accountable and provide remedy and compensation to the victims,"" she said. 
Independent rights investigators reported last month that some coalition air strikes in Yemen may amount to war crimes.
The investigators gave her a confidential list of suspects linked to international crimes in the conflict, Bachelet said. 

""The recent Saudi royal order which appears to provide a blanket pardon to members of the Saudi armed forces for actions taken in Yemen is very concerning,"" she said.

Jakub Fabian Skrzypski was detained on Aug. 26 and is being held at police headquarters in the eastern province of Papua where he has been charged along with three Papuans under the law governing treason, which carries a maximum sentence of life in jail.
""He has been charged with treason,"" Papua police spokesman Ahmad Musthofa Kamal said.
Police allege that Skrzypski, who entered the country on a tourist visa, discussed an arms deal in a meeting with a separatist leader, who is based in neighboring Papua New Guinea and has not been detained.
Police had evidence from witnesses and mobile phone messages and they had also found video showing Skrzypski participating in shooting practice, the spokesman said. 
Papua, one of Indonesia's poorest provinces has battled a long-running separatist movement since it was incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticized U.N.-backed referendum in 1969 and it remains the country’s most heavily militarised region.
The Polish embassy in Jakarta did not respond to a request for comment.

VLADIVOSTOK, Russia/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's ruling United Russia Party suffered a rare setback in regional elections despite winning most of the seats, a reversal its leaders and election chiefs blamed on unpopular plans to raise the pension age.
The results in weekend voting for heads of about one third of Russia's regions were the worst for United Russia, which backs President Vladimir Putin, since elections for regional leaders were re-introduced in 2012. 
Four Kremlin-backed candidates were forced into run-off votes. Two were beaten into second place -- by a communist and a nationalist -- and two finished first but failed to win the more than 50 percent of votes needed for outright victory. 
Opponents of the pension reforms, which envisage raising the retirement age for men to 65 from 60 and to 60 from 55 for women, staged protests across Russia as voting took place.
Police detained just over 1,000 people, OVD-Info, a rights organization that monitors detentions, said. Jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny had called for the protests. 
Ella Pamfilova, the head of the Central Election Commission, said it was obvious the planned pension changes had prompted voters to register their discontent at the ballot box, something she said was a sign of genuine political competition.
""It's a good lesson for everyone,"" she told a news conference. ""It's very useful for the party of power to get a bit of a jolt."" 
Speaking in the far eastern city of Vladivostok, Putin told government officials he was unfazed by the fact that re-runs would be needed in four regions. 
""It's an absolutely normal phenomenon,"" he said.
The region the includes Vladivistok is one of those where a second vote will be required. The man Putin appointed acting governor there last year failed to pass the 50-percent threshold on Sunday after a communist won almost a quarter of the votes.
""You don't need to hunt for complex explanations as to why this happened,"" said Ivan, a voter in Vladivostok who declined to give his surname. ""Everything can be explained by the fall in the authorities' popularity because of pension reform.""
United Russia also lost ground to the Communist Party and the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR) in some areas in weekend elections to regional parliaments.
The proposed pension changes, which are being considered by the national parliament, have shaved about 15 percentage points off Putin's popularity rating, opinion polls show, although his ratings remain high. 
They are the most unpopular government measure since a 2005 move to scrap Soviet-era benefits, though Putin amended the planned reforms after initial protests. Average life expectancy for men in Russia is 66 and for women 77.
""DIFFICULT CONDITIONS""
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, the leader of United Russia and a Putin ally, told party activists on Sunday night he deemed the results ""worthy"" given the election campaign had taken place in what he called difficult conditions.
""... There's a heated public discussion in society right now about a whole raft of changes, including changes to pension law. That undoubtedly ratcheted up the intensity of the campaign and of the political battle,"" Medvedev said.
In Moscow, Putin's former chief-of-staff Sergei Sobyanin was re-elected mayor with about 70 percent of the votes. But despite a huge get-out-the-vote campaign, turnout was just 30 percent as many Muscovites stayed away. That was less than the turnout at the previous mayoral election in 2013. 
Putin was in Vladivostok on Monday to meet Asian leaders at an economic forum.
Vladivostok resident Alexei, 41, who works in the local ship building industry, said he had voted for the communist candidate as a protest vote and planned to do the same in the run-off.
""We really don't like United Russia here and Putin and his comrades at the moment,"" he said. 

United Russia remained the dominant force in the national parliament in the last election in 2016. The next is due in 2021.

Abdul Razak Dawood, the Pakistani cabinet member for commerce, industry and investment, suggested that all projects in the $57-billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor program could be eligible for suspension in a review to be conducted this week under the orders of new Prime Minister Imran Khan.
""I think we should put everything on hold for a year, so we can get our act together,"" Dawood told the Financial Times in an interview. ""Perhaps we can stretch CPEC out over another five years or so.""
He added that he thought China had been granted too-favorable terms in many projects by the former government of Nawaz Sharif.
""Chinese companies received tax breaks, many breaks and have an undue advantage in Pakistan; this is one of the things we're looking at because it's not fair that Pakistan companies should be disadvantaged,"" Dawood said.
Pakistani markets fell in early trading on Monday, with the benchmark KSE 100 index down 477.38 just after midday at 40,374 points, before recovering to close at 40,684, still down 0.4 percent.
Dawood's comments were ""mind-boggling"" and rare public criticism of China, said Mohammad Zubair, privatization minister in the previous government.
""This is probably the harshest statement about the Chinese in the last 50 years or so,"" Zubair told Reuters. ""Even if there are issues with the Chinese, those issues could be dealt with in private rather than being made public.""
Later on Monday, Dawood told domestic broadcaster Geo TV that his statements had been misconstrued and he would clarify them later.
The critical comments were published just after the Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, visited Pakistan and the two sides reaffirmed the mutual benefits of the Beijing-funded projects.
While Khan, a former cricket star, has made no secret he plans to review all government projects and expenditure, the finance ministry last month said Pakistan was ""fully committed to undertake and complete CPEC projects in their totality"".
Pakistan is struggling to avert a foreign currency crisis that could force it to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. Its foreign currency reserves have dwindled to $9.9 billion last month from around $16 billion in mid-2017.
The rupee has been devalued four times since late last year, falling by more than 20 percent.

In June, Beijing gave Pakistan $1 billion in loans to boost foreign reserves ahead of the July 25 election.

Hanoi will host the World Economic Forum on the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) from Tuesday to Thursday, an event touted as the country's biggest diplomatic gathering this year.
Amnesty condemned the decision to block the entry of Minar Pimple, its senior director of global operations, adding that the step came at a time when freedom of expression was under threat in Vietnam.
""The government's actions undermine an event that depends on a plurality of views, and they are giving ASEAN a bad name,"" Amnesty's secretary general, Kumi Naidoo, said in a statement posted on its website.
""We condemn this decision to stifle debate from a regular contributor to the WEF, who has spoken at the highest levels on human rights issues around the world."" 
An earlier event program showed Pimple was to have spoken as part of a panel called ""ASEAN Pluralism: Under Threat?""
Vietnam's Foreign Ministry did not immediately comment on the issue.
A spokeswoman for the World Economic Forum said it had been informed that Vietnam had denied Pimple's request for a visa.

Duque, who took office last month, has said the group must free a total of 19 hostages before peace talks begun by his predecessor in 2017 can resume. He said at his Aug. 7 inauguration he would take 30 days to evaluate whether to continue the negotiations, but has yet to announce a final decision.
The Marxist National Liberation Army (ELN) released three soldiers last week in eastern Arauca province, but is believed to be holding another six security force members in Choco province on the Pacific, as well as 10 civilians. 
The liberation of hostages is not one of the pre-conditions for talks agreed at the start of negotiations, the ELN said, nor is the concentration of rebel forces in a single area, which Duque has also repeatedly floated as a condition of further dialogue.
""By not recognizing the deals made with the state and adding, unilaterally, unacceptable conditions, this government is closing the negotiating table, ending the process of dialogue and the efforts made over several years by the ELN, society, the previous government and the international community,"" the group said in a statement posted on its website.
The ELN is committed to liberating the remaining hostages, the statement added, despite military involvement it said had complicated the hand-over of hostages.
""As soon as we find a way to overcome the intense military operations in Choco, we will achieve these liberations,"" the rebels said.

The government's High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos told local Caracol Radio that the previous government of former president Juan Manuel Santos had also required hostage liberations from the ELN. He added that Duque's government will not allow violence to be used as a political tool.

More than a dozen police cars and a helicopter pursued the fugitive over a distance up the wrong side of a motorway before he broke through security barriers at the Lyon-Saint-Exupery international airport. 
""Pursued by police, he smashed through Terminal 1 before reaching the runway area,"" the government prefect's office said in a statement.

More than 300 people have been killed and 2,000 injured in crackdowns by Nicaraguan police and armed groups in protests that began in April over an abortive plan by leftist Ortega's government to reduce welfare benefits.
The United States on Sept. 5 declared Nicaragua's civil unrest a threat to the region's security, saying government repression of protests risked creating an overwhelming displacement of people akin to Venezuela or Syria.
""We are under threat,"" Ortega told France 24 TV in an interview being broadcast on Monday. ""We can't rule out anything out as far as the U.S. is concerned. We can't rule out a military intervention,"" he said.
An advance copy of the interview was given to Reuters by the news TV channel. 
U.S. government officials were not immediately available to respond to Ortega's comments.
April's protests escalated into broader opposition against Ortega, who has been in office since 2007. He also served as president in the 1980s when he was a notable Cold War antagonist of the United States during Nicaragua's civil war.
Accusing the U.S. of training armed groups to stoke trouble in his country, Ortega reiterated that early elections would be detrimental to Nicaragua. The next presidential vote is due in late 2020.
Ortea said he would be prepared to meet Trump if it could be arranged.
""The idea of having a dialogue with a power like the U.S. is necessary,"" said Ortega, interviewed in Spanish with English translation. ""It could be an opportunity (to meet Trump) at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). I'd like to go.""
The annual gathering of world leaders starts on Sept. 24 at the U.N.'s headquarters in New York.
Ortega said he was keen to restart dialogue with his opponents and had approached Spain and Germany to help play a role.
The current violence comes after years of calm in Nicaragua and is the worst since his Sandinista movement battled U.S.-backed ""Contra"" rebels in the 1980s.

Washington has blamed Ortega, a former Marxist guerrilla leader, and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, for the situation. The U.S. has also imposed sanctions against three top Nicaraguan officials, citing human rights abuses.

MUNICH (Reuters) - The head of Germany's domestic spy agency must explain why he cast doubt on the authenticity of videos showing far-right gangs hounding migrants in an eastern city, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said on Monday.
BfV head Hans-Georg Maassen has faced calls to resign from across the mainstream political spectrum after he said he was not sure if footage circulated online showing skinheads chasing foreigners in Chemnitz were authentic.
Violent protests in the city last month by far-right groups over the fatal stabbing of a German man blamed on two migrants have widened already deep social divisions that were exposed by Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision in 2015 to open Germany's borders to more than one million migrants.
Seehofer heads the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU) party, which is generally further right on social issues than its alliance partner, Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU).
He has been criticized for saying he would have joined in the Chemnitz protests, albeit not with far-right groups.
But on Monday he took a more conciliatory line.
""We are waiting to see what he has to report to us,"" he told reporters when asked if Maassen could remain as BfV chief. ""Everything else will be dealt with then.""
Seehofer also urged caution over the arrest of two Afghans following the death at the weekend of a German man in the eastern city of Koethen, where far-right and left-wing protesters held rival demonstrations.
""We need to do everything to overcome what is happening in our country: terrible anti-Semitic incidents, far-right radicalism but also crimes by migrants. We need to face all those challenges,"" Seehofer said. 
Anne-Marie Keding, justice minister of Saxony-Anhalt where Koethen lies, said an initial autopsy showed the 22-year-old man had died of a heart condition.
Its interior minister Holger Stahlknecht urged participants at a wreath-laying ceremony for the man on Monday evening to behave ""reasonably"". 
The BfV has presented its report on events in Chemnitz to Seehofer and Merkel.
Merkel rebuked the premier of Saxony, the state where Chemnitz is situated, after he said no mobs hunted down migrants in the city, where a Jewish restaurant was also attacked.
Seehofer noted the Saxony premier's comments, and said police and the spy agency chief had reached the same conclusion.

""The second thing is the veracity of the videos. Mr Maassen has said he doubts the videos are real. He must have reasons to reach this conclusion,"" the minister said.

1524,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 06:55AM ET</span>",UK PM's Brexit plans opposed by 80 rebels in her party: former minister,"By Guy Faulconbridge
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party faces a ""catastrophic split"" if she persists with her proposals on Brexit, which 80 or more of her lawmakers are prepared to vote against, a former junior minister said.
Such public criticism, a day after former foreign minister Boris Johnson cast her Brexit plans as ""a suicide vest"" wrapped around the British constitution indicates how hard it could be for May to get any Brexit deal approved.
Steve Baker, a former junior Brexit minister who resigned over May's so-called Chequers proposals on Brexit, told the Press Association he was not advocating a change of leader but warned May faced a massive problem at the Sept. 30-Oct. 3 party conference.
If 80 of May's 315 lawmakers voted against a Brexit deal based on her proposals the fate of the government and Brexit would depend on the Labour Party because she would not command the 320 votes in the 650-seat parliament necessary.
""If we come out of conference with her hoping to get Chequers through on the back of Labour votes, I think the EU negotiators would probably understand that if that were done, the Tory party would suffer the catastrophic split which thus far we have managed to avoid,"" Baker was quoted as saying.
Other Conservatives have given much more modest estimates of the number of lawmakers who oppose her plans. While some Brexiteers are unhappy with her premiership they see May as their best immediate hope of ensuring the UK leaves the EU.
The United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29, yet little is clear. There is, so far, no full exit deal and it is unclear whether May can push an agreement through the British parliament.
""CATASTROPHIC SPLIT""
Divisions in the Conservative Party over Britain's relationship with the EU contributed to the fall of all three previous Conservative premiers - David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher.
While the EU in recent weeks has given signs it is seeking to ease May into a deal by offering compromises, she is facing an increasingly vociferous group of committed Brexiteers who feel she has been far too weak with the EU.
In an article in the Mail on Sunday newspaper, Johnson pressed his attack on May's Chequers plan to leave the EU, calling it ""a humiliation"" that opens ""ourselves to perpetual political blackmail"".
May is under fire from all sides of the Brexit debate, with Johnson, favorite to succeed her, leading a push by euroskeptic lawmakers for the government to ""chuck Chequers"" and pursue a clean break with the bloc.
Baker said May should seek a Free Trade Agreement under the terms placed on the table by European Council president Donald Tusk in March, PA reported.
He said it would be ""fanciful"" to expect her to secure parliamentary approval for Chequers.
""It is absolutely no pleasure whatsoever to me to acknowledge that, but I look at the mood of colleagues and the mood of the Conservative party in the country and I am gravely concerned for the future of our party,"" Baker said.
London and Brussels say they want to get a divorce deal at the Oct. 18 EU Council or at the latest by the end of the year. 
Any deal with the EU must be approved by the British parliament, which is due to go on Christmas holiday from Dec. 20 to Jan. 7. If British lawmakers reject a deal in late December or early January, Britain would face the prospect of leaving the EU three months later without an agreement.
Without a deal, the UK would move from seamless trade with the rest of the European Union to customs arrangements set by the World Trade Organization for external states with no preferential deals.
Some business leaders have warned that adding just two minutes onto every lorry’s customs procedure passing through the southern English port of Dover would produce a 14-mile tailback on either side of the Channel after one day.
Supporters of Brexit admit there may be some short-term pain for the UK’s $2.9 trillion economy but long-term it will prosper when cut free from the EU which they cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration.

1526,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",UK government refuses to say if it has taken legal advice on second Brexit referendum,"By Kylie MacLellan
LONDON (Reuters) - The British government has refused to confirm whether it has taken legal advice on holding a second referendum on the final Brexit deal, saying revealing such information would harm its negotiating position in talks with Brussels.
The Brexit department, which oversees the negotiations on Britain's departure from the European Union next year, made the comment in response to a Reuters query submitted under the Freedom of Information law.
With less than seven months until Brexit day and Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plans under fire, some lawmakers and business leaders are increasingly arguing for people to have a final say on any deal with Brussels.
May has repeatedly ruled out holding a second referendum following the vote two years ago to leave the EU. However, several lawmakers in her Conservative Party back the idea of what is known as a ""people's vote"", and opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is under pressure to voice his support. 
Britain's Trades Union Congress, a group of 48 labor unions, added to the pressure on Sunday, with General Secretary Frances O'Grady saying it would back a referendum if May fails to get a deal that will support workers. 
Asked by Reuters what legal advice it had received this year on holding a second referendum, the Brexit department said there was a public interest in refusing to confirm or deny whether it had such information.
""There is a very strong public interest in the most effective pursuance of the UK’s national interests abroad,"" the department said in a letter. 
""It is necessary to consider whether the act of confirming or denying whether we hold information ... would be likely to prejudice the government's negotiating position, which would be detrimental to the UK’s relationships with other states, and with European institutions, and would prejudice the promotion and protection of the UK’s interests abroad.""
The department said it had concluded ""the public interest favors maintaining the exclusion"" of its duty to reveal whether or not it holds such information.
It gave the same answer to a request for information on whether it had taken legal advice on the reversibility of Article 50, the notice of the intention to leave the EU. 
Brexit minister Dominic Raab said last week that the prospect of a second referendum would invite Brussels to offer Britain the ""very worst terms"" in any Brexit deal. 
Britain is due to leave the EU on March 29 but has yet to reach a deal with Brussels on the terms of its departure. May has said members of parliament will get to vote on whether to accept any final deal.
In the June 2016 referendum 51.9 percent backed leaving the EU, while 48.1 percent favored staying. Opinion polls show Britons remain divided over Brexit, though some recent surveys have shown a swing towards support for staying in the EU.

A YouGov poll, conducted July 31-Aug. 7 and commissioned by the pro-referendum ""People's Vote"" campaign, found 45 percent of voters supported holding a new referendum whatever the outcome of talks with the EU, while 34 percent opposed it.

The world's top oil exporter is pushing a host of economic and social reforms, including ending a ban on women driving and opening up new sectors for women, in a bid to end dependency on crude revenues. But some conservative traditions have not been as quick to change in the deeply religious Muslim kingdom.
In footage shared widely on social media, the pair eat breakfast at a desk and wave at the camera. At one point the woman, wearing a traditional black robe covering all but her hands and eyes, feeds the man a piece of food.
A labor ministry statement on Sunday said an inspection team had visited the unidentified hotel in the western city of Mecca and detained the Egyptian for violations including working in a profession restricted to Saudis, without providing details.
The hotel owner was also summoned ""for failing to adhere to spatial controls for employing women"", the statement added.
Government regulations stipulate that workplaces should ensure a private setting for female employees separate from males, but in practice this is not uniformly applied.

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Several armed men attacked the headquarters of the National Oil Corporation (NOC) in the Libyan capital on Monday and blasts were heard before wounded people were ferried away from the building in ambulances, a Reuters witness said.
The attack came less than a week after a fragile truce suspended fierce clashes between rival armed groups in Tripoli, the latest eruption of violence in Libya, which has been in turmoil since a 2011 uprising. 
No group immediately claimed responsibility for Monday's attack. Militants loyal to Islamic State have previously carried out attacks in Tripoli and other Libyan towns and cities.
Gunfire rang out as security forces allied to the Tripoli-based government arrived at the large glass-fronted office complex located in central Tripoli.
""Three or five gunmen were shooting inside the building,"" an NOC member of staff told Reuters after he said he had jumped out of a window to flee. ""Several people were shot.""
Security force were smashing windows so staff could escape and several people were hurt by shattered glass, witnesses said. NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla and his office manager could be seen safely leaving the building.
Smoke rose into the air as the security forces took up their positions, and surrounding roads were cordoned off.
A member of staff from a hotel next to the NOC offices said he had heard about five blasts.
Libya has been divided between rival governments and military factions based in the east and west of the country since 2014, causing political deadlock and an economic crisis. 
However, the NOC has continued to function relatively normally across Libya, which relies on oil exports for most of its income.
Oil production has been hit by attacks on oil facilities and blockades, though last year it partially recovered to around one million barrels per day (bpd).
Islamist militants have sleeper cells in northern cities as well as operating mobile units in Libya's southern desert, according to Libyan and Western officials. 

In May, Islamic State claimed a deadly attack on the national election commission offices in Tripoli. The group also claimed an attack in 2015 on the Corinthia hotel, a landmark location in Tripoli.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - A suicide car bomb rammed into a local government office in Somalia's capital on Monday, killing at least six people in an attack claimed by al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab.
A loud blast destroyed the office in Mogadishu's Hodan district and sent up huge clouds of smoke. A Reuters reporter saw five bodies and the body parts of a sixth person.
""We have carried six dead people and 16 others injured. The death toll may rise,"" Abdikadir Abdirahman, director of Amin Ambulance service, told Reuters.
Al Shabaab - which is fighting to topple the government and establish its own rule based on its interpretation of Islamic law - said it was behind the attack.
""We completely destroyed the district headquarter office. There are many casualties. We shall give details later,"" Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaab's military operation spokesman, said.
The Islamist militant group has frequently carry out attacks in the capital and other areas since the army, backed by African peacekeepers, pushed it out of the capital in 2011. 
Witness Hussein Osman said he saw a 4x4 vehicle run into the building. 
""I was just outside the district office ... I ran away and now I see from far the office completely destroyed,"" he added.
Last week, a suicide car bomb destroyed another district office in Mogadishu.

SPD leader Andrea Nahles issued a terse statement after the Bild newspaper reported that Germany's conservative-led defense ministry was examining possible options for joining U.S., British and French forces in any future military action if the Syrian government again used chemical weapons.
""The SPD will not agree - either in parliament or in the government - to the participation of Germany in the war in Syria,"" Nahles said. ""We support the foreign minister in his efforts to avert a humanitarian crisis through discussions with Turkey and Russia.""
Bild reported on Monday that a senior German defense official had met the newly arrived U.S. defense attache last month to discuss possible German support for a military alliance against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Russian and Syrian jets and helicopters on Sunday resumed intensive strikes in Idlib and Hama as Damascus stepped up its assault on the last major stronghold of rebel forces.
Bild said German and U.S. officials had discussed various options, including the possibility that German fighter jets could help with battle damage assessments, or drop bombs for the first time since the war in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
SENSITIVE ISSUE 
German participation in any military action remains a sensitive and deeply unpopular topic given the country's Nazi past. Participation in any military strikes in Syria would also put Germany on a direct collision course with Assad's main backer, Russia, for the first time.
Bild said a decision on whether to participate in such strikes would be made by Merkel, who had ruled out joining April 2018 air strikes against Syria by U.S., French and British forces after a previous use of chemical weapons.
It said participation in military action would be notified to parliament after the fact, if speedy action were required. 
The German foreign and defense ministries, in a joint statement, said they were in close touch with U.S. and European allies about the current situation in Syria, potential crisis scenarios and options for joint action.
""The goal is that the conflict parties ... avoid escalating an already terrible situation ... That is particularly true for the use of banned chemical weapons which the Assad government has already used in the past,"" it said.

Previous legal challenges to overturn the ban failed but a prominent Singapore diplomat called on the gay community to renew legal action against the law, a day after India's top court decriminalized gay sex in a landmark ruling.
Fifty-five percent of 750 Singaporeans surveyed by independent market research and consulting firm, Ipsos
still supported the ban.
The Ipsos poll 12 percent opposed the law, while 33 percent were neither for or against it. 
Ipsos conducted the online poll of people aged between 15-65 years over four days in late July and early August. 
Under Section 377A of Singapore's Penal Code, a man found to have committed an act of ""gross indecency"" with another man could be jailed for up to two years, although prosecutions are rare. The law does not apply to homosexual acts between women.
During its six decades since independence, Singapore has emerged as a modern, wealthy city state.
Yet, lawmakers remain typically cautious over social reforms, partly due to sensitivities stemming from the ethnic and religious mix among Singapore's 5.6 million inhabitants - a population that includes citizens, permanent residents and foreigners
An Ipsos spokeswoman said its survey had not been commissioned, but was undertaken to mark the 10th anniversary of Singapore's annual LGBT pride parade, Pink Dot, an event that draws thousands of people.
Last week, Tommy Koh, a veteran diplomat and lawyer, called on the Singapore gay community to bring a class action and challenge the law.
Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam said the issue was up to the Singapore society to decide but the majority of Singaporeans were opposed to any change to the law, adding that ""a growing minority want it to be repealed."" 
Robert McPhedran, Ipsos associate research director in Singapore, said research showed ""the normative values of Singaporeans with respect to LGBTQ issues are gradually shifting."" 
""As has occurred in other countries globally, increased dialogue regarding same-sex relationships has contributed to higher acceptance among Singaporeans,"" McPhedran added. 
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has previously said that Singapore society ""is not that liberal on these matters"". 

""Nonetheless, as PM Lee has previously noted, a social consensus remains far from being reached,” McPhedran said.

1534,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 10, 2018 05:07AM ET</span>",Afghan media under pressure after journalist deaths,"KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan media are facing growing pressure to cut back coverage of militant attacks following the death of two television reporters who were among 20 killed in an attack on a sports club in Kabul last week.
Following an explosion in April that killed nine reporters, photographers and cameramen covering an attack, Afghanistan has been the deadliest country in the world for journalists this year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
On Wednesday, Samim Faramarz, a reporter for Tolo News, and cameraman Ramiz Ahmadi were killed by a car bomb apparently targeting first responders and journalists as they were covering a suicide attack at a wrestling club in Kabul. 
Their deaths came two and a half years after seven Tolo TV employees were killed by a Taliban suicide attacker who rammed a car bomb into a bus driving them home from the station. 
Media coverage of attacks had already been noticeably reduced following the deadly blast in April and last week's incident is likely to restrict coverage further, said Lotfullah Najafizada, head of Tolo News.
""The space is shrinking,"" he told Reuters. ""We have lost colleagues in four separate attacks in two years alone. That demonstrates that the media is under immense pressure.""
Afghanistan's vibrant media sector has been one of the comparatively few undisputed success stories in the years following the overthrow of the Taliban, with the appearance of stations like Tolo as well as an array of competitors including 1TV, Ariana News, Shamshad TV and Khurshid TV.
With international media presence in Afghanistan sharply reduced since the withdrawal of international troops in 2014, domestic media outlets have filled the gap but their work has become increasingly difficult. 
""You have a lot of no-go areas, there is a long list of things you cannot do,"" Najafizada said. 
Already large parts of the countryside, much of which is under the control of the Taliban, are out of bounds for journalists, who have been regarded with suspicion and sometimes outright hostility by the insurgents.
As the major cities still controlled by the government become increasingly dangerous, there would be more restrictions on coverage, less access and less support, he said.
""This is certainly creating another layer of restrictions for a free press which is worrying.""
For the journalists and media workers themselves, the growing roll call of colleagues killed while working is an increasingly oppressive fact of life.
""It has been proved to the world that Afghanistan is not a safe place for people of Afghanistan and for journalists,"" said Soraya Amiri, a Tolo News producer. 

""This is a clear and bitter fact that we have to believe and accept.""

Mirziyoyev, who came to power in 2016, has relaxed restrictions on religious freedoms as part of his campaign of liberal economic and political reforms in the former Soviet republic of 32 million.
But his government stopped short of lifting a decades-long ban on religious clothes and attributes, and specifically barred female students from wearing headscarves known as hijabs in schools by a decree issued last month.
The move prompted criticism on social networks led by Fazliddin Parpiyev, then imam of the Omina mosque in Tashkent. He published a video address to Mirziyoyev on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) last week, an unusual move for an Uzbek cleric.
Parpiyev, 32, said in the video that despite the recent reforms Muslims were still being oppressed over the hijab and beard issue and asked Mirziyoyev for help ""in maintaining freedom of conscience"".
On Sunday, Parpiyev wrote on his Facebook page he had been dismissed from his post by the Muslim Board of Uzbekistan, which is close to the government, and that some fellow clerics have urged him to disavow his previous statement.
""I do not regret what I have said in my video address,"" he wrote. ""However, my smartphone has been taken away from me by my father which gives me reasons to believe that he could be under pressure as well.""

The United Nations human rights panel said in August that China is believed to be holding up to 1 million ethnic Uighurs in a secretive system of ""internment camps"" in Xinjiang, in China's far west, where they undergo political education.
Beijing has denied that such camps are for ""political education"" and says they are instead vocational training centers, part of government initiatives to bolster economic growth and social mobility in the region.
China has said that Xinjiang faces a serious threat from Islamist militants and separatists who plot attacks and stir up tensions between Uighurs who call the region home and the ethnic Han Chinese majority.
Uighurs and other Muslims held in the camps are forbidden from using Islamic greetings, must learn Mandarin Chinese and sing propaganda songs, according to a report by Human Rights Watch based on interviews with five former camp detainees.
People in Xinjiang with relatives living abroad in one of 26 ""sensitive countries"", including Kazakhstan, Turkey and Indonesia, have been targeted by the authorities and are often held for several months, without any formal procedure, the group said.
Punishments for refusing to follow instructions in the camp could mean being denied food, being forced to stand for 24 hours or even solitary confinement, it said.
China foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang declined to give a detailed response to the report and said that Human Rights Watch was a group ""full of prejudice"" against China that distorts facts. 
Measures in Xinjiang aim to ""promote stability, development, unity and livelihoods"", while also cracking down on ""ethnic separatism and violent terrorist criminal activities"", he told a regular briefing.
Security conditions in Xinjiang outside the camps had also intensified markedly and now bear ""a striking resemblance to those inside"", Hong Kong-based Human Rights Watch researcher Maya Wang said, based on interviews with 58 former Xinjiang residents now living abroad.
Wang and her team only spoke with people who had left Xinjiang due to a lack of access to the region and to avoid endangering those still living there.
New security measures described by interviewees include proliferating checkpoints that make use of facial recognition technology and sophisticated police monitoring systems, such as each house having a QR code that, when scanned, shows the authorities who the approved occupants are.

Monitoring of Islamic religious practices, such as asking people how often they pray and the closure of mosques, as well as regular visits by party officials to rural parts of Xinjiang, mean that practicing Islam ""has effectively been outlawed,"" Wang said.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden headed for a hung parliament after an election on Sunday that saw support for the nationalist Sweden Democrats surge, as one of Europe's most liberal nations turned right amid fears over immigration.
Far-right parties have made spectacular gains throughout Europe in recent years as anxieties grow over national identity and the effects of globalization and immigration following armed conflict in the Middle East and North Africa. 
In Sweden, an influx of 163,000 asylum seekers in 2015 - the most in Europe in relation to the country's population of 10 million - has polarized voters and fractured the long-standing political consensus.
With almost all districts having reported, the ruling center-left Social Democrats and Greens and their Left Party parliamentary allies had 40.6 percent of the vote, while the opposition center-right Alliance was at 40.3 percent.
That gave the center-left 144 seats in the 349-seat parliament against 142 for the Alliance, suggesting weeks of uncertainty before a workable government can be formed.
The Sweden Democrats, a party with roots in the white supremacist fringe, won 17.6 percent and 63 seats, up from 12.9 percent and 49 seats in the last election four years ago, the biggest gain by any party in Sweden's parliament, the Riksdag.
The results were largely in line with the conventional opinion polls tracked by Reuters in the run-up to the election but well below some online surveys that had predicted the Sweden Democrats could become the largest party.
While the results also fell short of leader Jimmie Akesson's predictions of 20 percent of the vote or more, he told a party rally it was nevertheless the winner of the election.
""We will gain huge influence over what happens in Sweden during the coming weeks, months and years,"" Akesson told party colleagues.
Akesson hopes his party, which wants Sweden to leave the European Union and freeze immigration, can play a decisive role in negotiations over forming a government.
He called on Ulf Kristersson, the center-right Alliance's candidate for the premiership, to choose between seeking support from the Sweden Democrats for an Alliance government or to accept another four years of Social Democrat Prime Minister Stefan Lofven.
Kristersson called on Lofven to resign, but rebuffed Akesson.
""We have been completely clear during the whole election. The Alliance will not govern or discuss how to form a government with the Sweden Democrats,"" he said.
The Sweden Democrats, shunned by all the other parties since entering parliament in 2010, have promised to sink any Cabinet that refuses to give them a say in policy, particularly on immigration.
Lofven said he would not resign and called for cross-party cooperation to resolve the political impasse.
""There is no side with a majority. Then it is only natural to work across the political divide to make it possible to govern Sweden,"" Lofven said.
GROWING CHORUS OF EUROSCEPTICISM
The election will add to concerns in Brussels as the European Union enters campaign mode ahead of the European Parliament election in May, which could give more voice to eurosceptic groups and thwart efforts at closer EU integration. 
The record levels of those seeking asylum in 2015 magnified worries about a welfare system in Sweden that many voters already believe is in crisis, even though refugee numbers have fallen sharply since then.
Lengthening queues for critical operations, shortages of doctors and teachers and the failures of police to deal with inner-city gang violence have shaken faith in the ""Swedish model"", built on a promise of comprehensive welfare and social inclusion.
Akesson had labeled the vote a choice between immigration and welfare in a campaign that was unusually antagonistic.
Voting in central Stockholm, student Katze Collmar, 32, said the campaign had been ""really unpleasant"".
""It feels like Sweden could take a step in this election that we won't be able to recover from very easily.""
Lofven could hold on to power unless the Alliance accepts some kind of support from the Sweden Democrats, at a likely cost of the populists having more say over immigration policy.

But he would need to overcome decades of acrimony between the two blocs and get support from parties on the center-right, something they have ruled out.

Partii Naleraq said on Sunday it was quitting the coalition over a plan for Denmark to part-fund the construction of three airports in Greenland. 
That would imply direct involvement by Denmark in Greenland politics and ""we do not want to be part of that"", the party said in a letter, local broadcaster KNR reported.
Kielsen's coalition's was formed in May, and Partii Naleraq's departure leaves it with 12 of 31 seats in parliament.
Greenland is a self-ruling part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and while its government decides on most domestic matters, foreign and security policy is handled by Copenhagen.
The Danish government has been concerned that Chinese involvement in the project, as suggested by Greenland, could upset its close ally, the United States.

Gearing up for a general election less than nine months away and provincial polls expected in some states later this year, opposition parties banded together to organize their first protest action in a joint campaign to stir discontent with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government.
The protests turned violent in some states. Television images showed protesters breaking car and bus windows in the Patna, the state capital of the northern state of Bihar, and protesters blocked roads with burning tyres there and elsewhere, including in Modi's home state of Gujarat.
Taxes on petrol and diesel, which account for more than a third of retail fuel prices, are one of the biggest sources of income for the government, and one of the most emotive issues for voters. 
Past governments have usually lowered taxes whenever international oil prices shot up, but Modi's administration has made little concession so far.
""The Modi 'govt' is stealing from the people of India with excessive taxes on fuel,"" the main opposition Congress party said on Twitter, posting graphics on many how prices of many commodities have risen under Modi.
""Not just fuel, even day to day essentials are skyrocketing.""
Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accuses its opponents of ""unnecessarily politicizing"" high fuel prices and the weakening of the rupee currency, which it blames on external factors like the economic woes of countries such as Turkey.
Nevertheless, Modi's popularity has come down in the past few months and his party is likely to face a tough challenge in three BJP-ruled states - Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh - expected to vote this year, and at the general election expected early next year.

PARIS (Reuters) - The United Nations' cultural agency wants to use the reconstruction of Iraq's second city Mosul as a way to restore its credibility and show how a fraying multilateral order can be revived, its director general said on Monday.
Officially entitled the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, Paris-based UNESCO is best known for designating and protecting world heritage sites, from the Galapagos Islands to the tombs of Timbuktu.
It was plunged into turmoil almost a year ago after the United States pulled out, striking a blow to multilateralism and raising questions over the funding of an agency founded after World War Two.
While most of its activities are uncontroversial, UNESCO has seen internal political fights between some of its 195 member states in recent years that have paralyzed its work, notably on issues related to the Holy Land. 
Those culminated in the United States and Israel announcing their withdrawal from the organization, accusing it of anti-Israel bias, just days ahead of the new Director General Audrey Azoulay's appointment in October 2017. 
Almost a year later, Azoulay has sought to refocus the agency on its fundamentals, with Mosul's reconstruction at the center of that effort.
""At a time when multilateralism is sometimes being questioned, the objective and magnitude of this initiative shows exactly why an organization like UNESCO is important,"" Azoulay told Reuters ahead of a conference in Paris on Mosul. 
Partnering with the Iraqi government, UNESCO wants to position itself as the go-to coordinator to rebuild some of the city's landmarks that were turned to rubble by urban warfare between Islamic State militants and the U.S.-backed coalition.
Mosul needs at least $2 billion of reconstruction aid, according to government estimates. Azoulay said she wanted to restore the city's heartbeat, diversity and history, while using UNESCO's educational programs to combat extremism. 
The agency is spearheading the restoration of the city's market, the central library at its university, two churches and a Yazidi temple. 
Its biggest project, funded with $50 million from the United Arab Emirates, is restoring the Grand al-Nuri Mosque, famous for its eight-century-old leaning minaret, which was blown up by Islamic State militants.
The political tension in Baghdad following elections, the unrest in the southern port city of Basra over the last week, and ongoing security threats from Islamic State inevitably raise questions as to how much can actually be achieved.
""We're fully aware of Mosul's specificities and the difficulties on the ground ... but it's exactly because the situation is still fragile that we need to act,"" Azoulay said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's center-right government united behind new Prime Minister Scott Morrison to fend off a de facto vote of no confidence on Monday but his coalition still appeared likely to be heavily punished by voters at an election due by May.
Morrison's Liberal Party, the senior partner in a Liberal-National coalition, fractured in August when a backbench revolt forced then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull from office in a party-room vote, ushering in Australia's sixth leader in 10 years.
His first session of parliament as leader was hostile but Morrison's government united to defeat a series of motions by the opposition Labor party to debate Turnbull's ousting that would have amounted to a confidence vote.
The coalition lost its a majority of only one seat in parliament with Turnbull's resignation in August, leaving it precariously placed to push ahead with its agenda and hold off calls for an early election.
""Given the public mood and the circumstances behind Turnbull's departure, there was the very real prospect that some backbenchers would have moved against the government in order to bring about an election,"" said Haydon Manning, a Flinders University political science professor.
The impact of the political infighting has been laid bare in recent days despite Monday's fragile show of unity.
Australia's prominent Newspoll in The Australian newspaper on Monday showed the coalition would lose up to 30 seats if an election was held now. 
The poll of 1,653 voters showed Labor ahead by 56 to 44 on a two-party-preferred basis in which votes for minor parties are distributed under preference deals. 
It was the 40th straight losing poll for the coalition and a sharp deterioration from the 51-49 result in the last days of Turnbull's leadership.
The government will soon face a by-election for Turnbull's harbourside Sydney electorate and the Newspoll indicated the once-safe Liberal seat could be in jeopardy. A defeat would leave Morrison beholden to a group of independent lawmakers.
The Liberals already had a stark warning in a New South Wales state by-election where official figures on Sunday showed a massive 29 percent swing against them. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian blamed the chaos in Canberra for turning people against the party.
Morrison has used his first few weeks in office to present a down-to-earth image with a message of a ""fair go for those who have a go"" but could struggle to keep the government unified.
Australia's upper house Senate, where the government also doesn't have a majority, passed a bill on Monday that would ban the export of live sheep following a series of animal cruelty cases.
Morrison, who relies on the support of rural voters, opposes the ban but several of his backbenchers have vowed to support the legislation.

He also faces growing calls to address allegations of bullying within his party after allegations from three female backbenchers that they were unduly pressured by supporters of Peter Dutton, whose challenge brought on the leadership vote.

Those detained were among 89 people whose detention was ordered in an investigation by Istanbul prosecutors, it said.
Authorities have carried out such sweeps against suspected supporters of the cleric Fethullah Gulen on a regular basis since the failed coup of July 2016, in which 250 people were killed. Gulen denies involvement.
Turkey has detained 160,000 people and dismissed nearly the same number of civil servants since the putsch attempt, the U.N. human rights office said in March. Of that number, more than 50,000 have been formally charged and kept in jail during their trials.
Turkey's Western allies have criticised the crackdown, which took place under the state of emergency declared shortly after the coup attempt and which remained in effect for two years until July 2018.
Erdogan's critics accuse him of using the failed putsch as a pretext to quash dissent. Turkey says the measures are necessary to combat threats to national security.

Singapore is among at least six countries investigating claims that about $4.5 billion was siphoned off from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a fund founded by former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.
In 2016, Singapore authorities said they had seized S$240 million ($174 million) in cash and properties as a result of investigations into 1MDB-related fund flows through Singapore.
In May, Singapore and Malaysia agreed to cooperate on returning the funds to the Malaysian government, and the court order cleared the way for the first repatriation of funds from Singapore.
Tan, Rajah and Cheah, a Singapore-based law firm, said in a statement that the monies were recovered in various currencies from 1MDB and its former subsidiary, SRC International. 
The funds will be transferred to a special 1MDB recovery account in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital.
""Efforts to recover other unlawfully misappropriated assets are ongoing,"" the firm said.

Singapore has taken action against several banks and bank officials for violating money-laundering controls over transactions related to 1MDB, including the closure of units of BSI Bank and Falcon Bank.

BENI, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - When Esperance Nzavaki heard she was cured of Ebola after three weeks of cutting-edge care at a medical center in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, she raised her arms to the sky with joy and praised the Lord. 
Her recovery is testament to the effectiveness of a new treatment, which isolates patients in futuristic cube-shaped mobile units with transparent walls and gloved access, so health workers no longer need to don cumbersome protective gear.
""I started to feel sick, with a fever and pain all over my body. I thought it was typhoid. I took medicine but it didn't work,"" Nzavaki told Reuters in Beni, a city of several hundred thousand, where officials are racing to contain the virus. 
""Then an ambulance came and brought me to hospital for Ebola treatment. Now I praise God I'm healed.""
The fight against Ebola has advanced more in recent years than in any since it was discovered near Congo's eponymous river in 1976. When the worst outbreak killed 11,300 people in West Africa in 2013-2016, there was no vaccine and treatment amounted to little more than keeping patients comfortable and hydrated.
Now there's an experimental vaccine manufactured by Merck which this year helped quash this strain of the virus on the other side of the country in under three months, while three experimental treatments have been rolled out for the first time.
Yet even the smartest science can do little about the marauding rebel groups and widespread fear and mistrust that could yet scupper efforts to contain Congo's tenth outbreak of the deadly hemorrhagic fever. It is so far believed to have killed 90 people since July and infected another 40.
The stakes are high, not just for health reasons: Ebola could complicate the holding of a Dec. 23 election to replace President Joseph Kabila that is already two years late, and would be Congo's first democratic change of power.
REBELLION, FEAR, MISTRUST
The affected North Kivu and Ituri provinces have been a tinder box of armed rebellion and ethnic killing since two bloody civil wars in the late 1990s. Some areas near the epicenter require armed escorts to reach because of insecurity. Two South African peacekeepers there were wounded in a rebel ambush last week.
And last week, authorities confirmed the first death from Ebola in the major trading hub of Butembo, a city of almost a million near the border with Uganda, dampening hopes that the virus was being brought under control.
Insecurity aside, the biggest challenges the government faces could be panic and downright denial, as they were during the catastrophic West Africa outbreak. 
""Ebola does not exist in Beni,"" resident Tresor Malala said, shaking his head. ""For a long time, people got sick with fever, diarrhea, vomiting and they healed. Now someone gets a fever, they get sent to the Ebola treatment center and then they die.""
Taxi driver Mosaste Kala was equally skeptical: ""The only people dying are the ones going to the ... treatment center.""
Tackling these perceptions will be crucial if authorities are to halt the epidemic. 
At a news conference on Saturday, Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga admitted that ""community resistance is the first challenge to the response to the epidemic"".
In the district of Ndindi, in Beni, Ebola is spreading due to the community's reluctance to cooperate with health workers, the ministry says. Some locals have hidden sick relatives or refused to be vaccinated.
The problem, says school teacher Alain Mulonda, many of whose pupils were being kept at home by anxious parents, is that locals have little understanding of Ebola. 

""If the population of Beni continues to show this distrust,"" he said, ""this disease will consume the whole town.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - The death toll from a powerful earthquake in northern Japan last week rose to 44, with 660 injured, the government said on Monday, as electricity supply remained short and top automaker Toyota suspended work at most of its assembly plants.
The pre-dawn, 6.7-magnitude quake on Thursday temporarily paralyzed the island of Hokkaido, cutting off access by air and train and knocking out power to an island the size of Austria.
About 2,500 people remain in evacuation centers, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, after landslides buried houses and rain at the weekend loosened soil in a further threat to unstable houses.
Yoshihide Suga, the top government spokesman, said a team of about 40,000 Self-Defense Force troops, police, firefighters and others were working on clearing debris and other clean-up operations. There were no more missing residents, he said.
Power supply has been restored to nearly all customers in Hokkaido but trade minister Hiroshige Seko called on the island's businesses and 5.3 million residents to use about 20 percent less energy to prevent further blackouts. 
""It's very important now for all residents, businesses, the government, and electricity suppliers to work together towards this goal of 20 percent energy-saving,"" Seko told a news conference late on Sunday. 
The government has no plans for rolling blackouts on Monday and Tuesday despite the continued closure of a fossil fuel-fired power plant that supplies about half the island's power, he said.
With electricity restored, Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said on Monday its parts factory in Tomakomai, Hokkaido, which builds transmissions and other components, was preparing to resume production during the night shift.

However, the fallout has already spread beyond the island, with Toyota suspending production at 16 of its 18 domestic car assembly plants on Monday to assess its parts inventory. The automaker said it would gradually restore production from Tuesday, resuming work fully by Thursday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, eyeing an historic extended term, reaffirmed on Monday his resolve to revise the nation's post-war, pacifist constitution and said he hoped his party could submit a proposal to parliament later this year.
Abe, who returned to office in December 2012 pledging to bolster defenses and reboot the economy, is widely expected to defeat his rival, former defense minister Shigeru Ishiba, in a Sept. 20 election for leader of his Liberal Democratic Party.
Victory would give him another three-year term as LDP head and set him on track to become Japan's longest serving premier, given the LDP-led ruling coalition's grip on parliament.
Article 9 of the constitution, if taken literally, bans maintenance of armed forces but it has been interpreted to allow a military for self-defense. 
Abe wants to add a reference to the Self-Defense Forces, as Japan's military is known, to clarify their status.
That would be a largely symbolic change but one long sought by conservatives who see the U.S.-drafted constitution as a humiliating reminder of defeat in World War Two and opposed by critics who worry about expanding the SDF's role overseas.
""Isn’t it the mission of us politicians living today to create an environment in which they (SDF members) can carry out their duties with a sense of pride?"" Abe said in a televised speech to LDP members. 
""Let’s fulfill our mission by clearly writing in the constitution the Self-Defense Forces that protect peace and independence of Japan,"" he said.
Abe told a news conference he hoped the LDP could present its proposal to parliament in an extra session likely to be held later this year.
An attempt to revise the constitution would be politically risky. The public is divided and the LDP's dovish partner, the Komeito, is wary. Amendments require approval of two-thirds of both houses of parliament and a majority in a referendum.
Abe, who met South Korean presidential envoy to North Korea Suh Hoon on Monday, reiterated he wants to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to resolve the matter of Japanese citizens kidnapped by Pyongyang's agents decades ago.
In 2002, North Korea admitted that it kidnapped 13 Japanese in the 1970s and 1980s. Japan believes 17 of its citizens were abducted, five of whom were repatriated. Eight are said by North Korea to have died, while four never entered the country.

Abe also promised in his speech to strengthen Japan's infrastructure over the next three years to withstand the sort of deadly disasters floods, landslides and earthquakes that have buffeted the country recently. He gave no details.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing city authorities have banned one of the largest unofficial Protestant churches in the city and confiscated ""illegal promotional materials"", amid a deepening crackdown on China's ""underground"" churches.
The Zion church had for years operated with relative freedoms, hosting hundreds of worshippers every weekend in an expansive specially renovated hall in north Beijing.
But since April, after they rejected requests from authorities to install closed-circuit television cameras in the building, the church has faced growing pressure from the authorities and has been threatened with eviction.
On Sunday, the Beijing Chaoyang district civil affairs bureau said that by organizing events without registering, the church was breaking rules forbidding mass gatherings and were now ""legally banned"" and its ""illegal promotional material"" had been confiscated, according to images of the notice sent to Reuters late on Sunday and confirmed by churchgoers. 
""I fear that there is no way for us to resolve this issue with the authorities,"" Zion's Pastor Jin Mingri told Reuters.
China's religious affairs and civil affairs bureaux did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
China's constitution guarantees religious freedom, but since President Xi Jinping took office six years ago the government has tightened restrictions on religions seen as a challenge to the authority of the ruling Communist Party.
Churches across China have faced new waves of harassment and pressure to register since a new set of regulations to govern religious affairs in China came into effect in February and heightened punishments for unofficial churches.
In July, more than 30 of Beijing's hundreds of underground Protestant churches took the rare step of releasing a joint statement complaining of ""unceasing interference"" and the ""assault and obstruction"" of regular activities of believers since the new regulations came into effect.
China's Christian believers are split between those who attend unofficial ""house"" or ""underground"" churches and those who attend government-sanctioned places of worship.
Churchgoers were also given a notice from the district religious affairs bureau saying that the ""great masses of believer must respect the rules and regulations and attend events in legally registered places of religious activity"".
Zion's attendees were also given pamphlets of officially sanctioned churches that they might attend instead.
But for many worshippers and pastors, such as Jin, accepting the oversight and ultimate authority of the Communist Party would be a betrayal of their faith.

""On this land, the only one we can trust in is God,"" Jin said.

SAN SALVADOR/TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - A U.S.-hosted meeting with Mexico and Central American countries scheduled for this week in Washington has been called off, officials said on Sunday, as President Donald Trump's policies test relations with the region.
The United States said the conference of the Alliance for Prosperity, a U.S.-led economic and security group, was postponed because of ""scheduling conflicts"" and with agreement by the participating countries. But El Salvador said it was Washington's decision to suspend the meeting and that it did not know the reason.
""We are currently exploring alternate dates,"" said an official for the U.S. State Department who declined to be named. ""We are committed to our partnership with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to address security, prosperity and governance challenges in the region.""
Launched in 2014, the Alliance for Prosperity was a U.S. bid to curb migration from the ""Northern Triangle"" of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras by strengthening economic growth and funding security programs. 
But U.S. and Central American officials have clashed in recent months. Many Central American families were affected by the U.S. government's policy earlier this year of separating migrant children and parents trying to cross the U.S.-Mexican border, and governments in the region have demanded information from the United States as they seek to reunite families.
On Friday, the United States said it recalled its top diplomats in El Salvador, along with the Dominican Republic and Panama, over those countries' decisions to ditch diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favor of China.
The State Department official, responding to a Reuters request for comment on the cancellation of the conference scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, made no mention of any tensions.""Due to scheduling conflicts, the Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, and the governments of Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras decided on September 7 to postpone the conference,"" the official said.
The El Salvadoran government said in a statement late on Saturday that it regretted what it said was a U.S. cancellation of the meeting. ""El Salvador is ready to participate and waiting for this conference to be rescheduled,"" officials said.
José Isaías Barahona, Honduras' deputy foreign minister, said the meeting was canceled because of scheduling conflicts. 
""Surely when schedules line up, El Salvador, along with Honduras and Guatemala, will attend the meetings of the Alliance for Prosperity,"" he said in an interview. 
Marta Larra, a spokeswoman for the Guatemalan Foreign Ministry, said she had been informed the meeting was postponed because the dates did not work well for the Central American countries. 
Citing U.S. officials, the Washington Post reported on Saturday that the meeting was canceled after El Salvador and Guatemala said they would not send envoys. But El Salvador said it had been planning to attend.

1555,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2018 06:20PM ET</span>","British ex-Foreign Minister Johnson attacks government on taxes, rail","LONDON (Reuters) - Former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched a two-pronged attack on Britain's government on Sunday, criticizing suggestions it may increase taxes to fund services and its management of a high-speed rail project.
In his weekly column in the Telegraph newspaper, Johnson, bookmakers' favorite to succeed Prime Minister Theresa May, called on the government to avoid turning on the ""hard-pressed taxpayer"" for money to fund public services, and instead embrace Brexit to spur a ""dynamic economy"".
Johnson has become a thorn in the side of May since he resigned as foreign minister over her Brexit plan, using newspaper columns to pressure her government over everything from social and fiscal policy to Britain's departure from the European Union in what some lawmakers see as a leadership bid. 
Earlier, he was criticized for accusing May of wrapping ""a suicide vest around"" Britain and handing the detonator to the EU with her plans for Brexit - the biggest shift in British foreign and trade policy for almost half a century.
""We do need to spend more on the NHS (National Health Service). We must find the extra 20 billion pounds ($25.84 billion) that the chancellor (finance minister) has rightly promised. We do need to step up our investments in the police and schools and other vital public services,"" he wrote.
""But I am afraid I am not convinced that the answer is immediately to turn to the hard-pressed taxpayer, when Britain is now by no means a low-tax economy compared with several other jurisdictions in Europe.""
Britain should look to the United States, he said, using what he called an unfashionable argument to highlight its high growth rates, record low employment and what he described as a government that ""wants to liberate and energize people"".
Earlier this year, May pledged to increase funding for the NHS by 20 billion pounds ($26.57 billion) over the next five years but said some of the funding would need to come from higher taxes or more borrowing.
Johnson also said that ""someone should pay a price"" for the difficulties with Britain's multi-billion pound rail project High Speed 2, which has been delayed, seen costs rise and put pressure on Transport Minister Chris Grayling.
The figurehead for Britain's campaign to leave the EU, Johnson again urged the government to be confident over Brexit, saying the ""direful predictions"" for the economy before the 2016 referendum had not turned out to be true.

""Now is the time for this Conservative government to show how a post-Brexit Britain will be a happy and dynamic economy that fosters enterprise, that rewards the strivers and the innovators, and where people can hope to take home more of their pay to their families,"" he wrote.

The air strikes targeted the village of Hajin, the last major stronghold of Islamic State in Syria, and resulted in fires, but there was no information about casualties, the Russian military said.
A Pentagon spokesman denied that U.S. planes dropped phosphorus bombs. ""At this time, we have not received any reports of any use of white phosphorous,"" said Commander Sean Robertson. ""None of the military units in the area are even equipped with white phosphorous munitions of any kind.""
Human rights groups have said the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State has used white phosphorous munitions over the course of the Syria conflict. The bombs can create thick white smoke screens and are used as incendiary devices. The rights groups criticize use of the munitions in populated zones because they can kill and maim by burning people to the bone.
The coalition or partner forces likely conducted aerial strikes in July on eastern Syria where remnants of Islamic State are holed up, the coalition has said.
U.S.-Russian tensions have heightened in recent days as the Trump administration considers military options should Syria ignore U.S. warnings against using chemical weapons in an expected assault on Idlib, the last big enclave of rebels opposing Syria's government. 
Russian and Syrian jets resumed strikes in Idlib and Hama on Sunday as Damascus stepped up its assault after a Russian-Iranian-Turkish summit failed to agree on a ceasefire.

In an interview published by French newspaper Ouest France, the former Belgian prime minister said he is ready for the European liberals and La Republique en Marche, the party created by Macron, to build an alternative to populism.
Asked about an alliance, Christophe Castaner, the head of La Republique en Marche, dismissed Verhoftsadt's comments. ""We are not ready for an alliance,"" he told Reuters on Sunday.
As Italian and Hungarian leaders have met and stressed their common vision, pro-European liberal parties intend to fight back ahead of European Parliament elections in May. 
""The fight in 2019 will be a fight between the nationalist populists on one side and a pro-European alternative,"" Verhofstadt told Ouest France.
The liberal leader said each party would campaign together with common proposals but keep their own identities. ""The goal is to create a decisive group in the future parliament, that would be a tool to stop the nationalist tide,"" he said.
The fourth largest group in the European Parliament, with 68 MPs out of 751, is courting the newcomer on the European stage to join its ranks and gain clout after the May elections.
This summer, Castaner toured Europe to seek allies ahead of the elections. He had a meeting with Verhofstadt last Tuesday.

Eight months ahead of the vote, Macron has positioned himself as the main opponent to European nationalists. On Thursday he called on the European Popular Party, the conservative group in Parliament to clarify its position, saying it cannot have Angela Merkel and Hungary's Viktor Orban under the same banner.

1558,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2018 05:14PM ET</span>",Sudan's President Bashir dissolves government,"By Eric Knecht and Khalid Abdelaziz
KHARTOUM (Reuters) - President Omar al Bashir dissolved the Sudanese government on Sunday, a move aimed at fixing a crisis-hit economy battered in recent months by shortages of bread, fuel and hard currency.
The announcement included a cut in the number of ministries to 21 from 31, a presidential statement said late on Sunday, without announcing any new government appointments.
The move came just after Bashir called an emergency meeting of ruling party officials in the presidential palace.
The government has been trying to slash expenditure as it grapples with record high inflation, the hard currency shortage and growing concern over low levels of liquidity at commercial banks.
Long queues outside commercial banks have become a fixture around Khartoum in recent weeks as the liquidity of the local currency has dwindled and ATMs have been emptied of cash. Withdrawal limits in some places have been set as low as 500 Sudanese pounds ($27.85).
The statement said the measures were necessary to solve ""the state of distress and frustration faced by the country during the last period"".
Sudan’s economy has been struggling since the south seceded in 2011, taking with it three-quarters of oil output and depriving Khartoum of a crucial source of foreign currency.
The lifting of 20-year-old U.S. trade sanctions last year was expected to usher in a more prosperous era for a country that had long been isolated.
But economic woes have only deepened as a black market for U.S. dollars has in effect replaced the formal banking system, making it more difficult and expensive to import essential supplies such as wheat.
The dollar has risen to about 47 pounds on the black market in recent months, against an official rate of about 30 pounds. This helped to push annual inflation to around 64 percent in July.
A doubling of the price of bread in January, after the government eliminated subsidies, triggered demonstrations.

Sudan has been without a central bank governor since June, when Hazem Abdelqader died after suffering a heart attack while on a trip to Turkey.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni on Sunday warned against foreign interference in the country's politics days after an opposition call for the United States to suspend military aid over the government's human rights record.
Museveni also accused some unnamed foreign countries of seeking to influence the nation's politics by funneling assistance to the opposition through non-governmental organizations.
""It is important that external players refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of other countries,"" Museveni told a press conference on Sunday. 
""If there's any problem in Uganda, I surely will handle it better than the outsider."" 
Last week the U.S. lawyer for opposition lawmaker Robert Kyagulanyi, a musician known by his stage name Bobi Wine, called on the United States to stop funding Uganda's military as a punitive measure against what Kyagulanyi said was torture by authorities in his country.
Kyagulanyi and fellow parliamentarian Francis Zaake say they were tortured by security forces while in detention in August. The case led to protests against Museveni.
Kyagulanyi, who has emerged as a formidable threat to the president, was charged with treason over his alleged role in the stoning of Museveni's convoy during campaigning for a parliamentary seat. 
The government in Kampala denies torturing Kyagulanyi.
In power since 1986, Museveni has been widely accused by opposition critics and rights campaigners of using security forces to suppress opposition to his rule. 
""NGOs (non-governmental organizations) funded by foreign governments actually give money to opposition players, give advice, lie on their behalf,"" Museveni said.
Museveni also said his government had taken a decision to deploy thousands of auxiliary forces in the capital Kampala to boost security after a rash of assassinations of prominent people, including two police officers, a lawmaker and a public prosecutor. 
In July, the constitution was amended to remove the presidential age limit of 75 years, meaning Museveni can run again for president in 2021 -- the year the country hopes to begin oil production.

In June, Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, said the facility at the Natanz nuclear plant would be completed within a month.
Salehi's statement in June came days after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said he had ordered preparations to increase the country's uranium enrichment capacity if the nuclear agreement with world powers collapsed.
On Sunday, the official news agency IRNA quoted Salehi as saying: ""(Ayatollah Khamenei) had ordered us to set up and complete a very advanced hall for the construction of modern centrifuges, and this hall has now been fully equipped and set up."" 
Salehi said Iran's announced plans to build nuclear reactors for ships, while staying within the limits set by its atomic deal with major powers, was ""advancing well but would take 10 to 15 years to complete"", IRNA said.
""A third step (in reaction to the U.S. withdrawal) might be to suspend some of the limitations within the nuclear agreement, for example on the volume and level of enrichment,"" Salehi said, according to IRNA.
""And the final scenario can be a complete exit from the nuclear accord, which I hope will never happen, with the help of (remaining signatories), because everyone would suffer,"" Salehi added.
Iranian officials have said they would decide whether to quit the 2015 nuclear deal after studying a planned European package of economic measures that could help offset U.S. sanctions.

A Cairo court in July found Mona el-Mazboh guilty of deliberately spreading false rumors that would harm society, attacking religion, and public indecency.
El-Mazboh was arrested at Cairo airport in June at the end of her stay in Egypt after a 10-minute video in which she was complaining of sexual harassment and conditions in Egypt using explicit language went viral on social media.
The court reduced her sentence to one year and suspended it, MENA said.
El-Mazboh is expected to be released on Monday and will deported on Wednesday, her lawyer Hassan Berzi said. 
In the video, 24-year-old Mazboh complained of being sexually harassed by taxi drivers and young men in the street, as well as poor restaurant service during the holy month of Ramadan and an incident in which money was stolen from her during a previous stay.
Egyptian rights activists say they face the worst crackdown in their history under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, accusing him of erasing freedoms won in the 2011 Arab Spring uprising that ended Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule.
Supporters say such measures are needed to stabilize Egypt after years of turmoil that drove away foreign investors and amid an Islamist insurgency concentrated in the Sinai Peninsula.

MORONI (Reuters) - Prosecutors in Comoros have issued an international arrest warrant for former vice president Jaffar Ahmed Said Hassani on charges of plotting against the state, according to a document seen by Reuters.
Jaffar openly opposed a referendum to extend presidential term limits held in June and the suspension of the constitutional court by President Azali Assoumani. 
He left the Indian Ocean state on Monday on a flight to Tanzania.
The warrant, issued by the government on Friday, accused Jaffar of ""plotting against the authority of the state"". Another letter issued by the Foreign Ministry and seen by Reuters informs embassies of the revocation of his diplomatic passports.
Government officials were not immediately available to give details.
Since last month, a number of people have been arrested and charged with plotting to destabilize Comoros. 
On Aug. 2, Assoumani said he had won the referendum to extend presidential term limits and end a system oZf rotating power among the archipelago's three main islands by an overwhelming majority.
The yes vote allows him to run for two more five year-terms starting with an early election next year, rather than being required to step down when his present term ends in 2021.
Opposition parties and civil society organizations grouped under the Peace in the Comoros umbrella group disputed the figures, saying many voters had boycotted the poll.

Assoumani, a former military officer, joins a string of African leaders in countries such as Rwanda, Uganda and Cameroon who have extended presidential term limits or amended the constitution in order to remain in power.

Bolsonaro, 63, remains in intensive care as the perforations of his intestines keep doctors watching for any internal infections. In a written statement, the Einstein Hospital in Sao Paulo said he was spending more time out of bed, but still receiving food intravenously. 
Thursday's knife attack against Bolsonaro further complicated Brazil's most unpredictable election in three decades. Corruption investigations have jailed scores of powerful businessmen and politicians in recent years, infuriating voters. 
Bolsonaro has for years angered many Brazilians with extreme statements on race, gender and sexual preference, but is also seen by his many supporters as an outsider who could clean up a broken system. 
Police have a suspect in custody and say only that they are continuing the investigation and that no clear motive was yet known, though the assailant told police he stabbed Bolsonaro on Thursday on ""orders from God."" 

Surveys consistently give Bolsonaro, a member of the Social Liberal Party, around 22 percent in simulated first-round votes. However, those polls find he would badly lose to most rivals in the likely event of a runoff, which takes place if no candidate wins a majority in the first ballot.

PYONGYANG (Reuters) - With no long-range missiles on display, North Korea staged a military parade on Sunday focused on conventional arms, peace and economic development as it marked the 70th anniversary of the country's founding.
The reduced display compared to past years earned a thank you note from U.S. President Donald Trump, who hailed it as a ""big and very positive statement from North Korea.""
Trump on Twitter quoted a Fox News description of the event without long-range nuclear missiles as a sign of North Korea's ""commitment to denuclearize.""
""Thank you To Chairman Kim. We will both prove everyone wrong! There is nothing like good dialogue from two people that like each other! Much better than before I took office,"" Trump tweeted.
In Pyongyang, line upon line of goose-stepping soldiers and columns of tanks shook the ground before giving way to chanting crowds waving flags and flowers as they passed a review stand where North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sat with a special envoy from China, as well as other visiting foreigners.
Kim told the envoy, Chinese parliament chief Li Zhanshu, that North Korea was focusing on economic development and hopes to learn from China's experience in this regard, Chinese state television reported.
""North Korea upholds the consensus of the Singapore meeting between the leaders of North Korea and the United States and has taken steps for it and hopes the United States takes corresponding steps, to jointly promote the political resolution process for the peninsula issue,"" the report paraphrased Kim as saying.
The parade highlight themes of military accomplishment, national development, and international engagement at a time when doubts are arising over Kim's commitment to abandoning nuclear weapons.
Unlike in previous years, there were no inter-continental missiles on display. And there were no nuclear tests to mark the holiday, as has happened in each of the last two years. 
North Korea routinely uses major holidays to showcase its military capabilities and the latest developments in missile technology.
But that has lessened this year, underlining Kim's stated aim for denuclearizing the Korean peninsula and his recent meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and summits with Trump in Singapore and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing and Dalian.
The theme for the celebrations this year was economic development and unifying the Korean peninsula, divided since World War Two. 
A huge float was decorated with a modern train, solar panels, wind power plants and dams, under a slogan of ""All our might to build economy!"", as North Korean men in construction work wear marched.
Kim Yong Nam, North Korea's titular head of state, gave a speech at the parade in which he said the country had achieved status as a military power, and would now pursue efforts to strengthen its economy.
Floats on unification also passed by a throng of North Koreans waving unified Korea flags.
""All Koreans should join forces to accomplish unification in our generation. Unification is the only way Koreans can survive,"" said an editorial in North Korea's party newspaper Rodong Sinmun. 
Kim Jong Un and his South Korean counterpart Moon will meet in Pyongyang on Sept. 18-20 for the third time this year and discuss ""practical measures"" toward denuclearization, officials in Seoul have said.
KIM'S LETTER
Despite stalled progress on talks with Washington, the North Korean leader wants to denuclearize the peninsula within Trump's first term, according to South Korean officials.
Trump said on Friday that Kim has sent a letter to him, which he believes will be positive.
Melissa Hanham, a senior research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, said the military component of the parade appeared to be scaled down this year.
""I am very curious to hear what is in the letter to Trump, because this parade could have been more provocative,"" Hanham said, adding satellite evidence showed North Korea continued missile-related activities such as testing solid fuel motors.
Kim was seen laughing and holding hands up with China's Li as he oversaw the festivities at Pyongyang's main Kim Il Sung square on a clear autumn day. Kim waved to the crowd before leaving but did not make any public remarks.
North Korea has invited a large group of foreign journalists to cover a military parade and other events to mark the 70th anniversary of its founding. 
That includes iconic mass games that Pyongyang is organizing for the first time in five years, a huge, nationalist pageant performed by up to 100,000 people in one of the world's largest stadiums.
Both the Mass Games and the military parade have been criticized by human rights advocates and North Korean defectors for the pressure placed on performers and for painting a distorted picture of the country through stage-managed displays.
But thousands of jovial North Koreans clapped in unison and rallied support for their leader Kim. 

A concert on Saturday night attended by Kim Yong Nam and foreign delegations featured little in the way of martial messaging or images, with only a few shadowy American bombers shown briefly in footage of the 1950-1953 Korean War.

The Trump administration held secret meetings with rebellious military officers over the last year to discuss their plans to overthrow President Nicolas Maduro, the New York Times reported https://nyti.ms/2MceKbj on Saturday.
The article cited unnamed American officials and a former Venezuelan military commander who participated in the talks.
""We denounce the intervention plans and support for military conspirators by the government of the United States against Venezuela,"" Jorge Arreaza wrote on Twitter on Saturday. ""Even in U.S. media, the crass evidence is coming to light.""
Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for the National Security Council, did not deny the report, but said in a statement that the ""U.S. policy preference for a peaceful, orderly return to democracy in Venezuela remains unchanged.""
U.S. President Donald Trump last year said the United States was considering all options with respect to Venezuela, including the ""military option."" 
The comments brought widespread condemnation from countries around the region as well as from Maduro's adversaries in Venezuela.
The country's economy has collapsed under Maduro, with annual inflation running at 200,000 percent, and staple foods and basic medicine increasingly difficult to obtain. 
Citizens are increasingly seeking refuge in nearby countries including Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.

Maduro says the country is the victim of an ""economic war"" led by opposition politicians with the help of the Trump administration, which has slapped several rounds of sanctions on his government.

1566,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Hans-Georg Maassen: the spy who went out into the heat,"By Paul Carrel
BERLIN (Reuters) - Spies usually operate in the shadows. Hans-Georg Maassen, chief of Germany's domestic spy agency, has done just the opposite and taken center-stage in a heated debate about the far-right that is shaking Chancellor Angela Merkel's government to its core.
In comments to Friday's edition of mass-selling daily Bild, Maassen said he was skeptical about reports that migrants had been hounded in the city of Chemnitz after the fatal stabbing of a German man there, for which two asylum seekers were arrested.
The violence in the eastern city has shaken Germany deeply. But Maassen said his BfV domestic intelligence agency had ""no reliable information about such hunts taking place"", and that a video circulating showing that happening could have been faked. 
Those comments put him at odds with Merkel, who said images from Chemnitz ""very clearly"" showed hate. She has also accused the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party of using violent protests over the stabbing to stir up ethnic tension.
The upshot is that senior politicians are calling for 55-year-old Maassen to go. He will likely have to explain himself to a parliamentary committee this week. His own stance toward the far-right is also being questioned.
""Will the AfD soon have a new hero?"" the Bild am Sonntag newspaper asked in a headline next to a picture of Maassen, whose face was plastered across German weekend newspapers and television bulletins.
Questions have been raised before about how aggressively Maassen has taken on the far-right, including the AfD, which he has resisted putting under surveillance.
A former leader of the AfD's youth wing, Franziska Schreiber, wrote in her book published this year - ""Inside AFD: The report of a drop-out"" - that Maassen had advised ex-AfD leader Frauke Petry on how the party could avoid being put under surveillance by his office. He has denied giving such counsel.
POLITICAL FALLOUT
A trained lawyer who forged his career in the Interior Ministry, Maassen has generally stayed out of the spotlight during his six years in charge of the BfV, though he has clashed with other more circumspect government officials for calling out Russia as the likely culprit behind cyber attacks on Germany.
In a 2016 interview with Reuters, Maassen said far-right extremists in Germany were increasingly ready to commit violent acts - a risk he has since flagged again.
On Friday, Maassen's BfV intelligence agency said it would make further checks on information available about the Chemnitz protests as ""there are always fake news and attempts at disinformation"" on social media. 
""Checks, in particular with regard to possible 'hounding' of migrants by right-wing extremists, will continue,"" it added.
Maassen's Chemnitz comments have aggravated tensions about whether politicians and the authorities are being too complacent in the face of rising xenophobia in Germany, where many thought the lessons of its Nazi history had long been learned.
The remarks have also split Berlin's political class and re-opened fissures over immigration in Merkel's 'grand coalition', only two months after she closed a painful row with her Bavarian sister party on the same issue.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), has backed Maassen. Alexander Gauland, co-leader of the anti-immigrant AfD, told the Bild am Sonntag: ""All accusations against him are politically motivated.""

But Malu Dreyer, a senior figure in the Social Democrats, junior partner in Merkel's coalition, said he had created uncertainty and ""destroyed"" trust in the state. ""So I do not think he is still the right man for this position,"" she added.

The work will be undertaken by state-controlled Fincantieri, in cooperation with Autostrade per l'Italia, Giovanni Toti, the governor of the Liguria region, which is centered on Genoa, told a business conference in northern Italy.
Last month's collapse of the bridge operated by motorway group Autostrade, which is controlled by infrastructure company Atlantia, killed 43 people.
""The reconstruction will cost between 150 and 200 million euros, while 10-12 million will be necessary for the demolition of the old one and more funds should be granted to families and shopkeepers affected by the disaster,"" said Toti.
The regional governor has been appointed as the coordinator for the bridge disaster relief, giving him a powerful voice in the reconstruction initiative.
Italy's ruling coalition, which comprises the far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, has accused Autostrade of serious oversights in its maintenance of the bridge and said it wants to revoke its motorway concessions. 
Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli, who is a member of 5-Star, has said Autostrade must pay for the rebuilding work, but should not be involved in any other way.
But Toti appeared to reject that line. ""Fincantieri will have the leadership of the reconstruction, together with a group of companies that will also include Autostrade,"" he said.
Toti said he had asked the government to issue a decree to waive European Union tender rules for public works to fast-track the reconstruction.
A consortium including Fincantieri and Autostrade would be the quickest way to rebuild the viaduct, a key piece of infrastructure for both Genoa and the country, he said.
""The port of Genoa generates 1.5 percent of Italy's gross domestic product ... we have to focus to give the bridge back to Genoa and its citizens,"" said Toti, who is a member of the conservative, opposition group Forza Italia! (Go Italy!).
Toninelli took to Twitter to criticize Toti's drive to put together a consortium, saying he was using the disaster to win political consensus.

But Toti dismissed the attack: ""A ministry that was not able to supervise infrastructure as it should have cannot block local authorities who are working efficiently on behalf of their citizens,"" he said.

""Despite the negative impact on own resources, ecology and local population, we have opened our border to give shelter to a huge number of Rohingya Muslims on humanitarian grounds,"" Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said while inaugurating the regional hub of the IDB in the Bangladesh capital, Dhaka.
""I urge the international community to take specific steps to build up pressure on Myanmar to implement the deal,"" Hasina added, without specifying which measures she had in mind.
More than 700,000 Rohingya refugees crossed from the west of mostly Buddhist Myanmar into Bangladesh from August last year when Rohingya insurgent attacks on the Myanmar security forces triggered a sweeping military response.
""The IDB cannot remain silent, when Myanmar's Rohingya citizens are victims of ethnic cleansing,"" Hasina added.
There was no immediate comment from the IDB.
The two countries reached a deal in November to begin repatriation within two months, but it has not started, with stateless Rohingya, who face restrictions on their movements in Myanmar, still crossing the border.
Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay declined to comment on Sunday, citing a new communications policy under which he said he would only answer the media's questions during fortnightly press conferences in the capital Naypyitaw.
Myanmar has said it is ready to accept back the refugees and has built two reception centers and a transit camp to house them initially on their return.
Right groups say conditions in Myanmar's northern Rakhine state are not ready yet for the repatriation. 
Myanmar's government said on Friday it ""resolutely rejects"" a ruling from the International Criminal Court (ICC) that said the body has jurisdiction over alleged deportations of Rohingya Muslims to Bangladesh as a possible crime against humanity.

Myanmar has denied allegations of atrocities made against its security forces by refugees, saying its military carried out justifiable actions against militants.

Hanoi is hosting the World Economic Forum on ASEAN (The Association of South East Asian Nations) on Sept. 11-13, an event touted as the biggest diplomatic gathering in the Southeast Asian country this year.
Debbie Stothard was unable to enter Vietnam on Sunday as she arrived at Noi Bai International Airport in Hanoi to attend the event, World Economic Forum spokeswoman Fon Mathuros told Reuters in an emailed statement.
Despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness to social change, Vietnam's ruling Communist Party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism. 
The country has jailed several human rights activists in recent years, accusing them of attempting to overthrow the state.
""We regret the government's decision to deny her entry,"" Mathuros said.
""Whatever inconvenience I am being subjected to is nothing compared to the attacks on Vietnam human rights defenders and the media,"" Stothard said in a tweet.
""I hoped that hosting the prestigious WEF would help them realize that pluralism, human rights and freedom are necessary to economic development,"" she said in the tweet.
Vietnam's Foreign Ministry did not immediately comment on the issue.
""Her invitation to the meeting stands and we will continue to facilitate her participation in the meeting,"" Mathuros said.

The World Economic Forum on ASEAN is expected to attract several regional leaders and focus on the innovation needed to propel the region through the next phase of its growth.

His statement came just before Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards said it fired seven missiles in an attack on Iraq-based Iranian Kurdish dissidents that killed at least 11 people on Saturday.
""Increase your power as much as you can, because your power scares off the enemy and forces it to retreat,"" Khamenei's official website quoted him as saying at a graduation ceremony for cadets of Iran's regular armed forces. 
U.S. President Donald Trump in May withdrew from Iran’s nuclear agreement with world powers -- a deal aimed at stalling Tehran’s nuclear capabilities in return for lifting some sanctions -- and ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions that had been suspended under the deal. 
""Iran and the Iranian nation have resisted America and proven that, if a nation is not afraid of threats by bullies and relies on its own capabilities, it can force the superpowers to retreat and defeat them,"" Khamenei said during a visit to Iran's Caspian port city of Nowshahr.
State television also showed Khamenei praising Iranian naval forces in the Gulf of Aden, off the coast of Yemen, while speaking to their commander via videolink.
Shi'ite power Iran rejects accusations from Saudi Arabia that it is giving financial and military support to Yemen's Houthis, who are fighting a government backed by a Saudi-led military coalition of Sunni Arab countries.
Meanwhile, a senior military official said Iran had capability to export the know-how to produce solid rocket fuel, the state news agency IRNA reported. Solid fuel rockets can be fired on short notice.
""In the scientific field, today we have reached a stage where we can export the technology to produce solid rocket fuel,"" said Brigadier General Majid Bokaei, director-general of Iran's main defense university, quoted by IRNA.
Iran said earlier this month it planned to boost its ballistic and cruise missile capacity and acquire modern fighter planes and submarines to boost its defense capabilities.

On Saturday Iran dismissed a French call for negotiations on Tehran’s future nuclear plans, its ballistic missile arsenal and its role in wars in Syria and Yemen, following the U.S. pullout from Iran's 2015 nuclear agreement.

1573,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2018 09:04AM ET</span>",U.N. rights boss Bachelet urges Egypt to overturn mass death sentences,"GENEVA (Reuters) - United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet on Sunday urged Egypt's appeals court to overturn mass death sentences handed down by a lower court after what she said was an ""unfair trial"".
The former Chilean President, who took office as U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights last week, criticized a law giving immunity from future prosecution to senior military officers.
An Egyptian court on Saturday delivered death sentences to 75 people, including prominent Islamist leaders Essam al-Erian and Mohamed Beltagi, over a 2013 sit-in that ended with security forces killing hundreds of protesters. 
If carried out, the sentences ""would represent a gross and irreversible miscarriage of justice"", Bachelet said in a statement.
Defendants were denied the right to individual lawyers and to present evidence, while ""the prosecution did not provide sufficient evidence to prove individual guilt"", she said.
""I hope that the Egyptian Court of Appeal will review this verdict and ensure that international standards of justice are respected by setting it aside,"" Bachelet said.
The sentencing, which included jail terms for more than 600 others, concluded a mass trial of people accused of murder and inciting violence during the pro-Muslim Brotherhood protest at Rabaa Adawiya square in Cairo. 
The decision can be appealed within 60 days.
Since 2013, Egyptian courts have sentenced hundreds to death, but most sentences were appealed and very few carried out.
Amnesty International has condemned Saturday's decision, calling the trial ""disgraceful"".
Bachelet decried the ""lethal military crackdown"" saying it had led to the killing of ""up to 900 mostly unarmed protesters by members of the Egyptian security forces"". The Government later claimed that many protesters had been armed and that a number of police were killed, she added.
The Rabaa square demonstration in 2013 had followed weeks of protests against the ousting of Islamist President Mohamed Mursi by the Sisi-led military.
""Despite the huge death toll, no State security personnel have ever been charged in relation to the so-called ‘Rabaa massacre’,"" Bachelet said.
A law passed in July gives Sisi the right to name officers who are eligible for immunity from investigation of offences alleged to have been committed while Egypt's constitution was suspended between Mursi's overthrow on July 3, 2013, and the reconvening of parliament on Jan. 10, 2016.
""Justice must apply to all – no one should be immune,” Bachelet said.

""I urge the Government of Egypt to ensure that justice will be done, according to law, in relation to any individuals – including members of the state security forces – who are suspected of committing a crime.”

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A United Nations climate change meeting in Bangkok made good progress on drafting a 'rule book' for the implementation of the 2015 Paris accord before a summit in Poland this December, a top U.N. official said on Sunday, the last day of the talks.
The Paris agreement, which was adopted by almost 200 nations and is due to come into force in 2020, set a sweeping goal of ending the fossil fuel era this century.
""We made good progress, but we cannot sit back, we need to continue to speed up and deepen the conversation,"" Patricia Espinosa, who leads the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which steers the talks, told a news conference in the Thai capital.
The negotiated text lays down the groundwork for a summit in Katowice from Dec. 2-14 at which governments will meet to agree rules on implementing the accord.
The UNFCCC earlier this week agreed to add an extra day to the December talks to allow more work to be done.  
""We need a streamlined draft that will assist us in Poland,"" Philip S. Weech, a delegate from the Group of 77 and China, told fellow negotiators earlier in the day.
Espinosa would discuss some fundamental issues with G7 environment ministers next week, she said. 
Negotiations, however still needed to ""achieve full clarity in climate finance,"" Espinosa said, referring to a $100 billion fund to help developing countries tackle climate change, describing funding as a ""politically sensitive"" issue.
Critics say that developed countries remained uncommitted over finance.  
""The U.S. is a major culprit in taking finance off the table,” Lidy Nacpil, coordinator at non-governmental organization the Asian Peoples Movement on Debt and Development, told reporters.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who in the past has described climate change as a hoax, pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement in 2017, saying it favored other countries and was disadvantageous to the United States.

The blast, which wounded at least two people, came hours after another suspected suicide bomber was shot by police in Kabul before he could detonate his device.
Earlier, gunfire could be heard across the city as demonstrators fired automatic weapons in aggressive displays of support for Massoud, an ethnic Tajik leader who was killed by suicide bombers in 2001.
With parliamentary elections approaching next month and rivalry between Afghanistan's ethnic groups on the increase, the annual commemoration day for Massoud has created a tense atmosphere in Kabul, where major roads were blocked by police.
The blast came four days after more than 20 people were killed by a suicide bomber at a wrestling club in Kabul as well as a secondary blast apparently aimed at first responders and journalists.

They said Syrian army helicopters dropped barrel bombs - typically filled with high explosives and shrapnel - on al-Habeet and Abdin villages in southern Idlib and a string of other hamlets and villages in the area.
The Syrian army denies using barrel bombs. However, United Nations investigators have extensively documented their use by the army.
Russian jets were believed to have hit the nearby towns of Latamneh and Kafr Zeita in northern Hama in a succession of raids, an organization which monitors air strikes in Syria and a rebel source said.
Damascus, backed by allies Russia and Iran, has been preparing a major assault to recover Idlib and adjacent areas of the northwest. The province is Syria's last major stronghold of active opposition to the rule of President Bashar al-Assad. 
Russian and Syrian warplanes have resumed their bombing campaign a day after a summit of the presidents of Turkey, Iran and Russia on Friday failed to agree on a ceasefire that would forestall the offensive.
Turkey and Western powers have warned of a bloodbath if a major Russian-backed bombing campaign is launched in the heavily populated northwestern province that borders Turkey.
The United Nations also said it feared a full-scale offensive could cause a humanitarian catastrophe involving tens of thousands of civilians. 
So far the aerial strikes have not hit a major city in the province where over three million civilians, many displaced from other areas, have found refuge in the course of the conflict.
Russia says it avoids civilians and only targets radical al Qaeda-inspired groups but opposition sources and residents say most of the casualties in the last few days were civilians.
The opposition accuse Russia and its allies of striking at hospitals and civil defense centers to force rebels to surrender in a repeat of earlier, large-scale military offensives.
A U.S.-based medical charity that operates in the provinces said three hospitals and two civil defense centers were bombed in the last two days, ""leaving thousands with no access to medical care"".

""It is distressing to see a rise in attacks on medical facilities...There are over three million civilians in this crowded area of Syria who are in a life-threatening situation,"" Ghanem Tayara, head of Union of Medical Care and Relief Organisations (UOSSM) said in a statement.

1578,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 09, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>","Pope should not resign, but church abuse tribunal needed: Bannon","By Crispian Balmer
ROME (Reuters) - Pope Francis should not resign over allegations he mishandled a sexual abuse scandal, said Steve Bannon, President Donald Trump's former political strategist who is close to prominent Catholic conservatives.
However, Bannon told Reuters he was working on setting up an independent, non-partisan tribunal to investigate decades of scandals within the U.S. Church, warning that dioceses across the country faced financial ruin because of the wrongdoing.
In a statement that stunned the church, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano said last month that Pope Francis should stand down for allegedly covering up for a former U.S. cardinal who was accused of sexually molesting children and adult seminarians.
Some media saw the hands of fierce conservative critics of Francis behind the unprecedented attack on a living pope, including U.S. Cardinal Raymond Burke, who is close to Bannon. 
Burke told reporters in Rome last week that he was ""deeply shaken"" by Vigano's accusations and called for an investigation. But Bannon, himself a Catholic, clearly distanced himself from Vigano, saying a papal resignation was not appropriate.
""This is as serious as it gets. We can't have memos and letters and accusations. The pope is from an unbroken chain the Vicar of Christ on Earth. You don't just sit there and say 'I think you should resign',"" said Bannon during a visit to Rome.
Instead, he said an independent tribunal had to be created to look into every aspect of the multiplying scandals.
""Until we do that, I don't think people should be snapping to judgments. This is so serious. This is an existential threat to the heart of the institution of the Catholic Church. It is not about doctrine or dogma of the Church,"" he said.
""WITCHHUNT""
Pope Francis has refused to comment on Vigano's attack, which was the latest blow to the credibility of the Church.
Last month, a grand jury in Pennsylvania released the findings of the largest-ever investigation of sex abuse in the U.S. Catholic Church, finding that 301 priests in the state had sexually abused minors over the past 70 years. Other U.S. states have also launched wide-ranging investigations of their own.
Bannon predicted the Church would have to pay millions of dollars in damages, compensation and legal fees. ""You are going to see a tremendous financial liquidation of the Church over the next 10, 15 or 20 years predicated on this scandal,"" he said.
Since his election in 2013, conservatives have sharply criticized Francis, saying he has left many faithful confused by pronouncements that the Church should be more welcoming to homosexuals and divorced Catholics and not be obsessed by ""culture war"" issues such as abortion.
During his time in Rome, Bannon met the head of Dignitatis Humanae Institute (DHI) -- a conservative, Catholic-inspired group based in Italy that he supports.
He said he was in contact with ""prominent people"" in the United States to set up a tribunal and believed it was too important to leave the Church itself to review its failings.

""This has nothing to do with whether you are a liberal Catholic or right-wing traditionalist ... It can't be seen as a political witchhunt."" he said.

Iraqi Kurdish officials said Iran attacked the base of an Iranian Kurdish armed opposition group in northern Iraq on Saturday, killing at least 11 people and wounding scores more.
""In a successful operation, the Guards' aerospace unit, along with the army's drone unit ... targeted a criminal group's meeting and a terrorist training center with seven short-range surface-to-surface missiles,"" the Revolutionary Guards said in a statement carried by the semi-official news agency Fars. 
The statement said the attack was prompted by a decision of ""group leaders to ignore serious warnings by officials of the Kurdistan Regional Government about Iran's determination to dismantle their bases ... and the need for an end to terrorist and aggressive actions against Iran"".
Armed Iranian Kurdish groups operate in remote and mountainous Iran-Iraq border regions. Despite sporadic clashes between Iranian forces and militants, there is little coordination between Iranian and Iraqi forces over security of an area that has also been used by Islamic State to enter Iran.
The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, an armed opposition group fighting for greater autonomy for Iran's Kurdish community, posted on Twitter pictures and video of explosions, as well as of the wounded, at its headquarters in Koya, in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region.
Turkey has also ramped up air strikes on Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) bases in northern Iraq this year. It routinely targets the PKK stronghold in the Qandil mountains, near the border with Iran, where Ankara suspects high-ranking members of the militant group are located.

Several crashes have occurred in war-torn South Sudan in recent years. In 2017, four passengers were injured after bad weather caused their plane to crash into a fire truck upon landing and burst into flames.
In 2015, dozens of people were killed when a Russian-built cargo plane with passengers on board crashed after taking off from the airport in Juba.

""This is early and we've not yet fully examined the scene. We understand that there are adults and children involved,"" Western Australia Police Assistant Commissioner Paul Steel told a news conference.
Steel said up to five bodies had been found at the scene when police arrived at noon. Investigators were still there.
""I can say there was at least one woman but I can't say more than that I'm afraid. The scene has not yet been forensically examined so the exact number of adults and children is actually unknown to me,"" Steel said.
He did not say how the people were killed or if any weapons were found.
A man in his twenties was helping police with their inquiries, he said, adding there was no danger to the public.
Violent crime with multiple victims is rare in Australia but this was the second major incident in Western Australia this year.
Seven people were shot and killed in the state in May.
Gun crime in Australia fell sharply after strict controls were introduced in response to a mass shooting in 1996, when a lone gunman killed 35 people in Tasmania.

Kosovo, which has a population of 1.8 million and is mainly ethnic Albanian, declared independence from Belgrade in 2008, almost a decade after NATO air strikes ousted Serbian forces and halted a crackdown on ethnic Albanians in a counter-insurgency.
It is now recognized by more than 100 nations but not by Serbia, Russia and five EU states.
A minority of Kosovo's remaining Serbians live in small enclaves in areas mainly populated by Albanians who account for more than 90 percent of the Kosovo population. The majority of Kosovo's Serbs live in northern areas bordering Serbia and do not recognize Pristina institutions. 
""Vucic should apologise for crimes committed and massacres all over Kosovo,"" said one banner on the road to Banje, which was blocked by cars and a truck. 
""Vucic will not pass,"" another read. 
The Serbian president had told reporters in the morning that he will try to use a bypass road to visit the village.
Normalizing bilateral ties is a key condition for both Kosovo and Serbia to advance towards their eventual goal of EU membership.

Expectations of an agreement that would involve a land swap proposed by both Belgrade and Pristina dimmed after a face-to-face meeting between Vucic and his Kosovo counterpart, Hashim Thaci, was abruptly canceled on Friday.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - China is participating for the first time in Australia's largest maritime exercise as more than 3,000 personnel from 27 countries engage in joint training off the strategic northern port of Darwin.
Exercise Kakadu is hosting 23 ships and submarines from across the Indo-Pacific region, enabling them to establish familiarity which helps to prevent conflict on the high seas and to coordinate disaster relief efforts.
Commander Anita Sellick of the Australian frigate HMAS Newcastle said two Royal Australian Navy sailors were accepted onto China's naval frigate Huangshan during the drill.
""Two of our Australian navy sailors are across actually, right now in the Chinese ship. So they've both been able to integrate within each other's navy and learn a little bit of what life is like for them today in Exercise Kakadu,"" Sellick told Reuters on Saturday.
Commander of the Australian Fleet, Rear Admiral Jonathan Mead, told reporters in Darwin in a televised interview on Friday that there were mutual benefits in building understanding and trust during the exercise.
The joint military practice, which will continue until Sept. 15, is supported by the Royal Australian Air Force and involves 21 aircraft.
Darwin, on the doorstep of Asia, is Australia's most strategically important city and has been home to a contingent of U.S. Marines since 2011 making it the logical place for the exercise. 
Integrating the People's Liberation Army Navy into the biennial training with American, Australian, New Zealand and Canadian forces for the first time has given China an opportunity to improve its working relationship with those countries, which has been tense at times.
In April, three Australian warships had a challenging encounter with China as they passed through the South China Sea. Then in May, the United States disinvited China from joint naval exercises off Hawaii in response to what it called China's militarization of disputed areas of the South China Sea, an allegation Beijing rejects.

The participating countries in Exercise Kakadu are: China, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, Canada, Chile, Cook Islands, Fiji, France, India, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, The Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, East Timor, Tonga, United Arab Emirates, U.S., Australia, and Vietnam.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's ruling coalition is facing a major defeat in a state by-election after voters vented their frustration over recent political infighting that led to a change in prime minister.
Rural voters in Wagga Wagga, an agricultural electorate in New South Wales (NSW), posted a 29 per cent swing against the Liberal Party in first preference voting, according to Australian Electoral Commission figures on Sunday, in a result that will strip the party of the rural seat for the first time since 1956.
Independent candidate, Joe McGirr, was expected to win with a leading primary vote of 24.69 percent, although counting will continue on Monday to confirm the result.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian conceded defeat on behalf of the party in a news conference, saying her government had heard the ""strong message"" the voters had sent.
The by-election has been seen as the first test of sentiment since new Prime Minister Scott Morrison took over leadership of the ruling Liberal-National coalition last month following a backbench revolt.
Deputy leader, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, told the ABC's Insider's program the loss was due to ""local factors"".
Stewart Jackson, politics lecturer at the University of Sydney said the by-election result indicated voter anger.
""There's a certain anger in the rural areas in any case overlaid by problems with the Liberal brand and National brand,"" he told Reuters by telephone. 
""In terms of the federal level, there's instability of leadership and federal instability in other policy areas, particularly energy is one of the key elements.""
The new prime minister faces a test on Monday as he steers the government through a hostile session of parliament where he is expected to be challenged about allegations of Liberal Party bullying, particularly of women. 
Former deputy leader Julie Bishop criticized her Liberal Party colleagues over the fact that less than 25 percent of the party's members of parliament were women.
Bishop, in her first public comments since resigning as foreign minister, said the turmoil had ""given rise to a much broader debate about the workplace culture in Canberra, with allegations of bullying and intimidation, harassment and coercion, and the unfair, unequal treatment of women"".
Frydenberg said any discussion of bullying would remain internal.

""What we do have is a problem in the Liberal Party, which I'm determined, and Scott Morrison is determined to address, which is to get more female representation,"" he said.

Germany's two biggest and most established parties have had a torrid summer, blighted by infighting over immigration that is flaring up again after violent right-wing protests in the eastern city of Chemnitz followed the fatal stabbing of a German man, for which two migrants were arrested.
The survey by pollster Emnid for the weekly newspaper Bild am Sonntag had support for Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and their Bavarian allies, the Christian Social Union (CSU), down by one percentage point on the week to 29 percent.
In last September's federal election, the CDU/CSU bloc won 32.9 percent of the vote.
The poll put support for the SPD down two points to 17 percent. In the last election, the SPD won 20.5 percent of the vote.
Their combined score of 46 percent was the lowest for any CDU/CSU/SPD coalition - a combination that also held power in 2005-09 and 2013-17 - in Emnid's poll for the Bild am Sonntag. The pollster surveyed 2,472 voters between Aug. 30 and Sept. 5.

The UNHCR recommended “the immediate use of the Gathering and Departure Facility in Tripoli, which will serve as a platform to find safety in third countries”.
The facility is ready to use and can host 1,000 vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers and is to be managed by the Ministry of Interior and the UNHCR, the agency said in a statement.
Recent fighting pitted two of the capital’s largest armed groups - the Tripoli Revolutionaries’ Brigades and the Nawasi - against the Seventh Brigade from Tarhouna, a town 65 km (45 miles) southeast of Tripoli.
Refugees and asylum seekers in the city are exposed to atrocities including rape, kidnapping and torture, the UNHCR said.
One woman said that unknown criminals kidnapped her husband and then raped her and tortured her one-year-old baby, the agency said.
It also said the detention centers from which the refugees fled remained at risk of being hit by rockets.
Conflicts among militias are at the heart of a conflict that has divided Libya since an uprising which forced leader Muammar Gaddafi from power seven years ago.
The UNHCR also called for action to hold smugglers and traffickers accountable after receiving “reliable reports” that they impersonate UNHCR staff at disembarkation platforms and migrant hubs.

“UNHCR information comes from refugees who report having been sold to traffickers in Libya, and subjected to abuse and torture, including after having been intercepted at sea,” it said, adding that investigations of these allegations are ongoing.

Wilders, speaking on the sidelines of a conference in Italy, expressed shock over the attack, in which a man stabbed and injured two American tourists at Amsterdam's central station. Dutch media identified the assailant as a 19-year-old Afghan.
The attack came after Wilders canceled plans to hold the cartoon competition, which had also drawn a complaint by Pakistan's new foreign minister, who said cartoon depictions of the Prophet could incite hate and intolerance.
""For now I will not be doing it soon again, for sure,"" Wilders told Reuters at the Ambrosetti conference, where he had been invited to speak on the future of the European Union.
""On the one hand you say that you should never give in to people who threaten to use violence against freedom of speech,"" he said, adding that he had spent 15 years living in safe houses and escorted by a security detail due to constant death threats.

Trump has said he would meet Iran's leaders.

Athens and Skopje reached an deal in June ending years of acrimony between the two countries over the name of the tiny Balkan state, but it has triggered a furious response from many Greeks.
On Saturday, police fired teargas at a group of individuals who broke away from a main group of demonstrators and hurled stones at riot police. 
State TV showed images of riot police chasing protesters close to barriers erected around a commercial park where an annual trade fair was taking place. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was due to deliver a policy address later at the heavily guarded venue.
Police sources estimated the number of protesters at more than 15,000, many waving the white and blue Greek flag.
Greece has been at odds with Macedonia since 1991 over the name of the Balkan state, arguing it could imply territorial claims over its province of the same name, and an appropriation of ancient Greek culture and civilization.
Thessaloniki is the capital of Greece's northern province of Macedonia. 
The country Macedonia has called a referendum on Sept. 30 on the agreement with Greece to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia. But many Greeks oppose any name that includes Macedonia.

On Saturday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Macedonians to embrace the deal with Greece in order to secure membership of NATO and the European Union.

GAZIVODA LAKE, Kosovo (Reuters) - Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic pledged to continue talks with Kosovo officials to resolve differences but warned it would take a long time to reach a broad deal with Pristina that could allow both nations to move toward EU membership.
Expectations of an agreement that would involve a land swap, a proposal floated by both Belgrade and Pristina, dimmed after a face-to-face meeting between Vucic and his Kosovo counterpart, Hashim Thaci, was abruptly canceled on Friday.
""I will do my best (to reach the agreement), but it is a long road full of thorns and problems ahead,"" Vucic told reporters during a visit to the Gazivoda Lake dam, control of which is a hot topic between Belgrade and Pristina. 
Part of the artificial Gazivoda Lake -- key for supplying water to some Kosovo municipalities including parts of Pristina -- is located in Serbia, where the source of its water lies.
Belgrade and Pristina are at odds who should have control over the lake, most of which is located in the northern Kosovo region mainly populated by Serbs, and a hydroelectric power plant next to it. 
""I don't think of Thaci as a friend or companion or good interlocutor and I am sure he has the same opinion about me. But we do need to talk and to try and reach the agreement,"" Vucic told reporters at the Gazivoda Lake in Kosovo. 
The land swap deal would allow Serbia to keep control over northern parts of Kosovo that are mainly populated by Serbs. In return, Belgrade would hand southern municipalities mainly populated by ethnic Albanians to Kosovo. 
Although some European Union and U.S. officials have said they are open to the proposal, Germany and many analysts have rejected it on the grounds that it would revive old hostilities in the Balkans that erupted during ethnic wars in the 1990s. 
""It is not going to be easy to reach an (final) agreement,"" Vucic said. ""I see no possibility to implement my ideas, you saw what Angela Merkel said, you saw what Kosovo Albanians have said.""
During a visit to Macedonia on Saturday, Merkel repeated her position that borders in the Balkans should not change. The deal also faces resistance from Kosovo's ruling coalition and opposition. 
Serbia lost control over Kosovo in 1999 after NATO bombed to stop killing and expulsion of Albanians by Serb forces during a two-year counter insurgency war. Kosovo declared independence in 2008 and has been recognized by 100 states, including five EU members and Russia, but not by Serbia.

Normalizing bilateral ties is a key condition for both nations to advance toward their eventual goal of EU membership.

CAIRO (Reuters) - An Egyptian court sentenced 75 people to death on Saturday including prominent Islamist leaders Essam al-Erian and Mohamed Beltagi over a 2013 sit-in which ended with security forces killing hundreds of protesters.
The sentencing, which included jail terms for more than 600 others, concluded a mass trial of people accused of murder and inciting violence during the pro-Muslim Brotherhood protest at Rabaa Adawiya square in Cairo. 
The decision can be appealed within 60 days.
Rabaa square was the single most deadly incident in unrest which followed the 2011 popular uprising that toppled Egypt's longtime leader Hosni Mubarak. 
It occurred weeks after the military ousted Egypt's first freely elected head of state, Islamist president Mohamed Mursi.
The government says many protesters were armed and that eight members of the security forces were killed.
Rights groups say more than 800 protesters died. Amnesty International condemned Saturday's decision, calling the trial ""disgraceful"".
Those sentenced to jail included a U.S. citizen, Moustafa Kassem, rights group Pretrial Rights International said. Washington is Cairo's closest Western ally and one of its top aid donors. 
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Saturday met U.S. Central Command chief General Joseph Votel as the two countries launched a joint military exercise off Egypt's Mediterranean coast.
In Saturday's hearing at the vast Tora prison complex south of Cairo, a criminal court sentenced to death by hanging several prominent Islamists including senior Brotherhood leaders al-Erian and Beltagi and preacher Safwat Higazi.
Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Mohamed Badie and dozens more were given life sentences, judicial sources said. Others received jail sentences ranging from five to 15 years.
Cases were dropped against five people who died while in prison, judicial sources said.
Following weeks of protests against the ouster of Islamist President Mursi by the military, which at the time was led by current president Sisi, security forces violently broke up the Rabaa square demonstration.
They arrested hundreds of people who were charged with inciting violence, murder and organizing illegal protests.
'MOCKERY OF JUSTICE'
Rights groups have criticized the trial for including many peaceful protesters and journalists.
An award-winning photographer who covered the protests, Mahmoud Abu Zeid, was sentenced to five years in jail, but would soon be released because his five years in detention during the trial are counted toward the sentence, judicial sources said.
Abu Zeid, also known as Shawkan, was awarded a UN World Press Freedom Prize this year. He was charged with belonging to a banned group and possessing firearms.
""We condemn today's verdict in the strongest terms,"" Amnesty International said in a statement. ""The fact that not a single police officer has been brought to account ... shows what a mockery of justice this trial was.""
Since Sisi was elected president in 2014, authorities have justified a crackdown on dissent and freedoms as being directed at militants and saboteurs trying to undermine the state.
Death sentences have been handed down to hundreds of his political opponents on charges such as belonging to an illegal organization or planning to carry out an attack. Often the sentences are not carried out, but rights groups say hangings have increased in recent years, with dozens taking place each year.
For executions to take place, Sisi must issue a final approval.
Supporters say a security crackdown is needed to stabilize Egypt, which still faces an Islamist insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula and is reeling financially from years of unrest.
Critics say the erosion of freedoms and silencing of political opponents is the worst Egypt has seen in its modern history.

BASRA/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Basra airport was attacked with rockets on Saturday after another night of protests against Iraq's political elite, during which demonstrators set fire to the Iranian consulate and briefly took oilfield workers hostage.
Iraq's second city has been rocked by five days of demonstrations, in which government buildings have been ransacked and set alight by protesters angry over political corruption. Protests first erupted in July over poor government services, but intensified this week. 
Organizers of the demonstrations said they would pause on Saturday, but there was still a heavy presence of security forces in the city of more than 2 million people as a curfew resumed at 4 p.m. (1300 GMT), with streets emptying out.
Security sources said three Katyusha rockets fired by unknown assailants had hit the perimeter of the airport, although no damage or casualties had been reported. The U.S. consulate is adjacent to the airport.
An airport official said there had been no disruption to operations.
The attack came shortly after the overnight curfew was lifted and hours after the reopening of Iraq's main seaport, Umm Qasr, which protesters had paralyzed by blocking its entrance.
On Friday, protesters broke into the Iranian consulate, shouting condemnation of what many see as Iran's sway over Iraq's affairs, and set it alight. Iran and Iraq both strongly condemned the move, raising fears of possible retribution.
Another group of protesters entered a water treatment facility linked to the West Qurna 2 oilfield and held two workers hostage for about an hour before leaving peacefully. Production was not disrupted, a manager at the oilfield said.
POLITICAL INFIGHTING
Residents in Basra say they have been driven onto the streets by corruption and misrule that have allowed infrastructure to collapse, leaving no power or safe drinking water. 
The crisis comes at a time when politicians still have not agreed on a government after an inconclusive election in May. The new parliament met for the first time on Monday, but failed to elect a speaker, much less name a prime minister.
Parliament convened an emergency session on Saturday to discuss the crisis in Basra and the current prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, warned that the situation could descend into armed conflict. 
""Politics should be separated from security and services,"" he said. 
Nevertheless, leaders of all the major blocs vying to form a ruling coalition criticized one another's roles in the crisis.
Following the session, the two largest electoral blocs, the Conquest Coalition and Sairoun, called on Abadi to resign.
Sairoun is led by Moqtada al-Sadr, a populist Shi'ite cleric whose electoral bloc came first in May's election, who has allied himself with Abadi. 
Their alliance is competing to form a new government against the Conquest Coalition, backed by Abadi's predecessor Nuri al-Maliki and the leader of an Iran-backed Shi'ite armed group, Hadi al-Amiri. Amiri first called for Abadi to resign on Friday.
Three protesters died on Friday and 48 more were wounded, 26 of whom were shot, sources said, while two members of the security force were wounded.
At least 13 protesters have died, some in clashes with security forces, since Monday.
At a cabinet meeting, ministers agreed to send a delegation to Basra, and Abadi said he had ordered an investigation into the security forces ""for not fulfilling their duties"" in protecting government buildings and the Iranian consulate.

The heads of Basra Operations Command and the Basra Police were both sacked on Saturday.

1595,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2018 12:35PM ET</span>",Russian and Syrian jets pound Idlib province after summit,"By Suleiman Al-Khalidi
AMMAN (Reuters) - Russian and Syrian warplanes pounded towns in Syria's opposition-held Idlib province on Saturday, a day after a summit of the presidents of Turkey, Iran and Russia failed to agree on a ceasefire that would forestall a Russian-backed offensive.
Idlib is Syria's last major stronghold of active opposition to the rule of President Bashar al-Assad.
At least a dozen air strikes hit a string of villages and towns in southern Idlib and the town of Latamneh and Kafr Zeita in northern Hama where rebels are still in control, witnesses and rescuers said.
Syrian helicopters dropped so-called barrel bombs -- containers filled with explosive material -- on homes on the outskirts of the city of Khan Sheikhoun in southern Idlib, two residents said.
The Syrian army denies using barrel bombs. However, United Nations investigators have extensively documented their use by the army.
The Western-sponsored Syrian Civil Defence rescue service known as the White Helmets said they pulled four bodies, including a child, from the rubble of a building bombed by Russian planes in the village of Abdeen, near Khan Sheikhoun. 
Russia says it avoids civilians and only targets radical al Qaeda inspired groups but opposition sources and residents say most of the casualties in the last few days were civilians.
The opposition accuse Russia and its allies of striking at hospitals and civil defense centers to paralyze life and force rebels to surrender in a repeat of earlier, large-scale military offensives.
Hundreds of civilians were killed in Russian-backed bombing campaigns on the former besieged rebel stronghold of Ghouta near the capital Damascus this year and a recent offensive in southern Syria displaced tens of thousands.
A hospital in the town of Hass was put out of service after it was bombed, a rescue worker said.
Idlib's two main rebel coalitions, the mainstream nationalist National Liberation Front, and a jihadist grouping known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, spearhead by a former al-Qaeda offshoot, say they were putting aside ideological differences to face a common threat.
Rebels say the battle could be decisive and a defeat may bring the end of their over seven-year, armed rebellion against Assad.
""There is coordination and cooperation with all the fighting factions to defend our people,"" Emad al Din Mojahed, spokesman for Hayat Tahrir al Sham, told Reuters.
SUMMIT FAILS TO BRING TRUCE 
Friday's summit had focused on a looming military operation in Idlib. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan pushed for a ceasefire during the summit but Russian President Vladimir Putin said a truce would be pointless as it would not involve Islamist militant groups Assad and his allies deem as terrorists.
Tehran and Moscow have helped Assad turn the course of the war against an array of opponents ranging from Western-backed rebels to Islamist militants, while Turkey is a leading opposition supporter and has troops in the country. 
The United Nations fears a full-scale offensive could cause a humanitarian catastrophe involving tens of thousands of civilians.
The White House said this week that U.S. President Donald Trump had warned that such attacks would be “a reckless escalation of an already tragic conflict” and “risk the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.""
A U.S. State Department official said Washington was aware of reports of Russian and Syrian air strikes in Idlib in spite of warnings from the United States, the UN and others, and was closely monitoring the situation. 
“Russia claims that it is targeting terrorists, but observers reported that only civilian casualties resulted from the strikes,” the official said. 
“This demonstrates that only a precise counterterrorism campaign can be effective. Indiscriminate regime and Russian military offensives will only continue to lead to humanitarian catastrophe,” the U.S. official added. 
The State Department official said the United States was continuing to engage the Russian government and military at senior levels “to make clear that such escalation must be avoided.”
The White House has warned that the United States and its allies would respond ""swiftly and vigorously"" if government forces used chemical weapons in the widely expected offensive. 
Tens of thousands of Syrians living in rebel-held towns in Idlib took to the streets on Friday to protest the impending campaign vowing they would never accept Assad's rule and would resist any offensive to retake opposition areas.

Congressman Jair Bolsonaro, who is unlikely to return to the campaign trail before the Oct. 7 first-round vote, was being fed intravenously but was in ""good clinical condition,"" according to a written statement from the Einstein hospital in Sao Paulo. 
The attack further complicates Brazil's most unpredictable election in three decades. Corruption investigations have jailed scores of powerful businessmen and politicians in recent years, and alienated infuriated voters. 
Bolsonaro, 63, has for years angered many Brazilians with extreme statements on race, gender and sexual preference, but is also seen by his many supporters as a politically incorrect gust of fresh air in a broken system.
Bolsonaro's son, Flavio, on Saturday posted on his verified Twitter account a photo of his father wearing a blue hospital gown and sitting in a bedside chair with tubes coming from his arms and nose. The law-and-order candidate was making his trademark ""guns up"" gesture, with both his hands resembling pistols. Flavio wrote that his father was in physical therapy. 
Police have a suspect in custody and say only that they are continuing the investigation and that no clear motive was yet known, though the assailant told police he stabbed Bolsonaro on Thursday on ""orders from God."" 

Surveys consistently give Bolsonaro, a member of the Social Liberal Party, around 22 percent in simulated first-round votes. However, those polls find he would badly lose to most rivals in the likely event of a runoff, which takes place if no candidate wins a majority in the first ballot.

The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), an armed opposition group fighting for greater autonomy for Iran's Kurdish community, tweeted pictures and video of explosions, as well as of the wounded, at its headquarters in Koya, in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region.
""According to initial reports, 11 people were killed and between 20 and 30 wounded,"" said Major General Jabbar Yawar, a spokesman for Iraq's Kurdish Peshmerga security forces.
""The strike targeted a conference held by the political office of the party this morning.""
He said the attack had come from Iranian territory, but that his government had not yet determined whether it had been air strikes or ground-based firing.
The Iranian Foreign Ministry could not be reached for comment, and there were no reports of the incident on the main Iranian news agencies.
The PDKI, on its verified Twitter account, said that ""Iran used long-range missiles in a coordinated attack on PDKI's bases and adjacent refugee camps"".
Yawar said the area that had been attacked included a residential complex for the families of party members.
Iran has in the past shelled armed Kurdish opposition groups based in Iraq.
On Friday, the PDKI said it had come under shelling on Thursday, but no casualties were reported. 
The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) condemned the shelling on Saturday, saying Kurdish laws and territorial integrity should be respected. 
Turkey has also ramped up air strikes on Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) bases in northern Iraq this year. It routinely targets the PKK stronghold in the Qandil mountains, near the border with Iran, where Ankara suspects high-ranking members of the militant group are located.

The fighting took place after a Syrian military convoy entered areas in the city which the Kurdish YPG militia's internal security forces said were under their control.
""They entered our areas of control and arrested civilians and members of the patrol targeted our forces,"" the internal security forces, known as the Asayish, said in a statement.
Kurdish forces said seven of its fighters and 11 Syrian military were killed in the clashes.
Pro-government sources told state media an army patrol was attacked by Kurdish forces while on its way to the airport. It said several troops were killed.
The Kurdish YPG militia, which spearheads the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), controls most of the city and pro-government forces holding the airport and part of its centre.
Fighting in Qamishli, near the Turkish border, which erupts occasionally, disturbs a peaceful co-existence where the Syrian state has slowly expanded its influence, residents say.
Syrian President Bashar al Assad has turned a blind eye to YPG control of Kurdish-populated cities since the 2011 uprising in which his army has focused on fighting mainly Sunni rebel factions seeking to topple his rule.
But the government has not ruptured ties with salaries of many state employees in these areas still paid and authorities still getting a share of proceeds from oilfields now under Kurd control.
The SDF has expanded beyond mainly Kurdish parts of the north, where the forces have carved out autonomous cantons since the onset of Syria's conflict.
The region they control spreads across much of northern and eastern Syria, which is rich in farmland, oil and water.
Senior members of the YPG have recently held talks with Syrian officials seeking a political deal which would retain their autonomy in Syria.

Macedonia has set Sept. 30 for the referendum on both the membership bids and its agreement with Greece to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
After meeting with Prime Minister Zoran Zaev in Skopje on Saturday, Merkel said the issues were ""very closely linked"".
""Without a solution to this (name) question, the other two things can't happen,"" she told journalists. 
In June, NATO invited Macedonia to begin accession talks with the alliance, but said it would have to change its constitution and adopt the new name first. The EU has also said it would set a date for Macedonian accession talks pending implementation of the name deal. 
Greece, a member of both NATO and the EU, has refused to accept the Balkan country's name, saying it implies territorial claims on the Greek province of Macedonia and amounts to an appropriation of its ancient civilization. It has blocked the country's membership bids.
Zaev's government, elected in 2017, pushed for an agreement with Greece and the two sides agreed on the new name in June. 
Macedonian nationalists, including President Gjorge Ivanov, oppose the deal however, saying it is against the constitution.
Zaev said Merkel's visit sent ""a strong message and encouragement"" to citizens ahead of the referendum ""to decide their future.""
""The future could be, with a successful outcome of the referendum, that you are both member of NATO as well as belonging to the family of EU states,"" Merkel said.
Her visit comes 27 years to the day after Macedonia declared independence from former Yugoslavia in 1991. It was the only former Yugoslav republic to break away peacefully.
Zaev's government needs a two-third majority in parliament to implement the constitutional changes. If the deal with Greece is rejected in the referendum, it would be more difficult for the government to win this majority. 

According to recent opinion polls, more than 50 percent of people are likely to vote, with the majority supporting the membership bids and the name deal.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Yemen peace talks collapsed on Saturday after three days of waiting for the Houthi movement delegation, but the United Nations envoy vowed to press ahead with diplomacy. 
The Houthi's failure to come to Geneva for the first talks in three years was ""the elephant in the room"", but did not signify the peace process was deadlocked, U.N. Special Envoy Martin Griffiths said. 
Griffiths, who held three days of talks with a Yemeni government delegation, said he would meet in coming days with the Houthi leadership in Sanaa and Muscat, Oman.
""They would have like to get here, we didn't make conditions sufficiently correct to get them here,"" Griffiths told a news conference, declining to elaborate.
The Houthi group said on Friday it was still waiting for the United Nations to guarantee that the flight carrying its delegation to Geneva would not be inspected by Saudi coalition forces and could evacuate some of its wounded. 
Griffiths, referring to peace processes, said on Saturday: ""A restart is a very delicate, fragile moment. People are coming at a time when perhaps all of their constituencies are not fully engaged and don't see ahead of time results that will come out of talks.
""So I don't take this as a fundamental blockage in the process,"" he added.
Confidence-building measures such as prisoner releases, increasing humanitarian access, especially to the city of Taiz, and reopening Sanaa airport were discussed with the government, he said.
Agreement has been reached for medical evacuations from the Houthi-held Yemeni capital of Sanaa, to start in a week with a flight to Cairo, he said, calling it an ""early achievement"".
A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen's war against the Houthis in 2015 with the aim of restoring the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The humanitarian situation has worsened sharply since, putting 8.4 million people on the brink of starvation and ruining the already weak economy.
Yemeni foreign minister Khaled al-Yamani, who led the government delegation, accused the Houthis of being ""totally irresponsible"" and of ""trying to sabotage the negotiations"". 
""If they were sincere in reaching peace, they should have come, even if we were meeting in separate rooms,"" he told a separate news conference before leaving the Swiss city.
Yamani also strongly criticized Griffiths, who took over as mediator in February.
""We want the U.N. to be firmer in bringing the other party to the negotiations,"" he said.

Anwar Gargash, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs for the United Arab Emirates, a key member of the Saudi-led coalition of Sunni Arab states, tweeted: ""Despite the serious setback in Geneva the way forward is still a political solution. What is perhaps clearer now to the international community is the unwillingness of the Houthis to engage in good faith with such a process.""

""We have a portfolio of orders worth more than $1 billion,"" TASS cited Dmitry Shugayev, head of Russian Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation, as saying on Thursday.
The report came during a visit to Russia by Nguyen Phu Trong, the general secretary of Vietnam's Communist Party.
It did not give any details of the deals.
Vietnam and Russia have had close relations for decades.
Russia is Vietnam's biggest weapons supplier and Russian companies are involved in several Vietnamese energy projects.
Vietnam had earlier bought six state-of-the-art Kilo attack submarines, along with several warships, jet fighters and other military equipment from Russia.
""The two sides have confirmed their commitment to continue developing their military ties,"" Vietnam's Communist Party said in a statement on Friday, after a meeting in Russia between Trong and Russian President Vladamir Putin.
Vietnam has been one of the world's most active arms importers over recent years, amid China's increasingly aggressive territorial claims in the South China Sea, where the neighbors have long-standing rival claims.
Vietnamese and Russian companies signed several cooperation agreements during Trong's visit, including three on banking cooperation, according to the Vietnamese government.

Trust is used by independent pollster Social Weather Stations (SWS) to gauge public opinion with a president’s personality.
It fell 8 points in the second quarter to +57 from +65 in an earlier poll. It was the popular leader's lowest score in nine surveys taken since he took office in June 2016.
To reach each rating, the surveys subtract the percentage who respond with “low trust” in Duterte from those who said they had ""much trust"" in him.
SWS surveyed 1,200 people at the end of June, in a week when Duterte called God ""stupid"" during a verbal assault on the Catholic Church after top priests criticized his bloody anti-narcotics campaign, which has killed thousands of people.
The Philippines is majority Catholic.
Duterte again hit out at the church in a news conference on Saturday, calling priests' groups ""the most hypocritical institution in the Philippines today"", with the church facing child abuse cases in the Philippines and elsewhere.
Ramon Casiple, head of the Institute for Political and Electoral Reforms in Manila, said it was normal for a president's rating to fall at the two-year stage of his term.
The survey did not ask respondents to explain their rating. Duterte had enjoyed high trust ratings, peaking at +79 shortly after taking office.
Duterte did not mention the survey results on Saturday but a spokesman welcomed the support.
""We are now working double time to aid families affected by high prices while keeping the economy stable,"" presidential spokesman Harry Roque said in a statement.
Annual inflation reached its highest in nearly a decade in August, exceeding expectations and increasing the changes of a fourth interest rate rise this year.

Rosalinda Gonzalez, who in May was arrested on organized crime and money laundering charges, was freed from prison late on Thursday in the central state of Morelos, newspaper Reforma said, posting a video of what it said showed her release.
In the video, a woman in custody answering to her name is seen getting out of a vehicle and being discharged by an official. She then departs with a group of people waiting for her.
A spokesman for the Mexican attorney general's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Reforma said Gonzalez was granted release after bail of some 1.5 million pesos ($78,000) was paid, and still faced a money laundering trial. However, a judge had found insufficient evidence to prosecute her for organized crime, the paper added.
Last month, Mexican authorities said they were offering a 30 million peso reward for information leading to the capture of her husband Oseguera, who is known as ""El Mencho"".
In March, U.S. agents in Chicago named El Mencho public enemy No. 1 and blamed his gang for using ""extreme violence"" to expand their share of the heroin trade. The United States is offering $5 million for information leading to his capture.
His drug cartel, which is often referred to by its Spanish initials, CJNG, has become one of the most feared in Mexico, helping to push homicides in the country to record levels.
The gang based in western Mexico is blamed for sending large quantities of crystal meth and heroin to the United States, and has for the past few years battled the Sinaloa Cartel of captured kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman for supremacy.

1606,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2018 01:13AM ET</span>",Ex-Trump campaign aide Papadopoulos sentenced to 14 days in prison,"By Sarah N. Lynch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - George Papadopoulos, a former aide to then-Republican candidate Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, was sentenced on Friday to 14 days in prison after pleading guilty last year to lying to federal agents investigating whether campaign members coordinated with Russia before the election.
Prosecutors for Special Counsel Robert Mueller said Papadopoulos lied to agents about his contacts with Russians during the campaign ""to minimize both his own role as a witness and the extent of the campaign's knowledge of his contacts,"" according to the government's sentencing memorandum.
Among those contacts were London-based professor Joseph Mifsud, who told him the Russians had ""dirt"" on Trump's Democratic presidential rival Hillary Clinton in the form of ""thousands of emails.""
Papadopoulos defended himself and contradicted White House officials in a CNN special program Saturday night, ""The Mysterious case of George Papadopoulos.""
In the interview with CNN reporter Jake Tapper, Papadopoulos said that he raised the prospect of Trump and his campaign officials meeting with the Russians.
""The candidate (Trump) gave a nod, but did not commit either way,"" he said.
Trump has denied knowing anything about contact with Russians and his campaign.
Russia has denied U.S. allegations that it interfered in the campaign and Trump denies campaign collusion.
Prosecutors had asked Judge Randolph Moss in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to impose a prison sentence of up to six months, saying that Papadopoulos' lies impeded their investigation and that he did not cooperate.
""He didn't come close to the standard of 'substantial assistance,'"" prosecutor Andrew Goldstein told the judge at the sentencing hearing. ""It was at best, begrudging efforts to cooperate.""
In addition to the prison time, Papadopoulos was sentenced to one year of supervised release and 200 hours of community service. He was also ordered to pay a fine of $9,500. 
'TIME TO THINK'
Friday was his first public court appearance since he pleaded guilty in October 2017 to lying to the FBI while the case was still sealed.
""I hope to have a second chance to redeem myself,"" Papadopoulos told the judge. 
""I made a dreadful mistake but I am a good man.""
He and his wife left the courthouse without speaking to the press. However, Papadopoulos' mother Kiki told reporters she was satisfied he had received a fair sentence.
""I am very happy with the judge. He was very fair,"" Kiki Papadopoulos said. ""I would have preferred less time in jail, but that's OK. It will give him time to think things over.""
The White House distanced itself from Papadopoulos, referring to his campaign role as nothing more than a low-level coffee boy, after his guilty plea.
His mother said on Friday that she ""still supports"" Trump.
The sentence that Papadopoulos received is about half the prison time given to Alex van der Zwaan, a lawyer who was also charged with lying to the FBI during the special counsel's probe. Van der Zwaan was sentenced to 30 days in prison.
Moss said he wanted to impose some prison time because while he did not ""remotely believe Mr Papadopoulos was seeking to assist the Russian government,"" he was nevertheless troubled by Papadopoulos' selfish motives to lie to the FBI so that he would not lose a shot at getting a possible job in the Trump administration.
Ultimately, Moss said he felt Papadopoulos expressed genuine remorse. The judge who sentenced Van der Zwaan, by contrast, did not feel he was contrite about his crimes.
During Friday's hearing, Papadopoulos' attorney Thomas Breen went out his way to praise the FBI, and he also criticized Trump for calling the Russia probe fake news and a witch hunt.
""The president of the United States hindered this investigation more than George Papadopoulos ever could,"" Breen told the judge.
He portrayed Papadopoulos as a naive young man who was ""being worked by a pro,"" a reference to Professor Mifsud, whom he later said he believes was working for Russia and trying to take advantage of his client.
""No offense, but he was unsophisticated, he was naive and he was foolish,"" Breen said in court.
'ENTHUSIASTIC'
Breen told reporters after Friday's hearing that Papadopoulos does not recall telling anyone in the Trump campaign about Mifsud's comments about the Russians having dirt on Clinton.
The lies Papadopoulos told in his voluntary interview with the FBI on Jan. 27, 2017, prosecutors said, ""undermined investigators' ability to challenge the professor or potentially detain or arrest him while he was still in the United States.""
In addition, they said Papadopoulos did not provide ""substantial assistance"" and only came clean after he was confronted with his own emails, texts and other evidence.
In December 2017, two months after his guilty plea, the FBI had plans for a follow-up meeting with Papadopoulos. 
The FBI canceled the meeting when it discovered that Papadopoulos had sat down for a media interview about the case. He and his wife later participated in more media interviews.
Papadopoulos was pictured in March 2016 sitting at a table with Trump, then-campaign adviser Jeff Sessions who went on to become U.S. attorney general, and other foreign policy campaign advisers.
At that meeting, Papadopoulos proposed brokering a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Sessions has previously testified to Congress that he pushed back against the proposal, but the memo filed by Papadopoulos's lawyers contradicts Sessions' account, saying that both Trump and Sessions appeared receptive to the idea.
But Papadopoulos, referring to Sessions, said to CNN, ""I remember that he was enthusiastic about a potential meeting.""
CNN's Tapper noted that Session's attorneys said that Sessions stands by his testimony, and denied encouraging a meeting with Russians.
The court filing confirms reporting by Reuters in March about the difference between Sessions’ testimony and how others recounted his reaction to the proposal at the meeting.
Papadopoulos told CNN that he hopes to return to politics in the future.

""I made mistakes and I will pay for my mistakes,"" he said, adding, ""I don't want to give up my goal of staying in politics.""

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 08, 2018 12:16AM ET</span>",Power restored in most of Japan's quake-hit Hokkaido; Toyota plants to shut,"By Osamu Tsukimori
TOKYO (Reuters) - Power had been restored to almost all customers in the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido by early Saturday, two days after an earthquake caused an island-wide blackout and killed at least 21 people.
But the impact of Thursday's 6.7 magnitude quake was set to rumble on with Toyota Motor planning to halt operations at 16 of 18 domestic full-assembly plants due to a parts factory shutdown.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the confirmed death toll was 21, with six people in cardiopulmonary arrest - a term used in Japan to describe a victim's condition before death is officially confirmed - and 13 people were missing.
The earthquake triggered landslides that buried houses and paralyzed Hokkaido with widespread power and transport cuts, the latest natural disaster to hit Japan after typhoons, floods and deadly heat waves in the past two months.
Toyota Motor said it would suspend work at the 16 plants on Monday due to the shutdown of its transmission factory in Tomakomai in Hokkaido following the quake. 
The company said it would decide later on whether to extend the shutdowns beyond Monday.
Suga called on businesses and Hokkaido's 5.3 million residents to save power by about 10 percent from Monday, when usage rises, and said the government would likely resort to rolling blackouts if demand threatened to exceed supply capacity. 
That would be the first use of rolling blackouts in Japan to deal with power shortages since March 2011, when a magnitude 9 earthquake and tsunami caused the Fukushima nuclear disaster.
Hokkaido Electric said power supplies had been restored island-wide to 2.93 million customers by early Saturday, leaving only 20,000 customers without electricity.
The utility will have supplies of up to 3.6 GW available by the end of Saturday, the trade ministry said, which is still short of pre-quake peak demand of 3.8 GW.
Japanese refiner Idemitsu Kosan Co is preparing to resume truck product shipments at its 150,000 barrels-per-day Hokkaido refinery, a company official said. 

Refining operations have been halted since Thursday.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - America's top general on Saturday said he was involved in ""routine dialogue"" with the White House about military options should Syria ignore U.S. warnings against using chemical weapons in an expected assault on the enclave of Idlib.
Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said no decision had been made by the United States to employ military force in response to a future chemical attack in Syria. 
""But we are in a dialogue, a routine dialogue, with the president to make sure he knows where we are with regard to planning in the event that chemical weapons are used,"" he told a small group of reporters during a trip to India. Dunford later added: ""He expects us to have military options and we have provided updates to him on the development of those military options."" 
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has massed his army and allied forces on the front lines in the northwest, and Russian planes have joined his bombardment of rebels there, in a prelude to a widely expected assault despite objections from Turkey.
This week, a top U.S. envoy said there was ""lots of evidence"" that chemical weapons were being prepared by Syrian government forces in Idlib.
The White House has warned that the United States and its allies would respond ""swiftly and vigorously"" if government forces used chemical weapons in Idlib. President Donald Trump has twice bombed Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons, in April 2017 and April 2018.
Dunford did not say, one way or the other, what he expected Trump to do should Syria use chemical weapons again. 
France's top military official also said last week his forces were prepared to carry out strikes on Syrian targets if chemical weapons were used in Idlib.
Dunford declined to comment on U.S. intelligence about the possible Syrian preparations of chemical agents.
""I wouldn't comment on intelligence at all, in terms of what we have, what we don't have,"" he said.
'DISAPPOINTING'
Idlib is the insurgents' only remaining major stronghold and a government offensive could be the last decisive battle in a war that has killed more than half a million people and forced 11 million to flee their homes. 
The presidents of Turkey, Iran and Russia on Friday failed to agree on a ceasefire that would forestall an offensive. 
Asked whether there was still a chance the assault on Idlib could be averted, Dunford said: ""I don't know if there's anything that can stop it.""
""It's certainly disappointing but perhaps not (surprising) that the Russians, the Turks and the Iranians weren't able to come up with a solution yesterday,"" he said.
Tehran and Moscow have helped Assad turn the course of the war against an array of opponents ranging from Western-backed rebels to the Islamist militants, while Turkey is a leading opposition supporter and has troops in the country.
Turkey says it fears a massacre and it can not accommodate any more refugees flooding over its border. 
But Russia's Vladimir Putin said on Friday a ceasefire would be pointless as it would not involve Islamist militant groups it deems terrorists. 
Dunford has warned about the potential for a humanitarian catastrophe in Idlib and instead has recommended more narrowly tailored operations against militants there. ""There's a more effective way to do counterterrorism operations than major conventional operations in Idlib,"" he said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Tall ships carrying climate change banners sailed into Australia's Sydney Harbour on Saturday launching a wave of protest across 95 countries organized by New York-based lobby group 350.org.
Climate change is of great concern in the Pacific region with Pacific Island nations declaring on Friday that it is their ""single greatest threat"" and urging Washington to return to the Paris Agreement on climate.
350.org, which had revenue of $16.8 million according to its 2017 financial statements, has co-ordinated 850 events around the world by linking local organizations, which in Australia included Get Up!, Greenpeace and the Climate Action Network.
The protests have been timed to build climate change action ahead of the Global Climate Action Summit, 350.org said in a statement, where political, business and entertainment leaders including the Hungary President Janos Ader, Ikea Group chief executive Jesper Brodin and actor Harrison Ford are scheduled to speak.
The summit, whose sponsors include Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the United Nations and Bloomberg Philanthropies, is planned for September 12 to 14 in California, less than 60 days before the U.S. mid-term elections where climate is expected to be an issue.
U.S. based lobby watchdog InfluenceWatch.org says on its website that 350.org's closely related entity 350.org Action Fund almost exclusively supports Democratic politicians in U.S. elections. 
Chief executive of 350.org Australia Blair Palese said her organization does not engage in party-political lobbying.

""We really just call for action on climate across all parties and all countries ... just calling for the public to ask all candidates what their positions are on climate and what kind of action they're taking,"" she told Reuters by telephone on Saturday.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The Chinese government's top diplomat was in Pakistan on Saturday for the first high-level meetings between the neighbors since new Prime Minister Imran Khan took office, the south Asian nation's foreign office said. 
Beijing has pledged $57 billion in loans for Pakistan as part of its vast Belt and Road initiative, deepening ties at a time when Islamabad's relations with Washington are fraying over how to deal with Islamist militants waging war in Afghanistan.
State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi's three-day visit follows a meeting between Khan and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday. 
Wang will hold ""delegation-level talks"" with Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and will also call on the Prime Minister and Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa, the foreign office said. 
""Our two sides will exchange views on bilateral relations and the international and regional issues of mutual interest,"" Chinese foreign office spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a news conference in Beijing. 
Pakistan is battling a worsening balance of payments crisis that may push it to seek a fresh bailout from the International Monetary Fund, or other lenders. 

Pompeo's trip, along with the U.S. chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, was the first high-level U.S. visit to the new government, with the secretary of state saying he was hopeful for ""a reset of relations"" between the two countries.

Washington has expressed concern over the rising number of countries that have cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favor of China.
El Salvador switched ties last month, while the Dominican Republic did so in May and Panama made the move last year.
Self-ruled Taiwan now has formal relations with only 17 countries, almost all of them small and less developed nations in Central America and the Pacific, including Belize and Nauru.
Like most other countries, Washington does not have diplomatic relations with Taipei but is the democratic island's main arms supplier and strongest international backer.
The White House warned last month that China was luring countries with economic inducements that ""facilitate economic dependency and domination, not partnership.""
In a statement on Friday, the U.S. State Department said it had called back U.S. Ambassador to the Dominican Republic Robin Bernstein, U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador Jean Manes and U.S. Charge d'Affaires in Panama Roxanne Cabral ""for consultations related to recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan.""
It said the diplomats will meet with U.S. government leaders ""to discuss ways in which the United States can support strong, independent, democratic institutions and economies throughout Central America and the Caribbean.""
On Wednesday, U.S. senators introduced legislation that would authorize the State Department to downgrade U.S. relations with any government that shifts away from Taiwan, and to suspend or alter U.S. assistance.
China considers Taiwan to be a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.

(Reuters) - Immigrant parents separated from their children by the Trump administration and returned to their homes are refusing to be reunited with their children because their countries are so dangerous, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union told a court on Friday.
""We've had very difficult conversations with the parents this week,"" Lee Gelernt of the ACLU told a federal judge in San Diego. ""As much as they want to be with their child, and it's heartbreaking, they feel it's too dangerous.""
Gelernt told the court that he had spent time over the past week in Guatemala trying to locate parents of some of the roughly 300 children in U.S. care and found about two-thirds were refusing to have their child returned to them.
Gelernt said parents who refused to be reunited tended to have older children who could be recruited by violent gangs if they returned home. In addition, some children have relatives in the United States and are unlikely to end up in foster care.
The ACLU contacted parents in Central America of 162 children and said 109 refused reunification, according to a court filing.
U.S. authorities separated about 2,600 children from parents who had crossed the U.S. southern border with Mexico, many fleeing gang violence in Guatemala and Honduras. 
In late June, the administration was forced under intense global criticism to abandon the policy, which was aimed at discouraging illegal immigration. Soon after it was rescinded, U.S. Judge Dana Sabraw in San Diego ordered the children to be reunited with their parents.
Reunifications have slowed to a trickle, largely because about 300 parents were removed from the United States without their children. Immigration advocates have said it is difficult to find the parents because many live in remote areas of Central America or have gone into hiding. 
Gelernt said if the children failed to get U.S. asylum they would be reunited with their parents.

The Trump administration said on Thursday it plans to withdraw from a federal court agreement that strictly limits the conditions under which authorities can detain migrant children, and proposed new rules it said would enable it to detain minors during their immigration proceedings.

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump warned on Friday he was ready to slap tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports into the United States, threatening duties on another $267 billion of goods on top of $200 billion in imports primed for levies in coming days.
The moves would sharply escalate Trump's trade war with Beijing over his demands for major changes in economic, trade and technology policy. China has threatened retaliation, which could include action against U.S. companies operating there.
Hours after a public comment period closed on his $200 billion China tariff list, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he was ""being strong on China because I have to be.""
""The $200 billion we are talking about could take place very soon depending on what happens with them. To a certain extent it's going to be up to China,"" Trump said. ""And I hate to say this, but behind that is another $267 billion ready to go on short notice if I want. That totally changes the equation.""
Stock prices slipped after his comments, with the S&P 500 off 0.2 percent, while China's off-shore trade yuan currency fell against the dollar. [MKTS/GLOB]
Trump has already imposed 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, mostly industrial machinery and intermediate electronics parts, including semiconductors.
The $200 billion list, which includes some consumer products such as cameras and recording devices, luggage, handbags, tires and vacuum cleaners, would be subject to tariffs of 10 percent to 25 percent.
Cell phones, the biggest U.S. import from China, have so far been spared, but would be engulfed if Trump activates the $267 billion tariff list.
Trump's threatened tariffs, now totaling $517 billion in Chinese goods, would exceed the $505 billion in goods imported from China last year. But 2018 imports from China through July were up nearly 9 percent over the same period of 2017, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
Earlier on Friday, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Bloomberg Television the administration would evaluate public comments before making decisions on the $200 billion tariff list.
The U.S. Trade Representative's office received nearly 6,000 comments and held seven days of public hearings on the proposed levies.
Most comments were from companies seeking to remove products from the tariff list, arguing there were few, if any alternative sources and the duties would cause financial hardship. Comparatively few applauded the tariffs. 
Major technology company Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) said a ""wide range"" of its products would be hit by the tariffs, but not its iPhone. It said in a late submission that its AirPods headphones, some of Apple's Beats headphones, and its new HomePod smart speaker would face levies, causing its shares to slip in late trading. 
""Our concern with these tariffs is that the U.S. will be hardest hit, and that will result in lower U.S. growth and competitiveness and higher prices for U.S. consumers,"" Apple said in the letter.
Retailers had successfully kept high-profile consumer electronics such as cell phones and television sets off of previous tariff lists. But David French, top lobbyist for the National Retail Federation, whose members include Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) , BJ’s Wholesale Club and Macy’s, said nearly every consumer good could be affected if Trump follows through on all threatened tariffs.
""The Chinese aren't paying these tariffs, American families are going to pay these tariffs. These are taxes and they're going to find their way into the pocket book of folks around the country,"" French said.
STILL TALKING TO CHINA
Kudlow, who heads the National Economic Council, told CNBC the administration was still talking with China about trade issues but so far China had not met U.S. requests.
The United States has demanded that China better protect American intellectual property, cut its U.S. trade surplus, allow U.S. companies greater access to its markets and roll back its high-technology industrial subsidy programs. 
""We are still talking with China on a number of issues ... Those talks will continue to go on. We want lower (trade) barriers across the board,"" Kudlow said.
Specifically, Kudlow said, the United States was seeking ""zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers, zero subsidies, stop the IP theft, stop the technology transfer, allow Americans to own their own companies.""

""Those have been our asks for many months and so far those asks have not been satisfied,"" he said. ""However, hope springs eternal.""

1614,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 05:38PM ET</span>",Trump expecting 'positive' letter from North Korea's Kim Jong Un soon,"By Steve Holland
ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday a letter from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which he believes will be positive, is on its way to him, a day after expressing fresh optimism about a denuclearization deal.
""I know that a letter is being delivered to me, a personal letter from Kim Jong Un to me. It was handed at the border ... yesterday,"" Trump told reporters on Air Force One. ""It's being delivered. It's actually an elegant way... and I think it's going to be a positive letter.""
The two leaders have traded correspondence as they negotiate over North Korea's nuclear program and Trump has also praised Kim on social media. On Thursday, Trump thanked Kim on Twitter for expressing ""unwavering faith in President Trump"" and added: ""We will get it done together!"" 
Trump's latest remarks came after South Korean officials said after meeting Kim in Pyongyang this week that the North Korean leader had given his first timeline for denuclearization, in spite of widespread skepticism about his willingness to give up a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States.
According to the South Korean officials, Kim said his faith in Trump was ""unchanged"" and he wanted denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and an end to hostile relations with the United States before Trump's first term ends in early 2021.
However, there has been no indication that Kim has offered more concrete steps toward giving up his nuclear weapons and some U.S. officials privately doubt he is willing to abandon the arsenal.
Both Kim and Trump have stressed their personal relationship since meeting in an unprecedented June 12 summit which skeptics say was big on fanfare but short on substance.
Under discussion since has been whether North Korean denuclearization or declaring an end to the Korean War should come first. The 1950-53 war ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, meaning U.S.-led U.N. forces are technically still at war with the North.
Earlier on Friday, generals from the United States and North Korea met at the Korean border to discuss the recovery of the remains of U.S. service members killed in the Korean War, a senior U.S. official said.
The talks between U.S. Major General Michael Minihan, the chief of staff for the United Nations Command (UNC) and U.S. Forces Korea, and North Korean Lieutenant General An Ik-san followed North Korea's handover of remains in July under an agreement reached by Trump and Kim at the summit.
""While these talks are military-to-military and scheduled to be confined to the repatriation issue, having some progress on any front would be welcome,"" the U.S. official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ""That doesn’t mean there’s much optimism about moving forward on the political front.""
The official said that there remained concerns that Kim's improved relationship with China and his planned summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in this month could encourage him in resisting U.S. demands.
In previous, failed rounds of negotiations over North Korea's nuclear program, North Korea has said it could consider giving up its arsenal if Washington provides security guarantees by removing troops from South Korea and withdrawing its so-called nuclear umbrella of deterrence from the South and Japan.
The United States has 28,500 troops in South Korea and Trump has said in the past it should consider reducing the number unless Seoul shoulders more of the cost. 
South Korea has said American forces should stay even if a peace agreement is signed, while U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis assured Seoul in a June visit of an “ironclad” U.S. commitment to its security, including keeping U.S. troop levels unaltered.
On Friday, North Korea's official KCNA news agency quoted a statement from the obscure Anti-Imperialist National Democratic Front (AINDF) denouncing the presence of U.S. forces in South Korea and calling them the ""chieftain of aggression and division, and root cause of misfortune and pain.""

""The withdrawal of the U.S. forces, the end of the U.S. military presence and domination is the demand of the Korean nation and the irresistible trend of the times,"" it said.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, asked by conservative host Hugh Hewitt in an MSNBC interview if he had any doubts about Kavanaugh's confirmation, replied: ""None whatsoever.""
McConnell predicted that Kavanaugh, the conservative federal appeals court judge picked by Trump for a lifetime job on the top U.S. judicial body, would be on the Supreme Court when it opens its new term on Oct. 1. 
Trump's fellow Republicans control the Senate by a narrow margin. With no sign of any Republicans planning to vote against Kavanaugh, he seemed poised to win confirmation despite Democratic opposition.
""I think he made a very compelling case that he is one of the most qualified nominees, if not the most qualified, that we've seen for the Supreme Court of the United States, and I think I've seen 15 of them,"" said Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, who oversaw the hearing and has served in the Senate since 1981.
Kavanaugh completed two days of lengthy questioning by senators on Thursday night, keeping his composure under intense questioning by Democrats. Kavanaugh is likely to push the conservative-leaning court further to the right, if confirmed. 
The hearing ended on Friday after the committee heard from outside witnesses testifying for and against the nomination, with anti-Kavanaugh protesters again interrupting the proceedings.
Among those testifying were two representatives of the American Bar Association, the leading U.S. professional group for lawyers, who said a panel that rates judicial nominees gave Kavanaugh a ""well qualified"" rating, the highest possible.
Trump picked Kavanaugh, 53, to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement in June. After the committee votes on the nomination in the coming weeks, a final Senate vote is expected later in the month. 
GENIAL DEMEANOR
During his grueling testimony, Kavanaugh maintained a genial demeanor, blunting some of the most aggressive questioning from Democrats seeking to unsettle him. He trod a careful line when it came to Trump. He refused to be drawn into political controversies and avoided comment on matters such as whether a president can pardon himself or must respond to a subpoena or whether he would recuse himself from cases involving Trump.
Democratic senators expressed concern about what they saw as Kavanaugh's expansive view of president powers.
John Dean, the former White House counsel who was a key figure in the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard Nixon's 1974 resignation, told the committee Kavanaugh's past writings and remarks indicate his confirmation would create ""the most pro-presidential powers Supreme Court in the modern era.""
On divisive issues that could reach the court such as abortion and gun rights, Kavanaugh declined to offer personal views, restricting himself to reciting Supreme Court precedent.
Kavanaugh signaled respect for the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion nationwide, calling it an important legal precedent that had been reaffirmed by the justices over the decades.
Democrats painted Kavanaugh as a threat to abortion rights. Under questioning by Democratic Senator Kamala Harris, New York University School of Law professor Melissa Murray said that even if he does not back overturning Roe, if Kavanaugh joins fellow conservatives on the high court in upholding a succession of restrictive state laws it could mean ""death by a thousand cuts"" to a woman's right to an abortion.
In refusing to engage on Trump, Kavanaugh declined even to condemn the president's persistent criticism of the federal judiciary.

The president's first appointee to the high court, Neil Gorsuch, last year told senators Trump's remarks on the judiciary were ""disheartening"" and ""demoralizing."" The Washington Post reported in December that Gorsuch's comments had angered Trump and that he had privately considered yanking the nomination.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The presidents of Serbia and Kosovo abruptly called off a face-to-face meeting in Brussels on Friday, deflating hopes of a deal involving a land swap that could allow both nations to move toward EU membership.
Kosovo's President Hashim Thaci was due to discuss the swap plan with his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic for the first time in talks brokered by the EU's top diplomat Federica Mogherini. 
But both men refused to speak to each other moments before their meeting was due to start at the EU's headquarters in Brussels, diplomats said, leaving Mogherini to meet them separately several times during the day to keep talks alive.
""It went wrong today, they did not meet, they indulged in some drama instead,"" said one EU diplomat briefed on the talks, although it was not immediately clear what caused the breakdown.
""Difficulties remain,"" Mogherini said in a statement, although she said she would seek another meeting with the two presidents later this month. 
In an address to the nation on Friday evening, Serbia's Vucic said he would visit Kosovo this weekend as planned. On Sunday he is due to hold a rally in the northern Kosovan city of Mitrovica, which is mostly populated by Serbs.  
The failure to meet in person partly reflects a backlash in both Kosovo and Serbia to the land swap plan, as well as some resistance in Germany, the EU diplomat said. 
Belgrade and Pristina have both raised the idea of redrawing their border.
EU, U.S. SUPPORT
Kosovo, which has a population of 1.8 million is mainly ethnic Albanian, declared independence from Belgrade in 2008, almost a decade after NATO air strikes ousted Serbian forces and halted a crackdown on ethnic Albanians during a counter-insurgency.
It is now recognized by more than 100 nations but not by Serbia, Russia and five EU states. 
Politicians and analysts in Belgrade say that an agreement allowing Serbia to maintain control over northern Kosovo, in exchange for the Presevo Valley, an ethnic Albanian-populated area in Serbia's south, could be acceptable to both sides. 
But Germany warned last week that redrawing Serbia's border with Kosovo would fan ethnic tensions, although the European Union and the United States have said they would abide by a deal if it respected international law.
Kosovo's Thaci had told Reuters on Aug. 14 that he would present his plan to Serbia's Vucic at their meeting in Brussels.

Normalizing bilateral relations is a key condition for both Serbia and Kosovo to advance toward their eventual goal of EU membership. The Balkan neighbors agreed in 2013 to resolve all pending issues but have so far made little progress.

1617,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>","Study questions Iran-al Qaeda ties, despite U.S. allegations","By Warren Strobel
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - There is no evidence that Iran and al Qaeda cooperated in carrying out terrorist attacks, according to a study published on Friday that casts doubt on Trump administration statements about close ties between the two.
The conclusions of the study, by the New America think tank, were based on detailed analysis of documents seized in Osama bin Laden's hideout after U.S. forces killed the al Qaeda leader in 2011.
The findings clash with recent statements by U.S. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo suggesting Iran has collaborated with al Qaeda, which carried out the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the United States.
Debate has swirled over the relationship between Iran, a majority Shi'ite Muslim state, and radical Sunni group al Qaeda since late 2001, when some al Qaeda members fled to Iran after the United States toppled the Taliban government that had sheltered them in Afghanistan.
The bin Laden files, including a 19-page document not released until last November, show that Iran was uncomfortable with the militants' presence on its soil, said Nelly Lahoud, the study's author and an expert on al Qaeda.
At first, Lahoud said, Iran tried to move as many as possible to third countries.
Later, it detained al Qaeda members, including members of bin Laden's family, after they violated the terms of their stay, which included a ban on phone communications, the study says.
The militant group also viewed Tehran with deep mistrust, the study shows. 
Iran's policies tightened even further after the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, and detained al Qaeda members were forbidden from leaving the country, it says.
""Iranian authorities decided to keep our brothers as a bargaining chip,"" the unnamed al Qaeda operative wrote in the document, which was dated January 2007.
Lahoud, who has studied the bin Laden documents since the first batch was released in 2012, said she looked for evidence that al Qaeda and Iran had operational ties in plotting terror attacks.
""This I did not find,"" she said.
Both Trump and Pompeo have suggested a closer relationship, as part of an anti-Tehran communications offensive by the U.S. government.
In announcing the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, Trump said in May that Iran ""supports terrorist proxies and militias such as...al Qaeda.""
In a speech a week later, Pompeo said: ""Today we ask the Iranian people: Is this what you want your country to be known for, for being a co-conspirator with Hezbollah, Hamas, the Taliban, and al Qaeda.""
A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Iran has refused to bring top al Qaeda members residing in Iran to justice, or even publicly identify who they are.
Iran also has allowed al Qaeda ""to operate a core facilitation pipeline through Iran since at least 2009, enabling AQ to move funds and fighters to South Asia and Syria,"" the official said.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Reuters) - A Dallas police officer will be charged with manslaughter after mistakenly entering an apartment she thought was hers and fatally shooting the man who lived there, authorities said on Friday.
The officer had completed a shift late on Thursday and was still in uniform when she returned to what she believed was her home and encountered 26-year-old Botham Shem Jean, Dallas police chief U. Renee Hall said at a news conference.
""It's not clear what (the) interaction was between her and the victim,"" Hall said. ""But at some point, she fired her weapon, striking the victim. She called 911.""
""Right now, there are more questions than we have answers,"" the chief said. ""We understand the concern of this community.""
The officer is white, while her victim was a black man whose family is from the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia, Hall said.
The St. Lucia Times reported that Jean was the son of a former permanent secretary for two governmental ministries of St. Lucia and he had been employed by PricewaterhouseCoopers and lived in a gated community. PricewaterhouseCoopers spokeswoman Megan DiSciullo told Reuters that Jean had worked in the company's Dallas office for two years. 
Citing a relative of Jean, the newspaper reported that the officer lived on another floor of the same complex.
Hall said the Texas Rangers would take over the investigation because of the ""unique"" nature of the incident. Hall said the officer would be publicly identified after she was officially charged.
The chief said blood was drawn from the officer to test for alcohol or drugs in her system.
She said emergency responders had arrived within four minutes of being called, and Jean was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.

1619,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 03:53PM ET</span>",Brazil presidential election thrown into chaos after front-runner stabbed,"By Brad Brooks and Gabriel Stargardter
SAO PAULO/JUIZ DE FORA, Brazil (Reuters) - Brazil's presidential race was thrown into chaos on Friday with the far-right front-runner Jair Bolsonaro in serious but stable condition in an intensive care unit after being stabbed at a rally one month before the vote.
Bolsonaro, a congressman, was knifed in the stomach while being carried atop supporters' shoulders in a street rally on Thursday and was being treated at a Sao Paulo hospital. A Tweet posted on Bolsonaro's verified account said he was ""doing well and recuperating.""
The attack further clouds Brazil's most unpredictable election in three decades. Corruption investigations have jailed scores of powerful businessmen and politicians in recent years, and alienated infuriated voters. 
Bolsonaro, 63, has for years angered many Brazilians with extreme statements, but is also seen by his many supporters as a politically incorrect gust of fresh air in a rotten system.
He has repeatedly said the country's notoriously violent police should increase their killing of suspected drug gang members and armed criminals. That plays well with wealthier voters, but is terrifying for the 50 percent of Brazilians who said in a 2017 Datafolha poll they feared being victims of police violence. 
Surveys consistently give Bolsonaro around 22 percent in simulated first-round votes. However, those polls find he would badly lose to most rivals in the likely event of a runoff, which takes place if no candidate wins a majority in the first ballot.
ELECTION BOOST?
Some Bolsonaro backers and analysts, especially in financial markets, forecast the attack could give Bolsonaro a huge boost. They argue it will draw in some of the 28 percent of voters who say they are undecided or will not vote for anyone. 
""I just want to send a message to the thugs who tried to ruin the life of a family man, a guy who is the hope for millions of Brazilians: You just elected him president. He will win in the first round,"" Flavio Bolsonaro, the candidate's son, said on Friday, echoing sentiment many spread across social media. 
Carlos Melo, a political scientist with Insper, a Sao Paulo business school, said Bolsonaro may gain some votes. But he doubted there would be a big shift his way, especially given that 44 percent of those surveyed in the latest Ibope poll say they would never cast a ballot for Bolsonaro, the stiffest rejection for any candidate.
""I see no reason why voters who have previously said they reject him would now automatically support him,"" Melo said. 
The political scientist thinks that once the commotion of the attack passes, voters may soberly think about the roots of the political polarization and aggressive rhetoric that has engulfed Brazil. 
""Jair Bolsonaro is a symbol of that process,"" Melo said. ""Voters may be awakened to the thought that politicians who propose loosening gun laws, for example, end up giving unbridled power to crazy people, like the man who carried out the attack yesterday."" 
LITTLE TIME
Bolsonaro was stabbed while being carried on someone's
shoulders in a crowd of cheering supporters in the city of Juiz de Fora.
TV pictures showed him screaming in pain, then falling
backward into the arms of those around him. 
Police video taken at a precinct showed suspect Adelio Bispo de Oliveira telling police he had been ordered by God to carry out the attack.
Speaking earlier in an online video from hospital in Juiz de Fora, Bolsonaro said the pain of the attack at first was like being hit by a soccer ball.
""It was intolerable and it seemed like maybe something worse was happening,"" he said, talking in a weak, raspy voice with a tube in his nose and monitors beeping nearby. ""I was preparing for this sort of thing. You run risks."" 
Bolsonaro was stabilized and in the intensive care unit at the Einstein hospital in Sao Paulo on Friday. 
Dr. Luiz Henrique Borsato, who operated on the candidate, said the internal wounds were ""grave"" and ""put the patient's life at risk"" but that he was stable. Doctors were worried about an infection since Bolsonaro's intestines were perforated.
Bolsonaro likely needs to spend at least a week in the hospital and would be unable to campaign for at least three weeks - or just before the Oct. 7 first-round vote.
That could seriously damage his run. 
Bolsonaro's tiny coalition has almost no campaign time on government-regulated candidate commercial blocs on television and radio. He must rely on social media and raucous rallies around the country to drum up support, events he is now unlikely to attend for some weeks. 
Running as the law-and-order candidate, Bolsonaro has positioned himself as the anti-politician, though he has spent nearly three decades in Congress.
He has long espoused taking a radical stance on public security in Brazil, which has more homicides than any other country, according to U.N. statistics, and has openly praised Brazil's military dictatorship, which he has said should have killed more people. 
Bolsonaro faces trial before the Supreme Court for speech that prosecutors said incited hate and rape. He has called the charges politically motivated. 
His stabbing is the latest instance of political violence, which is particularly rampant at the local level. Earlier this year, Marielle Franco, a Rio city councilwoman who was an outspoken critic of police violence against slum residents, was assassinated. 
One supporter camped outside Bolsonaro's hospital room, Bruno Engler, 21, who is running for a Minas Gerais state congressional seat on Bolsonaro's Social Liberal Party, said if he could, he would lynch the suspect.

""They call us on the right the intolerant, the violent ones, but those who are intolerant and violent are them,"" Engler said, referring to leftist voters.

The Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) tribunal, founded under a 2016 peace deal between the government and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels, will try cases considered representative of the war's violence and mete out sentences to ex-guerrillas, paramilitaries and government soldiers convicted of war crimes and human rights violations.
Some tribunal staff have hidden that former rebel commanders are not following the terms of the accord, attorney general Nestor Humberto Martinez said.
""The attorney general's office has evidence that some unscrupulous officials are cooking up falsehoods and procedural fraud so the Special Jurisdiction for Peace won't act as it should,"" Martinez said. ""For that reason we have opened an investigation by a special prosecutor that will produce decisions shortly.""
Martinez did not name the officials or the ex-commanders they are alleged to have helped, but his comments came one day after the U.N. Verification Mission in Colombia, which manages two dozen rebel reintegration zones, said six ex-guerrilla commanders were failing to fulfill their obligations under the deal and had left the camps.
The six missing commanders include Hernan Dario Velasquez, known as by his nom de guerre El Paisa, and Henry Castellanos, known as Romana, a source who works at an organization that closely follows the peace process said.
Velasquez was convicted in absentia for ordering a 2003 Bogota bombing that killed 36 people. Castellanos was allegedly involved in drug trafficking and well-known kidnappings.
The other commanders' noms de guerre are Ivan Ali, Albeiro Cordoba, Enrique Marulanda and El Zarco Aldinever, the source said.
""If the Attorney General has detected there are people who were part of the demobilization, disarmament and reintegration process who continued criminal activities, he should proceed with the investigations,"" President Ivan Duque, who was elected on promises to modify the FARC deal, said after an event with the country's provincial governors.
Most of the more than 6,000 former FARC fighters who demobilized last year were given amnesty and financial help, but many commanders are expected to appear before the tribunal.
The JEP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

COLOMBO/MALE (Reuters) - Maldives accused the United States of intimidation on Friday, a day after Washington called for the release of ""falsely accused"" political prisoners and threatened action if the island's upcoming election is not free and fair. 
Maldives is due to hold a presidential election on Sept. 23 when incumbent Abdulla Yameen will seek a second five-year term.
Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman at the U.S. State Department, said in a statement released on Thursday that the United States was concerned about continued ""democratic backsliding in Maldives"" ahead of the vote.
""We join the international community in calling for the release of falsely accused political prisoners; full implementation of the Maldivian Supreme Court's February ruling overturning the convictions of opposition members; an end to executive interference in the Parliament and judiciary ..."" Nauert said.
""Absent Maldives' return to a democratic path, the United States will consider appropriate measures against those individuals who undermine democracy, the rule of law, and a free and fair electoral process,"" she said.
The Maldives' foreign ministry said on Friday that the United States' call for the release of 'falsely accused political prisoners' was seen as ""an act of intimidation"" and imposing undue influence on the democratic processes of a sovereign state before a key poll.
It urged the United States to allow the Maldivians to freely decide who should lead them on Sept. 23 for the next five years.
""It should be noted that the Maldives has no political prisoners, and all those who have been convicted have undergone due process,"" it said in a statement.
The Indian Ocean tourist island has been beset by political instability since a police mutiny forced its first democratically elected leader, Mohamed Nasheed, to quit in 2012.
President Yameen imposed a state of emergency earlier this year, since lifted, to annul a Feb. 1 Supreme Court ruling that quashed convictions against nine opposition leaders and that ordered his government to free those held in prison. 
His government has rejected repeated requests by the United Nations, rights groups, and the West to release the president's rivals and follow fair legal procedures. 
The European Union in July warned of possible sanctions ranging from travel bans to asset freezes against those in the Maldives responsible for human rights violations and undermining the rule of law.
In the election, Yameen will be challenged by veteran lawmaker Ibrahim ""Ibu"" Mohamed Solih representing the opposition Democratic Party after former president Nasheed, who now lives in exile in Sri Lanka, withdrew as a candidate after the national election commission ruled him ineligible to run.

The six were part of a group of fighters from the Kurdish opposition group PJAK who had attacked the facility on the border with Iraq on July 20, killing 10 Guards, the elite Revolutionary Guards said in a statement carried by IRNA.
The Party of Free Life of Kurdistan (PJAK) - an outlawed group that seeks self-governance for Iran's Kurds and has links to Turkey's militant Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) - operates in the border area, along with other armed Kurdish groups based in northern Iraq.
Despite sporadic clashes with the militants, there is little coordination between Iranian and Iraqi forces over security of the remote mountainous border that has also been used by Islamic State to enter Iran.
In June 2017, Islamic State militants carried out coordinated attacks at the parliament building in Tehran and the mausoleum of Iranian revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini south of the capital, killing at least 18 people.

1623,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 02:52PM ET</span>","Russia, Turkey, Iran fail to agree on ceasefire for Syria's Idlib","By Denis Pinchuk
TEHRAN (Reuters) - The presidents of Turkey, Iran and Russia on Friday failed to agree on a ceasefire that would forestall a Syrian government offensive in rebel-held Idlib province which the United Nations fears could cause a humanitarian catastrophe involving tens of thousands of civilians. 
Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan, Russia's Vladimir Putin and Iran's Hassan Rouhani, meeting in Tehran for a summit of key foreign players in Syria's war, agreed in a final statement that there could be no military solution to the conflict and it could only end through a negotiated political process.
But as Syrian government and Russian warplanes mounted air strikes in Idlib on Friday morning in a possible prelude to a full-scale offensive, Putin and Rouhani pushed back against Erdogan's call for a truce.
The Turkish leader said he feared a massacre and Turkey could not accommodate any more refugees flooding over its border.
Putin said a ceasefire would be pointless as it would not involve Islamist militant groups it deems terrorists. Rouhani said Syria must regain control over all its territory.
Idlib is the insurgents' only remaining major stronghold and a government offensive could be the war's last decisive battle.
Tehran and Moscow have helped Assad turn the course of the war against an array of opponents ranging from Western-backed rebels to the Islamist militants, while Turkey is a leading opposition supporter and has troops in the country.
Their discussions in Tehran mark a crucial point in a seven-year-old war which has killed more than half a million people and forced 11 million to flee their homes.
Erdogan, in his opening remarks, said a ceasefire in Idlib would be a victory for their summit. 
Putin responded: ""The fact is that there are no representatives of the armed opposition here around this table. And more still, there are no representatives of Jabhat al-Nusra or ISIS or the Syrian army."".
""I think in general the Turkish president is right. It would be good. But I can't speak for them, and even more so can't talk for terrorists from Jabhat al-Nusra or ISIS that they will stop shooting or stop using drones with bombs.""
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a meeting with Putin on Friday that Iran and Russia can work together to restrain America and that Syria is a good example of how American can be restrained, according his official website.
""One of the issues that the two sides can cooperate on is restraining America,"" Khamenei said. ""Because America is a danger for humanity and there is a possibility to restrain them.""
""The Americans have faced a real defeat in Syria and have not reached their goals,"" he added.
In the final statement, the three agreed on the need to eliminate Islamic State, the Nusra Front, and other groups linked to al Qaeda and designated as terrorists. But there were other armed opposition groups who could join any ceasefire agreement, they said.
The communique also called on the United Nations and the international community to step up humanitarian aid to Syria and help in restoring basic infrastructure assets. 
Efforts must be made to protect and to create conditions for the safe return of refugees, it added. 
""HORRIFIC, BLOODY BATTLE""
Iran's Rouhani said the battle in Syria would continue until rebels were pushed out of the whole country, especially in Idlib, but he added that any military operations should avoid hurting civilians.
He called on all rebels in Syria to disarm and seek a peaceful end to the conflict.
""The fight against terrorism in Idlib is an indispensable part of the mission to return peace and stability to Syria, but this fight should not harm civilians and lead to a ""scorched-earth"" policy,"" Rouhani said.
Erdogan said Turkey no longer had the capacity to take in any more refugees from Syria should the government offensive in Idlib go ahead. Turkey has accepted 3.5 million refugees from Syria since the start of the war in 2011.
""Whatever reason there is an attack that has been made or will be made will result in disaster, massacre and humanitarian drama,"" he said. ""Millions will be coming to Turkey's borders because they have nowhere to go. Turkey has filled its capacity to host refugees.""
The Assad government was not directly represented at the summit, nor were the United States and other Western powers.
The United States came in for criticism from all sides, however, highlighting to complex nature of a conflict involving a myriad of factions.
Rouhani said the United States should end its presence in Syria, while Erdogan said Turkey was ""extremely annoyed"" by Washington's support for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, whom Ankara considers as terrorists linked to Kurdish separatists in Turkey.
Widely abhorred internationality for the brutal conduct of the war, Assad has largely reclaimed most of Syrian territory though much of it is ravaged. Although the West has long said he must stand down or be removed, that looks unlikely at this point.
Meanwhile, the fate of Idlib hung in the balance.
The United Nations Security Council met to discuss Idlib on Friday at the request of the United States, and U.N. Syria mediator Staffan de Mistura said there were ""all the ingredients for a perfect storm"".
""The dangers are profound that any battle for Idlib could be, would be a horrific and bloody battle,"" de Mistura said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's domestic spy chief expressed scepticism on Friday that migrants had been hounded in Chemnitz after the fatal stabbing of a German man, undermining Chancellor Angela Merkel who has said images from the eastern city ""very clearly"" showed hate.
Germany has been deeply shaken by the most violent right-wing protests in decades after the Aug. 26 killing of the German man in Chemnitz, in the state of Saxony, for which two immigrants were arrested.
Friday's comments by Hans-Georg Maassen, head of the BfV domestic intelligence agency, aggravated tensions about whether politicians and the authorities are being too complacent in the face of rising xenophobia in Germany, where many had thought the lessons of Nazi history had long been learned.
Michael Kretschmer, Saxony's conservative state premier, said on Wednesday migrants had not been hounded, but Merkel rebuffed his remark, saying pictures had shown ""hate and ... the persecution of innocent people"".
Maassen told Bild newspaper: ""I share the scepticism about media reports on right-wing extremists hunting down people in Chemnitz,"" adding that a video circulating showing that happening could have been faked.
As officials and politicians traded barbs, hundreds of far-right protesters and counter-protesters gathered in Chemnitz for another evening of the demonstrations that have taken place almost nightly in the city.
Senior Social Democrat Thomas Oppermann accusing Maassen of ""sewing confusion"" about events in Chemnitz, known as Karl-Marx-Stadt when it was part of former Communist East Germany.
Katrin Goering-Eckardt, leader of the opposition Greens in parliament, said Maassen's decision to focus on the video rather than on some protesters performing the illegal Hitler salute in Chemnitz showed he was no longer fit for his job.
""Two crucial posts for the security of the free, democratic basis of our country are, with him (Maassen) and his supervisor (Interior Minister) Horst Seehofer, clearly in the wrong hands,"" Goering-Eckardt added in a statement.
MIGRATION
But Seehofer told a news conference he had no reason to doubt Maassen's assessment, adding it was important that security authorities knew politicians backed their work.
Rolland Woeller, Saxony's interior minister also supported Maassen, telling broadcaster MDR: ""The chief public prosecutor in Saxony also has no knowledge of witch hunts.""
On Thursday, Merkel appeared at odds with Seehofer, who said: ""Migration is the mother of all problems."" She later responded, saying: ""I say it differently. Migration presents us with challenges and here we have problems but also successes.""
Merkel's spokesman, asked about her trust in Maassen, responded: ""Mr Maassen has an important and responsible role.""
Merkel, who has said images from Chemnitz ""very clearly"" showed hate, on Thursday accused the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party of using violent protests over the stabbing to stir up ethnic tension.
Adding to concerns about the influence of the far-right in parts of the former East Germany, newspaper Die Welt reported on Friday that authorities were investigating reports of an attack in late August on a Jewish restaurant in Chemnitz by around a dozen neo-Nazis shouting ""Jewish pigs"" and throwing stones.

""If the reports are true, then we are dealing with a new quality of anti-Semitic crimes,"" the paper quoted the government's anti-Semitism rapporteur Felix Klein as saying.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A former Chilean bishop staunchly defended by Pope Francis after being accused of helping to conceal sexual abuse has been named a suspect in two criminal investigations into alleged cover-ups, a prosecutor and another legal source said on Friday. 
Juan Barros, whose resignation as bishop of Osorno was accepted by the Pope in June alongside those of four other bishops, was interrogated as a suspect for more than three hours on Thursday in Santiago, city prosecutor Raul Guzman said. 
Separately, prosecutor Emiliano Arias has named Barros as a suspect in the cover-up of several sex abuse cases in Rancagua, a city just south of the Chilean capital, the legal source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Barros is due to be questioned over the cases shortly, the source said. The cases have not yet been identified. 
Barros was accused of protecting Reverend Fernando Karadima, his former mentor who was found guilty by a Vatican investigation in 2011 of abusing teenage boys over many years. Barros has maintained he was unaware of any wrongdoing.
In January, the pope was forced to apologize after dismissing allegations against Barros as ""slander"" and ""without evidence"" during a visit to Chile. 
Barros told journalists after being questioned by the Santiago police's Sexual Crimes Unit on Thursday that he was a suspect in the cover-up of the case of Father Pedro Quiroz, a former military chaplain who fell under his direction when he was the country's military bishop between 2004 and 2015.
""I contributed what I could contribute. I told the prosecutor what I knew or didn't know,"" Barros said. 
Speaking to journalists after the interrogation, Guzman confirmed that Barros was a suspect in the Quiroz case. 
According to a statement posted on the military bishopric's website, a complaint of abuse in 1997 was filed against Quiroz in July 2018. The priest was previously investigated by the Vatican over abuse allegations in 2000, but the case was shelved for lack of statements from the alleged victims, the statement said. 
The office of the bishop to the armed services in August became the latest in a series of Church facilities raided by Chilean prosecutors who have launched one of the world's most aggressive investigations into the abuse scandal. 

Arias, the prosecutor, seized documents related to complaints made over 20 years to Santiago Silva, the current military bishop, and his predecessor, Barros, of clerical sexual abuse inside and outside the armed forces.

Autostrade, part of infrastructure group Atlantia, operated the 50-year-old bridge and its involvement in the rebuilding could soothe public anger at the toll-road group.
Famed architect Renzo Piano has offered to donate project designs for a new viaduct in his hometown.
""This new bridge will have to last a thousand years. It will be made in steel and it should be simple, frugal but not banal,"" Piano said after attending a meeting with the CEOs of the two companies and local politicians.
""We have asked Autostrade to cooperate with Fincantieri, which is part of the local community, on demolishing and rebuilding the bridge,"" Liguria region governor Giovanni Toti said at the end of Friday's meeting.
""We want to drive our cars on the new bridge from October 2019,"" Genoa major Marco Bucci said.
The deadly bridge collapse sparked public outrage in Italy. Rome's anti-establishment government has piled blame on Autostrade, which runs the A10 motorway that links Genoa to the French border.
Autostrade's top executives, including CEO Giovanni Castellucci, are among 20 people being investigated for alleged manslaughter after the disaster.
Autostrade and its sister engineering company Spea are also under investigation. Under Italian law, companies are also held responsible for their employees' actions.
""We feel responsible for managing an infrastructure that collapsed, causing a huge disaster and pain ... but being guilty requires awareness of the causes, which will have to be ascertained,"" Castellucci told Italian daily La Stampa.
Several Transport Ministry officials are also being probed. 
The government has promised to revoke the entire motorway concessions operated in Italy by Autostrade, which is controlled by the Benetton family, saying the company reaped extra profits from the motorway business.
""We have started a huge work on concessions ... we will review them one-by-one,"" Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said in an interview published in Corriere della Sera.
""Autostrade is only the tip of the iceberg ... there are also water, telecommunications and television,"" he said without elaborating.

Protesters rolled burning tires and hurled stones toward the Israeli soldiers and the border fence, witnesses said. The Israeli military said that some threw firebombs and a grenade. No Israelis were hurt.
Reuters television footage showed incendiary kites in the air being sent toward Israel.
Palestinian health officials said a 17-year-old boy was shot dead by Israeli soldiers and that 210 others were wounded, 45 of them with live fire, including a medic.
An Israeli military statement said soldiers had used riot dispersal means and acted ""in accordance with standard operating procedures."" Israeli aircraft also struck two Hamas outposts, the military said.
Since Gazans began holding weekly border protests began on March 30, the Israeli army has killed 173 Palestinians and wounded thousands. A Gaza sniper has killed an Israeli soldier.
Gaza, a narrow coastal enclave home to more than 2 million Palestinians is controlled by Islamist group Hamas. Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintains tight control of its land and sea borders. Egypt also restricts movement in and out of Gaza on its border. 
The protests are taking place at a time of growing frustration over the prospects for an independent Palestinian state. Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been stalled for several years and Israeli settlements in the occupied territories have expanded.
Israel says Hamas deliberately provokes violence at the protests, a charge Hamas denies.

Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested last month that NATO forces in eastern Europe posed a threat to Russia, a charge firmly rejected by NATO officials.
    The U.S. Army's European headquarters in Wiesbaden, Germany, said the new forces would be permanently stationed in Germany as ""a display of our continued commitment to NATO and our collective resolve to support European security.""
    Sharp criticism of the NATO alliance by U.S. President Donald Trump had triggered fears that Washington could reduce defense spending in Europe and reduce its presence.
    ""The addition of these forces increases U.S Army readiness in Europe and ensures we are better able to respond to any crisis,"" it said. The increased troop levels will still be far below those seen during the Cold War.
    The troop increase was mandated by 2017 U.S. legislation that called for an increase in U.S. Army troop levels, with a significant portion of the increase to come in Europe.
    The U.S. Army said it would begin activating new units at several bases in Germany this year, including a field artillery brigade headquarters, two multiple launch rocket system battalions, and a short-range air defense battalion.
    Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador in Germany, said the decision underscored Washington's commitment to strengthening he transatlantic alliance, while planned military spending increases had improved security.
    German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen, a conservative who is battling the Social Democrat coalition partners to back a boost in German military spending, welcomed the decision.

    ""The U.S. decision to increase the military presence here in Germany is a welcome sign of the vitality of transatlantic relationship and a commitment to our joint security,"" she said.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's military on Friday unveiled a directive governing the use of cannabis by its troops as the country prepares for the drug's legalization in October. 
The directive takes effect on Oct. 17, when pot becomes legal. It prohibits members of Canada's armed forces from consuming cannabis eight hours before any duty, 24 hours before any operation of weapons or vehicles and 28 days before high altitude parachuting, operating in a hyperbaric environment and serving on a military aircraft. 
Cannabis consumption is also prohibited on international operations, according to the directive, which was provided by the military to Reuters.
Canada, a pioneer in approving medical marijuana, is set to become the first OECD country to legalize its recreational use. The pending legalization has sent governments and law enforcement scrambling to set up frameworks governing its use and policing misuse.

It is unclear whether the regulated legal marketplace will be able to meet demand and displace the thriving illegal market.

BASRA/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Protesters stormed the Iranian consulate in Iraq's southern city of Basra on Friday, turning their wrath on Iraq's powerful neighbor after five days of deadly demonstrations in which government buildings have been ransacked and torched.
Demonstrators broke in and began damaging the offices, shouting condemnation of what many Iraqis perceive as Iran's sway over Iraq's political parties. Security sources said the consulate was empty when the crowd burst in.
The storming came hours after Iraq's most revered Shi'ite cleric called for a political shakeup in Baghdad and a halt to violence against the protesters.
Ayatollah Ali Sistani, the ultimate authority for devout members of Iraq's Shi'ite majority, placed blame for the unrest with political leaders and said a new government should be formed, ""different from its predecessors"".
At least 10 protesters have died, mostly in clashes with the security forces, since Monday in Basra, a city of 2 million people. Residents say they have been driven to the streets by corruption and misrule that allowed infrastructure to collapse, leaving no power or safe drinking water in the heat of summer.
The unrest could have deeper implications for a country that imports most of its food. Since Thursday protesters have shut Iraq's only major sea port at Umm Qasr, 60 km (40 miles) south of Basra. It remained shut on Friday, local officials and security sources said, although oil exports, carried out from offshore platforms, have not been affected.
Smaller protests in solidarity with Basra took place in several other cities including Karbala and Baghdad.
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi's national security council met on Friday and said it was investigating casualties at the protests. Abadi, under pressure to promise more money to fix Basra's public services, said funds that had previously been allocated would be released.
More than 2,000 people, including many women, gathered in Basra on Friday afternoon, to mourn a protester who died from burns during the torching of the provincial government headquarters overnight.
Mourners carried the body from his house through the streets to the singed government building, chanting: ""This is a promise, this is a promise, Basra won't stay silent anymore!"" Some fired live rounds into the air. Others carried broomsticks, to ""sweep clean"" corrupt officials. Protesters set fire to what remained of the government buildings torched the night before.
""FAILINGS OF LEADERS""
The unrest has thrust Iraq into a major new crisis at a time when politicians still have yet to agree a new government after an inconclusive election in May. The new parliament finally met on Monday for the first time, but broke up after a day with no faction assembling enough votes to elect a speaker, much less name the next prime minister.
Sistani, an 88-year-old cleric who normally holds himself above day-to-day politics, has been known to intervene in political affairs when he sees the country's future in danger.
In his Friday prayer sermon read out by an aide he demanded an end to the use of violence against ""peaceful protests"" and placed the blame firmly on politicians.
""The failings of Iraqi political leaders in recent years have caused the anger of people in Basra,"" Sistani said. ""This reality cannot change if the next government is formed according to the same criteria adopted when forming previous governments. Pressure must be exerted for the new government to be different from its predecessors.""
Parliament's interim leader summoned lawmakers to an emergency session on Saturday to discuss the unrest.
The past four years saw Iraq's political factions mainly come together during a war against Islamic State. Baghdad's two most influential allies, Washington and Tehran, also backed the government despite their deep hostility to each other.
But since Islamic State was largely defeated last year, divisions have resurfaced. Shi'ites in the south, where most of Iraq's oil wealth is produced, say Baghdad politicians have squandered state funds while leaving them desperate.
Moqtada al-Sadr, a populist Shi'ite cleric whose electoral bloc came first in May's election, said on Twitter that Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi must release more funds for Basra.
Sadr, the former leader of an anti-American Shi'ite sectarian militia who has reinvented himself as an anti-corruption campaigner, has allied himself with Abadi. 

Their alliance is competing to form a government against a rival bloc backed by Abadi's predecessor Nuri al-Maliki and the leader of an Iran-backed Shi'ite armed group, Hadi al-Amiri. Amiri called on Abadi to resign over the crisis on Friday.

A statement from the office of Myanmar's President Win Myint dismissed Thursday's ICC ruling as ""the result of faulty procedure and is of dubious legal merit"".
""Furthermore, allegations consisting of charged narratives of harrowing personal tragedies which have nothing to do with the legal arguments in question were permitted, thereby putting emotional pressure on the Court,"" the statement said, referring to submissions requested by the court. 
The decision from the Hague-based court opened the way for its prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, to further examine whether there is sufficient evidence to file charges against any Myanmar officials, although she has not done so yet.
An independent U.N. fact-finding mission in August concluded that Myanmar's military last year carried out mass killings and gang rapes of Muslim Rohingya with ""genocidal intent"" and the commander-in-chief and five generals should be prosecuted for orchestrating the gravest crimes under law.
About 700,000 Rohingya fled the crackdown, according to U.N. agencies, and most are now living in refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Although Myanmar is not a member of the Hague-based court, Bangladesh is, and the cross-border nature of deportation was sufficient for jurisdiction, the ICC said in Thursday's ruling.
Myanmar has denied allegations of atrocities made against its security forces by refugees, saying its military carried out justifiable actions against militants.

In Friday's statement, the Southeast Asian nation repeated its position that, not being a party to the Rome Statute that set up the ICC, it was under no obligation to respect its rulings.

In a speech outlining France's space policy for the coming years, Parly said the Russian satellite Louch-Olymp had approached the Athena-Fidus satellite in 2017. 
Parly said it came so close ""that anyone would have thought it was attempting to intercept our communications."" She added: ""Attempting to listen to your neighbors is not only unfriendly, it's an act of espionage.
The minister's remarks come a week after President Emmanuel Macron urged the European Union to modernize its post-Cold War ties with Moscow despite tensions with the West, including over allegations of meddling in foreign elections.
Built by Thales Alenia Space, the satellite provides secure communications to the French and Italian armed forces and emergency services.
Parly described the Russian efforts as a ""little Star Wars"" and said measures were taken immediately to prevent sensitive communications being compromised. The Louch-Olymp had since targeted other satellites, she added.
""We are in danger. Our communications, our military exercises, our daily lives are in danger if we do not react,"" Parly said, emphasizing that Paris would complete a strategic space defense plan by the end of the year. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration in August announced an ambitious plan to usher in a new ""Space Force"" as the sixth branch of the U.S. military by 2020.
It would be responsible for a range of space-based U.S. military capabilities, which include everything from satellites enabling the Global Positioning System (GPS) to sensors that help track missile launches.

""I have heard many people mock the announcement of the creation of an American Space Force. I am not one of them... all I see is an extremely powerful sign, a sign of future confrontations,"" Parly said.

The ruling Social Democrats and Greens, and their parliament ally the Left Party, were backed by 39.5 percent, according to Friday's poll by Novus for public service broadcaster SVT. 
The other of the two blocs that have defined Swedish politics for a decade, the four-party center-right Alliance coalition, trailed close behind on 38.5 percent.
The nationalist Sweden Democrats scored 19.1 percent, well above the 12.9 percent they won in the previous election in 2014. 
Those figures suggest political gridlock may be hard to avoid after Sunday's vote.
""I think we are facing an extremely complicated process to form a government, maybe the most complicated in modern times,"" said political scientist Niklas Bohlin at the Mid Sweden University. 
Either some form of cooperation between the centre-left and Alliance or an accommodation with the Sweden Democrats is likely to be necessary.
But the two blocs have never governed in tandem, and so far all other parties have shunned the Sweden Democrats.
While most pollsters see the two blocs winning roughly equal support, the figures for the Sweden Democrats differ widely between surveys. 
Ranging at about 16-19 percent in the traditional polls based on phone calls, the nationalists score as high as 25 percent in some online surveys, which have often been seen as at greater risk of being skewed.
But the traditional polls greatly underestimated support for the Sweden Democrats before the previous election, while the online surveys were far closer to the result.
""It's not that they are shy voters, but that they are distrustful of the polling agencies,"" said Henrik Ekengren Oscarsson, a professor in political science at Gothenburg University.
""So the Sweden Democrats' sympathizers are not participating in these kinds of surveys.""
Traditional pollsters have said they have altered their methods to better reflect the level of support for the Sweden Democrats.

FREDRIKSTAD, Norway (Reuters) - German troops and vehicles arrived in Norway on Friday for the largest exercise on NATO's northern flank since the Cold War - a sign that the alliance wants to sharpen its defenses against Russia after years of cuts and far-flung combat missions.
Russia said last week that it plans to hold its biggest war games since the fall of the Soviet Union next month, together with the Chinese and Mongolian armies. 
""The focus has changed in the last years because the security environment all over the world, but also in Europe, has changed,"" Norwegian Defence Minister Frank Bakke-Jensen told Reuters as he welcomed German troops at Fredrikstad port.
Watching the hulking Ark Germania vessel unload 240 vehicles and other equipment, he said NATO was increasingly worried about Russia, which in 2014 annexed Crimea from Ukraine.
""That's also why we're exercising the defense of Europe.""
Centered in Norway, the Trident Juncture exercise will bring together 40,000 troops from over 30 NATO countries and their partners, conducting air, sea and land operations from Finland and the Baltic Sea in the east to Iceland in the west.
""It's a test of the collective defense mechanisms in NATO, the Article 5 that states 'One for all, all for one', where the NATO countries will come to the aid of one if attacked,"" said Colonel Eystein Kvarving of Norway's Joint Headquarters.
Lieutenant Nikolaus Berghammer, leading a logistics company of 60 German soldiers, said a dozen more ships were due from Germany in the next few weeks, and 70 vessels overall.
Normally based in Delmenhorst in northern Germany, Berghammer and his team were among the first to arrive in Norway and will be around until December.
The exercises, in late October and early November, will test NATO's logistics and its ability to fight in the field. They will steer clear of Norway's northernmost county in the hope of avoiding any tensions on the Russian border.
A few weeks later, there will be computer-simulated warfare aimed at training command and control procedures.

The Russian exercise next month, called Vostok-2018 (East-2018), will take place in Russia's central and eastern military districts and involve almost 300,000 troops, more than 1,000 military aircraft, two of Russia's naval fleets and all of its airborne units.

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Friday appointed former banker Mthuli Ncube as finance minister and kept Winston Chitando in charge of mining, placing two technocrats at the helm of plans to rescue the country's battered economy.
The 75-year-old leader is under pressure to rebuild an economy hit by lack of foreign investment, unemployment above 80 percent and acute dollar shortages that have hobbled some imports.
Mnangagwa won a disputed vote on July 30, the first election in the southern African nation since Robert Mugabe was removed by the army last November after nearly four decades in power.
In appointing Ncube, Mnangagwa wants to show the international community that he is giving priority to the economy and moving away from the Mugabe years where important cabinet posts were given on patronage lines.
""It sounds very encouraging especially on the choice of finance minister. That's a very good foundation for the country’s economic recovery prospects,"" said John Robertson, a Harare-based independent economist. 
""I hope the president will permit those ministers to exercise their skills without interference.""
Ncube, 55, is a former chief economist and vice president at the African Development Bank (AfDB) and was also a lecturer in finance at the London School of Economics and Wits Business School in South Africa. 
He founded Zimbabwe's Barbican Bank and asset management company, which were, however, put into administration by the central bank in 2005 after only two years of operations. The bank's license was later canceled.
Ncube will be tasked with crafting an economic recovery program as well as coming up with strategy to pay off Zimbabwe's $1.8 billion arrears to the World Bank and AfDB.
MINING FAVORITE 
Chitando, a former managing director and chairman at the Impala Platinum and Sibanye-Stillwater joint venture platinum miner Mimosa, was favorite to be retained at the mines ministry, to which he was first appointed in Nov. 2017.
Mining generates more than half of Zimbabwe's foreign export earnings and Mnangagwa has said the sector, which is attracting investors in lithium mining, will anchor future economic growth. 
Mnangagwa also appointed ZANU-PF national chairperson Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri as Defence Minister, taking away a key security portfolio from Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, the retired general who led the coup against Mugabe.
Zimbabwean swimming Olympic gold medalist Kirsty Coventry was a surprise pick for the youth and sports ministry in a cabinet that did not include any opposition officials.
Mnangagwa appointed eight new faces to his cabinet but there was no place for long serving ministers Patrick Chinamasa, Obert Mpofu, David Parirenyatwa and Simon Moyo.
""We would want to grow, modernize and mechanize our economy. We believe in the next five years, we will be able to transform our people into middle income citizens,"" Mnangagwa told reporters after his chief secretary announced the cabinet list.
Mnangagwa had earlier received support from former President Robert Mugabe who said he now accepted him as Zimbabwe's legitimate leader after initially accusing him of leading a ""disgraceful"" de facto coup that ended his near four-decades rule last year. 

On the eve of the July 30 vote, Mugabe, 94, said he would vote for the opposition to remove Mnangagwa's ""military government"", expressing bitterness toward his one-time allies in the ruling ZANU-PF party.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said in evidence published on Friday that he was willing to consider new ways to solve the Irish border issue, the toughest of remaining issues in Britain's exit negotiation.
The United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union on March 29, yet little is clear: There is, so far, no full exit deal, rivals to Prime Minister Theresa May are circling and some lawmakers are pushing for a rerun of the 2016 referendum.
Barnier told British lawmakers that he did not agree with May's Chequers proposals on economic and trade policy which he said appeared to be suggesting Britain wanted a ""kind of à la carte single market, a kind of cherrypicking approach"".
The 67-year-old Frenchman also said he was very concerned about the Irish border issue but that the EU was open to discussing different - possibly dispersed and new technological - ways of checking goods crossing the UK-Irish border.
""We are ready to simplify these checks, to have them carried out at a number of different places and have checks, thanks to technical means, which could take different forms,"" said, according to a transcript released by the British parliament
""They could be dispersed. They could take place in different places, on board vessels, in ports outside Ireland, they could be done using technological means, they could be dispersed, as I said, or simplified in technological terms.""
Sterling rose to a one-week high at $1.3029 after Barnier's testimony was reported while against the euro it touched a three-week high. The euro slipped as low as 0.8915 pence.
On Tuesday, a leading EU lawmaker said the bloc could offer new guarantees to Britain to win London's support for a solution aimed at avoiding an Irish border after Brexit.
TIME FOR DECISIONS
If the world’s fifth largest economy left the EU without a deal outlining the divorce details, financial markets would be spooked and trade flows across Europe and beyond could be disrupted.
Both the EU and Britain want to avoid a so-called hard border between UK's Northern Ireland and the EU's Irish Republic because such a border could undermine a 1998 peace agreement that ended decades of sectarian conflict in the north.
But it is still unclear how goods crossing between the EU and the UK in Ireland would be monitored if there is no border and if Northern Ireland, as a part of the UK, leaves both the customs union and the single market.
Barnier repeated that 80 percent of the withdrawal deal was done but that negotiators might need a few extra days beyond the Oct. 18-19 EU Council meeting to get a deal. 
""Where we are now, to be frank, it is not extra time that we need; it is extra decisions,"" Barnier said.
He also told the British lawmakers that if there was no deal then there would be no mini-deals done.

""If there is a no deal there is no more discussion. There is no more negotiation. It is over and each side will take its own unilateral contingency measures, and we will take them in such areas as aviation, but this does not mean mini-deals in the case of a no deal,"" he said.

1638,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>",Myanmar says court in Reuters reporters' case was independent,"By Shoon Naing and Simon Lewis
YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar's government spokesman said on Friday a court that convicted two Reuters journalists under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act was independent and followed due process, after international calls for the pair to be released.
A judge on Monday found Wa Lone, 32, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, guilty of breaching the law on state secrets and sentenced them to seven years in prison. The verdict was criticized by senior United Nations officials and governments including the United States, Britain and Bangladesh, as well as press freedom advocates in Myanmar and around the world.
""The Reuters case is the decision of the court and the court is independent,"" spokesman Zaw Htay told a news conference in the capital Naypyitaw, in the government's first public comments on the case since the verdict. He said he would not comment further to avoid committing contempt of court.
The journalists, who pleaded not guilty, were investigating the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim villagers by the Myanmar security forces at the time of their arrest in December. 
A crackdown by Myanmar soldiers and police in response to militant attacks last year drove about 700,000 Rohingya to flee western Myanmar for Bangladesh, according to U.N. agencies.
Zaw Htay said the government had not sought to influence the court, despite international pressure over the Rohingya crackdown, including a U.N. Security Council meeting on Myanmar in the week before the verdict.
""It means the court does not know about anything else and it continued to do its own process,"" he said. ""This (the verdict) happened and now we have more pressure. But this is proof that we have nothing to do with the court.""
On Thursday, the International Criminal Court ruled it had jurisdiction over Myanmar's alleged deportation of Rohingya, paving the way for the court's prosecutor to further examine whether there is sufficient evidence to file charges.
Zaw Htay declined to comment in detail on that ruling, but said the government would release a statement later responding to the decision.

Myanmar has previously said it was not subject to the court's rulings since the country is not a signatory to the Rome Statute that established the ICC. The court found it had jurisdiction because part of the alleged act of deportation took place in Bangladesh, which is an ICC member state.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, has discussed issues including prisoners, humanitarian access and the reopening of Sanaa airport with Yemeni Foreign Minister Khaled al-Yamani, a U.N. spokeswoman said on Friday.
But Griffiths, who began consultations with the Yemen government delegation in Geneva on Thursday, was still awaiting representatives of the Iranian-allied Houthi movement from the capital Sanaa in order to hold peace talks, U.N. spokeswoman Alessandra Vellucci said.
""He is still working on getting the Ansarullah delegation to Geneva,"" she said.
Meanwhile, she said, he had been discussing confidence-building measures, humanitarian access, Sanaa airport and economic issues with the representatives of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's internationally recognized government. 
The United Nations said on Thursday that Griffiths was not expected to hold any talks at its Geneva offices on Friday. 
But on Friday he was seen holding talks at the hotel of the Yemeni government delegation.
Two sources in the government delegation told Reuters on Thursday they had given Griffiths until noon on Friday to persuade the Houthis to come to Geneva.
As the deadline passed, there was no announcement about whether the talks would be held or not, and a Western diplomat following the peace efforts said there was ""no indication so far"" that the Houthis were coming.
FLIGHT DEMAND
The Houthis appeared to be standing by a demand to use the plane meant to carry their delegation to Geneva to evacuate dozens of injured people to neighboring Oman.
""This condition ... can only interpreted as aiming to obstruct the talks,"" United Arab Emirates Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash tweeted on Friday.
The UAE is a main member of the Saudi-led military coalition that intervened in Yemen's war against the Houthis in 2015 with the aim of restoring Hadi's government. Subsequent peace talks flopped.
Since then, the humanitarian situation has worsened sharply, putting 8.4 million people on the brink of starvation and ruining the already weak economy.
The United Nations wants the government and the Houthi movement to work toward a deal to end the war, remove foreign forces from Yemen and establish a national unity government.
The Houthis' al-Masirah TV reported on Wednesday that the coalition had prevented their delegation flying from Sanaa to Geneva. The Houthis have said the United Nations promised that wounded people could be transported on the flight. 

Hamza al-Kamali, Yemeni deputy minister for youth, told reporters in Geneva on Thursday that the flight had been given clearance three days earlier.

Thohir, who is also chairman of Italian soccer club Inter Milan, was brought in to lead the Asian Games committee in 2015 amid concerns over a ballooning budget and whether some venues would be prepared in time.
""Our national campaign team chief, Erick Thohir, as many of you know, is a successful businessman. He owns media channels, soccer clubs, a basketball club and many others,"" Widodo told a televised news briefing.

Thohir is chairman of the Mahaka group, which owns the Republika newspaper and radio stations, and he also has an investment in U.S. soccer team DC United and was part of a consortium that bought the basketball team the Philadelphia 76ers.
Widodo is running against former general Prabowo Subianto, who was once married to the daughter of former authoritarian leader Suharto, in elections set for April.
Subianto, who narrowly lost the election in 2014 to Widodo, is chairman of the nationalist Gerindra Party which forms the main opposition alongside several Islamic parties.
His campaign manager is a former head of Indonesia's military, Djoko Santoso.
Widodo, a former furniture salesman, is Indonesia's first president to come from outside the political and military elite. 
While in office, Widodo has led a push to build infrastructure though annual growth in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy, at about 5 percent, has yet to reach the 7 percent he pledged when campaigning in 2014.

He has been comfortably ahead in recent opinion polls, but a slide in the rupiah currency to levels not seen since the Asian financial crisis two decades ago has been jumped on by the opposition as a sign of economic mishandling.

KABUL (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met Afghan President Ashraf Ghani during an unannounced visit to Kabul on Friday to discuss prospects for peace talks with the Taliban and the country's deteriorating security situation ahead of upcoming elections.
Mattis was accompanied by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Marine General Joseph Dunford, who earlier in the week had gone to Islamabad with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on a mission to reset testy relations with Pakistan's new government.
The United States has withheld $800 million of military aid from Pakistan this year, having accused Islamabad of turning a blind eye to, or helping, Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network fighters who stage attacks in Afghanistan. Pakistan denies doing so.
The United States is a year into its latest attempt to step up pressure on the Taliban by increasing air strikes and sending thousands more troops to train and advise the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF).
Meeting Ghani in his presidential palace, the U.S. officials discussed progress to end the 17-year-old war, which has become America's longest conflict.
""They discussed peace process, positive impact of the South Asia strategy, reforms in ANDSF, upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections, counter-terrorism and dialogue with Pakistan,"" Ghani's official spokesman said in a tweet after the meeting.
Mattis and Dunford also met U.S. Army General Scott Miller assumed command of NATO forces in Afghanistan on Sunday.
As yet, there is little sign yet of Afghanistan becoming more secure and stable before a parliamentary election next month and a presidential election in April.
During recent weeks, the Taliban killed hundreds of soldiers and police and briefly seized the strategic city of Ghazni in a high profile assault.
Speaking with reporters prior to his arrival in Kabul, Mattis said he was hopeful about peace talks with the Taliban, despite the questions over Washington's strategy in Afghanistan. 
    ""Right now, we have more indications that reconciliation is no longer just a shimmer out there, no longer just a mirage,"" Mattis said. 
    ""It now has some framework, there's some open lines of communication,"" Mattis added.
    Over the summer, a top U.S. State Department official met Taliban officials in Qatar to try to lay the groundwork for broader peace talks. 
    The U.S. government has pointed towards the Taliban accepting a temporary truce in June, as a sign of why the talks should be viewed with hope.
""The most important work that has to be done is beginning the political process and reconciliation,"" Dunford told reporters traveling with him.
""What we are trying to do in the military dimension is convince the Taliban that they cannot win on the battlefield and that they must engage in a peace process.""
Privately, however U.S. officials and experts are more cautious.
    A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said it was unclear how much influence the Taliban officials in Doha, Qatar, had over the group's leadership.
    ""I think that both the U.S. and Afghanistan have perhaps exaggerated the good news in Afghanistan,"" Michael Kugelman, with the Wilson Center think-tank in Washington.
    Two insurgent commanders have told Reuters that the Taliban rejected a second ceasefire offered this month by Ghani.
    CREDIBLE NEGOTIATING PARTNER?
The U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said there were concerns that the Afghan government wasn't doing enough to create programs for Taliban fighters looking to quit the insurgency.
    ""If the Afghan government can be more responsive to disgruntled fighters, that would go a long way in creating legitimacy for the peace process,"" the official said.
Divisions within the Afghan government could also spoil chances of peace talks.
National Security Adviser Hanif Atmar, one of the most powerful figures in the government, has resigned amid speculation he is preparing to challenge Ghani in next year's presidential election.
    ""I would be surprised if anything major happens on the reconciliation front before the presidential election next year because the Taliban simply doesn't see the government as a credible force,"" Kugelman said.
Any talks would not include the Islamic State militant group, which claimed credit for a suicide attack at a wrestling club in the Kabul that killed at least 20 people on Wednesday.
    The Taliban also opposes the Islamic State in Afghanistan, and Mattis noted that provided rare common ground with the Western forces and the Afghan government.

    ""Both the Taliban and the NATO alliance supporting the Afghan government view ISIS in the same light,"" Mattis said.

1643,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>",Gay rights rule change sets up cultural battle in conservative India,"By Alasdair Pal and Sai Sachin Ravikumar
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - When R. Balaji, a 30-year-old gay man from India's IT hub Bengaluru, comes up for white-collar job interviews, recruiters are initially enthusiastic.
It's only when they notice his résumé includes work at an LGBT magazine they go cold, he said. 
His struggles to find a job show the difficulties LGBT Indians have faced for years, and many still expect to face, despite a landmark ruling by India's top court that decriminalized homosexuality on Thursday. 
""They would say 'we'll call you back' or 'you don't have the right experience for this job',"" Balaji said. ""Many of my friends have also faced this issue. It's so difficult to survive in this country where people judge you based on your sexuality.""
Gay sex is considered taboo by many in socially conservative India, and while it no longer carries the previous punishment of up to 10 years in prison, other rights like gay marriage are likely to prove elusive. 
India's government, a broadly right-wing, Hindu nationalist coalition led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, has indicated it will support the Supreme Court in its ruling, but will oppose any attempts by activists to push for further rights. Gay people in India are currently not allowed to marry, adopt children or inherit their partner's wealth should they die. 
A senior government source said the country was ""deeply divided"" on gay marriage, and that the government would challenge any move to legalize it, The Week magazine reported, citing the Press Trust of India. 
CONTINUING BATTLE
LGBT employees say policies to prevent discrimination at work are patchy. 
Vyjayanti Vasanta Mogli, a longtime employee at a leading IT services firm, said she was forced out of her company after she felt emboldened to ""come out"" as a transgender woman to her bosses after a 2014 Supreme Court ruling that allowed trans people to identify as male, female or a third gender.
""They couldn't understand (it), nor were they willing to understand,"" she told Reuters before Thursday's judgment. ""For them it was some unproductive rubbish, some trash that they had to deal with."" 
Mogli, who has been trying to find a job for months, says leading American and European companies based in India routinely invite her to deliver talks about diversity and inclusion, but always shy away from hiring her as a full-time employee. She declined to name the companies as it would affect her employment prospects. 
While several companies including Hindustan  Unilever  (LON:ULVR), Infosys and Godrej told Reuters they welcomed the lifting of Section 377 that criminalized gay sex, others said they had no plans for better workplace rights. 
Avinash Kumar, the head of marketing at consumer goods company Patanjali - one of India's largest private sector employers - told Reuters via text message the idea of rights for gay employees at the company was a ""nonsensical question"". 
""We have better things to ponder over,"" he said. 
Patanjali's founder, Baba Ramdev, a celebrity yoga tycoon with close ties to the BJP http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/india-modi-ramdev, has previously said homosexuality can be ""cured"" by using yoga. 
His spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. 
Mumbai-based conglomerate Godrej has long offered partners of LGBT employees benefits like health insurance despite Section 377, said Parmesh Shahani, head of the Godrej India Culture Lab, that encourages Indian companies to adopt LGBT-friendly policies. 

""So many companies have been using Section 377 as a figleaf to cover their own homophobia,"" he said. ""Now we'll see who really cares.""

1644,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>",Can the pope's accusers force him to resign?,"By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Calls by a Roman Catholic archbishop and his conservative backers for Pope Francis to resign could make it difficult, if not impossible, for him to do so, Church experts say.
Canon (Church) Law says a pope can resign but the decision must be taken freely. In 2013, Francis's predecessor, Benedict, became the first pontiff in six centuries to resign.
Benedict, then 85, abdicated because he said he no longer had the strength to run the Church. Unlike now, no-one had publicly demanded his resignation, which was a surprise even to top Vatican officials. 
HOW DID THE VATICAN AND THE POPE GET TO THIS POINT?
In an 11-page statement published on Aug. 26, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, the former Vatican ambassador to Washington, launched an unprecedented broadside by a Church insider against the pope and a long list of Vatican and U.S. Church officials.
He said that soon after the pontiff's election in 2013, he told Francis that Theodore McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington, D.C., had engaged in sexual misconduct.
He said the pope did nothing and even lifted sanctions that had been imposed on McCarrick by Benedict, the former pope.
Critics of Vigano say his statement has holes and contradictions. They say McCarrick disregarded any sanctions, appearing in public often, even alongside Benedict, in the years after Vigano says the former pope sanctioned McCarrick. Vigano stands by his accusations.
Vigano, who is in hiding and communicating exclusively through reporters for conservative media outlets who helped him prepare, edit and distribute the statement, says there is a ""homosexual network"" in the Vatican that promotes the advancement of gays in the Church.
His statement included no supporting documents.
In July, after U.S. Church officials said there was evidence that McCarrick, 88, had sexually abused a minor more than 50 years ago, Francis sacked him as cardinal and ordered him to live the rest of his life in seclusion, prayer and penitence. Francis' defenders say he took strict action against McCarrick while Benedict had not.
Francis told reporters on his plane returning from Ireland that he would ""not say one word"" about Vigano's accusations. ""Read the document carefully and judge it for yourselves. It speaks for itself,"" he said.
WHAT IS THE GENESIS OF THE CURRENT CONSERVATIVE ESCALATION?
Since his election in 2013, conservatives have sharply criticized Francis, saying he has left many faithful confused by pronouncements that the Church should be more welcoming to homosexuals and divorced Catholics and not be obsessed by ""culture war"" issues such as abortion.
Their attacks on the pope hit a new level with Vigano's broadside. Much of the drama has been played out in newspapers and social media, part of what has become an often shrill proxy war between Francis' defenders and Vigano's allies, who back his call for the pope to step down.
WHAT DOES CANON LAW SAY ABOUT PAPAL RESIGNATIONS?
Canon 332, paragraph two, states:
""If it should happen that the Roman Pontiff resigns his office, it is required for validity that he makes the resignation freely and that it be duly manifested but not that it be accepted by anyone.""
Canon lawyers say much hinges on the interpretation of the word ""freely"" and whether the demands being made by the pope's fiercest critics has constituted enough of a climate of duress to put its validity into doubt.
WHAT DO CANON LAW EXPERTS SAY?
""The pope has the right to freely resign. That's what the canon says. The doubt is whether the situation Francis is in now really allows for a free choice because there is a political faction in the Church trying to force it,"" said Nicholas Cafardi, former dean of Duquesne University School of Law.
""I don't see how (the pope can resign freely) when you have people campaigning for it,"" said Cafardi, who is also a former member of the Board of Governors of the Canon Law Society of America.
Kurt Martens, professor of canon law at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., agreed. 
""I think were are getting to the point of it becoming impossible because the pressure on him is so intense psychologically that it would be impossible to withstand and therefore it would be invalid,"" Martens said.
A Rome-based canon lawyer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of his position in the Church, said he believed a resignation could be possible but that ""it would be very complicated and hairy"" and its validity hotly contested because some would see it as a result of duress.
Edward Peters, a conservative canon lawyer based in Detroit, has said on his blog that Francis should not be considered any different to other bishops who canon law says should resign for just or grave causes. The pope is also bishop of Rome.
But some experts also say two former popes (Benedict and Francis) would be just too much for Catholics to digest and would confuse the faithful.
Father Raymond de Souza, a widely read conservative commentator based in Canada, said it would be wrong to treat ""the papal office as something worldly than can be relinquished under adverse circumstances"". 
WHAT DOES CANON LAW SAY ABOUT PAPAL CONTESTERS?
Canon 1373 says one ""who publicly either stirs up hostilities or hatred among subjects against (a pope) ... is to be punished by an interdict or by other just penalties"".
Cafardi said: ""I think they (the harshest papal critics) are violating it (canon 1373) or are very close to violating it because of the hate they are trying to stir up against Francis"".
CAN A POPE BE DEPOSED?
Not these days. He can die in office or resign of his own free will. There is no impeachment procedure for a pope. 

But Church history is nothing if not colorful. At the start of the 15th century there were three men claiming to be the true pope, each backed by political powers in Europe and Church factions. The Council of Constance, which ran from 1414 to 1418, deposed two of them and the third abdicated.

Ali Avci was arrested last year after the release of a trailer for his film ""Awakening"", based on a failed military putsch in 2016 in which more than 250 people were killed.
The trailer caused public uproar with sequences showing Erdogan's family, including his son-in-law, Finance Minister Berat Albayrak, shot dead, and an army officer pointing a gun at the back of the president's head as he prayed.
An Istanbul court sentenced Avci to 6 years and three months in jail for belonging to the network of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, deemed a terrorist organization by Turkey. Gulen denies Turkey's accusation that he masterminded the coup attempt.
The court said Avci had been carrying out ""public perception management in line with the core goals of the terrorist organization"" through his movie.
Avci denied the charges and said Erdogan himself had repeatedly said he was the target of the failed putsch, which included air strikes on the presidential palace in Ankara, although Erdogan was absent at the time.
""If I was trying to make terrorist propaganda, I would have shown Erdogan making plans to flee, instead of the praying scene,"" Avci told the court.

More than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial and 150,000 state workers including teachers, judges and soldiers have been suspended or dismissed after the coup attempt.

TOKYO (Reuters) - After an earthquake knocked out power to 5.3 million people this week, Hokkaido Electric expects to restore service to most of them by the end of Friday, but experts say the island-wide outage highlights fundamental flaws in Japan's power grid. 
Graphic: Earthquake in Hokkaido - https://tmsnrt.rs/2oJz6zd 
The blackout that hit Japan's northern island of Hokkaido after early Thursday's quake was the nation's worst in seven years, but it would have been less extensive if the utility was not so reliant on one large power station, had spread its plants more widely, and could transfer power more easily from other areas, specialists and energy executives said. 
In the aftermath of Japan's March 2011 disaster, when an earthquake and tsunami caused nuclear meltdowns and widespread power outages, the government mandated a boost in renewable energy supplies, opened up a roughly $70 billion retail electricity market to competition and created a grid oversight company to address these issues. But Hokkaido and other Japanese utilities have been slow to beef up networks and make them more resilient in a country that regularly experiences natural disasters, the specialists said. 
""The crisis is primarily the result of over-reliance on a large coal plant in a centralized generation paradigm,"" said Andrew DeWit, a professor of energy policy at Rikkyo University in Tokyo. 
""That is odd and dangerous, considering the multiplicity of hazards Japan confronts and has experienced in recent years."" 
While not as many people were affected by this week's outage as after the March 2011 quake and tsunami, it was the first time a regional utility in Japan lost its full network, according to the country's Federation of Electric Power Companies. 
Hokkaido Electric Power had restored power to a little more than half of the island's 2.95 million households by Friday afternoon after receiving supplies from nearby Honshu and rebooting some of its generating units. 
The utility's Tomato-Atsuma coal station, which normally supplies about half the island's electricity, remained shut after sustaining damage in the quake. It may take a week to restore power fully to Hokkaido. 
Hokkaido Electric aims to have power restored to about 80 percent of the island's households by the end of Friday, according to Japan industry minister Hiroshige Seko. 
The abrupt halt in supplies from Tomato-Atsuma, which has three coal-fired generators, caused such a huge imbalance in supply and demand that other power plants on Hokkaido were tripped and shut down. 
""Adjusting supply and demand is very difficult. Hokkaido's power grid is small and the share of Tomato-Atsuma is large, so it must have been much a more difficult a situation than after the big earthquake that struck eastern Japan,"" said Tsutomu Oyama, professor of electrical engineering at Yokohama National University. 
With its only nuclear plant shut pending approval to restart under new safety guidelines imposed since the Fukushima meltdowns of 2011, Hokkaido Electric has been investing in a new gas-fired station and expanding the capacity of its connection to Honshu. Cost cuts have slowed the process. 
It plans to start operations of the gas-fired unit next month and complete a 50 percent expansion in capacity on the Hokkaido-Honshu connection by March next year, a Hokkaido Electric spokesman told Reuters. Those transmission lines currently can supply only about 600 megawatts of power. 
Asked if there were lessons from 2011 that could have been applied to help mitigate the current situation, the spokesman said the utility had conducted drills for scenarios including the shutdown of all three units at Tomato-Atsuma but did not provide details. 
""It is difficult to answer this question because the 2011 quake and yesterday's quake are different situations,"" he said.

TRIPOLI/TUNIS (Reuters) - Residents of Tripoli emerging from their homes to take advantage of a ceasefire between armed groups noticed one thing straight away. The militias had not withdrawn their heavy weapons from strategic locations in the Libyan capital.
A truce brokered by the United Nations on Tuesday after a week of violence between local fighters has largely been observed.
The clashes, which left dozens dead, pitted four big armed groups in Tripoli against rivals from other towns. The fighters had joined forces in 2011 to topple Muammar Gaddafi but since then they have refused to disarm, using their guns to compete for access to public funds.
But even as the ceasefire began, residents and diplomats braced themselves for more violence.
The factions withdrew their pickup trucks mounted with anti-aircraft guns and dismantled checkpoints. But they kept their heavy weapons at key positions such as Matiga airport, government ministries and some of the city's main streets.
""It's good that there is no fighting now but the two sides are still in their positions,"" said a frightened resident who gave his name only as Mohamed. ""I am afraid clashes will erupt any time.""
The armed groups have vowed to resume hostilities if talks to be hosted by U.N. Special Envoy Ghassan Salame do not result in a lasting settlement.
""We are committed to the ceasefire as long it has not been breached by the other side,"" said Ahmad Ben Salim, spokesman for the Special Deterrence Force, one of the biggest Tripoli units.
""Our force is still in its position ... and we are waiting for what will emerge with the ceasefire.""
The force's main opponent, known as the 7th Brigade, also confirmed to Reuters it would stay in its positions.
SPEECH
In a blunt speech at the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday, Salame said groups that violate the ceasefire must be held to account and the time for impunity was over.
Salame has been trying for a year to pave the way for national elections. But he gave no details of what he planned to do if the truce was broken.
""It was encouraging that he overtly states that impunity must end,"" said Tarek Megerisi, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.
""However, as always the implementation details are absent,"" Megerisi said. ""How will the monitoring and punitive measures he mentions work in practice?"" 
A Western diplomat added: ""Salame needs to do something bold now but it's not clear what he could do. If nothing happens it will be a break for the militias to recharge their batteries.""
With no national army or foreign peacekeepers in place, the only short-term fix would be to allow some of the groups from outside Tripoli to pay their fighters from public funds.
Turning young men with guns into civil servants has been the main policy goal since 2011, but it has not succeeded.
As the armed groups became greedier, and emptying state coffers to pay them off left little money to fix dilapidated hospitals and other infrastructure, frustrated youths were driven to join the militias.
Militias have meanwhile been looking for new sources of funds. Diplomats said fighters providing security for ministries are forcing officials to provide letters of credit intended for imports. These are used to obtain foreign currency which can be changed on the black market at a favorable rate.
POWERS
After the fall of Gaddafi, Western powers tried to train a Libyan army. But that plan ended in 2014 when the country split into rival administrations in west and east.
The powers have since switched tactics, allowing the U.N.-backed administration in Tripoli to legitimate ""super militias"", giving them state funds and titles for the sake of stability.
Salame is now expected to negotiate a broader power sharing agreement under which more fighters will be brought in with the aim of securing Tripoli.
However, diplomats fear that General Khalifa Haftar, who has conquered much of the east with his Libyan National Army faction and is said to be planning to run for president, may intervene in Tripoli.
""The liberation of Tripoli in accordance with a military plan is an inevitable choice,"" Haftar said on Thursday. ""The crisis in Tripoli must end as soon as possible and we cannot be silent in the current situation.""
Haftar has long contemplated extending his influence in the west of Libya by linking up with local groups there.
Since the outbreak of fighting in Tripoli, pro-Haftar TV channels have supported the 7th Brigade, which comes from Tarhouna, south of Tripoli.
But the Tarhouna forces cooperate with an Islamist commander, Salah Badi, an opponent of the general. Haftar meanwhile has built a reputation for fighting people he calls ""Islamist terrorists"".
Such fragile alliances show how difficult it will be for Salame, the sixth U.N. Libya envoy since 2011, to build on the ceasefire.
Those who have met him recently say he has been frustrated by lack of progress since unveiling a peace plan a year ago that would entail a new constitution and a national government.

If Salame succeeds it will be a ""coup"" for him, a diplomat said, but if not, his standing in Libya will be damaged.

1649,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 07:00AM ET</span>",Russian fury over pension age hike clouds Moscow mayoral election,"By Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Polls show President Vladimir Putin's former chief-of-staff will comfortably be re-elected Moscow's mayor on Sunday, but public anger over planned increases to the nationwide pension age means many voters may stay away, tarnishing his win.
The election is the first test at the ballot box for the authorities since Putin, whose popularity has tumbled by around 15 percent due to anger over the changes, intervened to soften the reform last week. 
The changes, going through parliament, are the most unpopular government measure since a 2005 move to scrap Soviet-eras benefits led to nationwide pensioner protests. 
Frontrunner Sergei Sobyanin, who has run Moscow since 2010, has recorded a rare personal appeal to voters asking them to show up to vote.
Sobyanin has also promised to protect Moscow's around three million pensioners, who like the rest of the country face a phased five-year increase in the pension age. 
After being amended by Putin, the reforms envisage raising the retirement age for men to 65 from 60 and to 60 from 55 for women. Average life expectancy for men is 66 and for women 77.
""It's clear that Sobyanin will win, but turnout will be really low because there is a protest mood in society,"" Dmitry Oreshkin, an independent political analyst, said.
""It's a Soviet-type of protest when people carp in their kitchens but believe there's no point in taking part in any official procedure.""
Polls show just under one third of the seven million registered voters will turn up. 
Turnout at the last Moscow mayoral election in 2013 was just over 32 percent. Official turnout at previous mayoral elections, which critics say have often been falsified, varied from 57 to 66 percent. 
Elections to select the heads of another 25 of Russia's 85 regions will also be held on Sunday.
FREE CONCERT TICKETS
The authorities' approach to the Moscow vote has been to exclude awkward candidates and mount a get-out-the-vote operation, a sign the Kremlin takes anger over the pension changes, which polls show most Russians oppose, seriously.
Opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who ran against Sobyanin in 2013 and had planned to lead a protest against the proposed pension changes on Sunday, will spend election day behind bars after being convicted of violating protest laws. 
His supporters plan to demonstrate across Russia.
Registration rules that allow the ruling United Russia party to decide who takes part in the election were used to prevent two liberal opposition candidates from running against Sobyanin. His four rivals are virtual unknowns.
The get-out-the-vote push has involved 10,000 volunteers and a billboard campaign. Young Muscovites are being offered free concert tickets if they vote, voting hours have been extended and voting stations will be set up outside Moscow to allow people spending time at their dachas or country houses to vote.
Candidates for the Communist Party and the Fair Russia Party oppose the pension changes. But Sobyanin, who polls show should win around 70 percent of the vote, has declined to debate them on TV.
""Sobyanin is a smart person,"" said Oreshkin. ""He talks about road building, but not about politics. He understands that speaking about pension reform would be extremely painful for him."" 
Sobyanin, 60, seen by some in the elite as a possible future president or more likely prime minister, has transformed the face of Moscow.
With an annual budget of around 2 trillion roubles ($28.90 billion) he has overseen the city's biggest post-Soviet overhaul of public transport, roads and parks, at times even winning plaudits from anti-Kremlin critics.
Detractors say this renewal is to pacify young and middle class Muscovites who have voted for Putin in smaller numbers than the rest of the country in the past.
The strategy has had some success, say experts, but when it comes to Sunday's election the agenda is much broader. 
""It's impossible to separate the city's agenda from the federal agenda,"" wrote Alexander Baunov, a senior fellow at Moscow's Carnegie Centre think tank, last week.

""It's hard to create a situation where the election will be focused on questions of transport, pavements and parks, rather than on pension reform, Donbass (separatist-controlled east Ukraine) and the Russian authoritarian tradition.""

1650,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 06:38AM ET</span>",Former British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and wife to divorce,"LONDON (Reuters) - Boris Johnson, Britain's former foreign secretary, said on Friday he had separated from his wife Marina Wheeler and the couple will divorce, the Press Association reported.
Johnson is the bookmakers' favorite to succeed Prime Minister Theresa May and is seen as someone who would lead Britain to a more radical departure from the European Union after being the figurehead of the ""Leave"" campaign in 2016.
In a joint statement, Johnson and Wheeler said they separated some time ago and divorce proceedings had started. Johnson's former adviser confirmed that a statement had been issued to the Press Association.
The statement came after the Sun newspaper ran a front page story saying the couple, who have four children, had separated.
""Several months ago, after 25 years of marriage, we decided it was in our best interests to separate. We have subsequently agreed to divorce and that process is under way,"" the statement said, according to the Press Association. 
Reuters attempted to contact Johnson, a former mayor of London, directly through phone calls to his office and by email.
Johnson is one of the most recognizable figures in British politics thanks to his shock of blonde hair and colorful turn of phrase. Advocates of Brexit say he is the man who should succeed May, and he is popular with the party's grassroots.
""He's still the favorite,"" said bookmaker William Hill spokesman Joe Crilly, commenting on the odds of Johnson being the party's next leader. ""Over the years Boris has been very Teflon ... we think he's got more than a couple of lives left yet.""
Johnson served as foreign minister under May for two years until July, when he quit in protest at her Brexit negotiating strategy, saying it would leave Britain as a ""colony"" of the European Union.
Since then, he has repeatedly criticized the strategy in parliament and through his regular newspaper column.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Rescue workers with dogs searched for survivors on Friday in debris-strewn landslides caused by an earthquake in Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, as electricity was restored to just over half of households.
Public broadcaster NHK put the death toll at 12, with five people unresponsive. Earlier, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said 16 had died, but Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga later clarified in updated numbers that nine had been confirmed dead and nine others were in a state of cardiopulmonary arrest, a term typically used before death is confirmed.
Another 24 were still missing after Thursday's pre-dawn magnitude-6.7 quake, the latest deadly natural disaster to hit Japan over the past two months, coming after typhoons, floods and a record-breaking heat wave.

Nearly 5,000 Hokkaido residents spent the night in evacuation centers where food was distributed in the morning.
""It was an anxious night with several aftershocks, but we took encouragement from being together and now we're grateful for some food,"" one woman told public broadcaster NHK. 
Some 22,000 rescue workers had worked through the night to search for survivors, Abe told an emergency meeting on Friday. With rain forecast for Friday afternoon and Saturday, he urged people to be careful about loose soil that could cause unstable houses to collapse or further landslides.
""We will devote all our energy to saving lives,"" Abe said.
As of Friday afternoon, Hokkaido Electric Power Co had restored power to 1.54 million of the island's 2.95 million households. The utility aimed to raise that number to 2.4 million, or over 80 percent, by the end of Friday, industry minister Hiroshige Seko said.
Flights resumed from midday at Hokkaido's main airport, New Chitose. The island, about the size of Austria and with 5.3 million people, is a popular tourist destination known for its mountains, lakes, rolling farmland and seafood.
LANDSLIDES WRECK HOMES
Soldiers in fatigues and orange-clad rescue workers searched for survivors, picking through debris on huge mounds of earth near the epicenter in Atsuma in southern Hokkaido. Aerial footage showed rescuers with dogs walking through the destruction.
All the missing people are from the Atsuma area, where dozens of landslides wrecked homes and other structures and left starkly barren hillsides. 
""I just hope they can find him quickly,"" one unidentified man told NHK as he watched the search for his missing neighbor.
The quake damaged the big Tomato-Atsuma plant, which normally supplies half of Hokkaido's power and is located near the epicenter, forcing it to automatically shut down. That caused such instability in the grid that it tripped all other power stations on the island, causing a full blackout.
Hokkaido Electric was bringing other smaller plants back on line and also receiving some power transferred through undersea cables from the main island of Honshu. 
Kansai International Airport in western Japan has been shut since Typhoon Jebi ripped through Osaka on Tuesday, although some domestic flights operated by Japan Airlines Co Ltd and ANA Holdings Inc's low-cost carrier Peach Aviation resumed on Friday, the carriers said.
JR Hokkaido planned to resume bullet train operations from midday. It was also trying to resume other train services on Friday afternoon, a spokesman said.
Manufacturers were still affected by power outages.
Toyota Motor Corp's Tomakomai factory, which makes transmissions and other parts, said operations remained suspended indefinitely until power was restored, a spokesman said.
Toppan Printing Co Ltd's operations at a plant in Chitose, which makes food packages, would remain suspended until it regained power, a spokesman said.
The quake prompted Japan's Self-Defense Forces to cancel two joint military exercises in Hokkaido, including the first-ever drill with Australian fighter jets, and a training exercise with the U.S. Marine Corps.

A soccer friendly between Japan and Chile scheduled for Friday in Hokkaido's main city of Sapporo was also called off.

DAMASCUS (Reuters) - Syria's government is showcasing its ambitions for economic recovery and engagement with foreign business at a trade fair, but glimpses of devastated districts nearby show how far off full-scale reconstruction remains.
While companies from Syria's allies Russia and Iran are present in numbers, others are sparse, deterred by Western sanctions and continued ostracism of Syria as it prepares to attack the last rebel bastion in a seven-year-old civil war. 
""Today the Syrian army forces have gained a lot of momentum ... We think this year (the trade fair) will be very successful. A lot of companies that were not in Syria last year came,"" said Samer al-Debs, head of the Damascus Chamber of Industry, as the fair opened on Thursday night. 
Although South Korean cars are now trundling off assembly lines in Syria, and there is electricity in Damascus for 20 hours a day, whole towns lie in ruins and millions are sheltering abroad as refugees.
While global attention focuses on northwest Syria, where the army is preparing to attack the last active stronghold of armed rebellion - at the risk of triggering a humanitarian crisis, according to the United Nations - Damascus is experiencing its first peaceful summer in years. 
President Bashar al-Assad retook the last insurgent enclaves around the capital this spring through heavy bombardment after years of siege, ending frequent rebel mortar fire on the city center. 
Last year, one such mortar round struck the entrance to the Damascus International Trade Fair as it opened for the first time in five years, killing six people during an event the government had heralded as a move toward economic revival.
SHRAPNEL MARKS
The shrapnel marks are still visible, but the only sound of an explosion on Thursday came from distant de-mining operations in an area recaptured months ago. 
On each side of the road to the fair - the main highway from Damascus to its international airport - lie districts that were recently on the front lines, and where most buildings seem little more than concrete husks, their roofs caved in. 
Inside the trade fair, companies display goods imported from dozens of countries, including Japanese electronics and South Korean Kia cars assembled in Syria under licence. 
Still, in a sign of the fraught international realities surrounding the war, the countries with most companies present are Russia and Iran – Assad's closest military allies, themselves also subject to Western sanctions. 
In the Iranian pavilion, stalls displaying delicate silk carpets stand next to others advertising industrial and agricultural equipment. 
""There is technical, scientific and industrial capability in Iran and it is in line with the demands present in the Syrian market,"" said Iranian Ambassador Javad Turk Abadi.
Across the aisle in the Russian pavilion, one company was selling armored bulldozers for clearing unexploded bombs in city rubble, and another was seeking contracts for electricity cables in a country where the power network has been ruined. 
FLAGS
The geopolitics are also clear in the flags along the highway – which include not only those of Russia and Iran but also those of Venezuela and North Korea, two countries at odds with the United States and much of the West. 
Attending the opening ceremony along with Syrian Prime Minister Imad Khamis was the leader of Abkhazia, a breakaway Georgian republic recognised by few countries apart from Russia and Syria. Its flag, and that of another Russian-backed Georgian breakaway republic, South Ossetia, fly near the entrance. 
Western countries have said they will not aid reconstruction without a political solution to the conflict, but as Assad reclaims more rebel territory with Russian and Iranian backing, the prospect of any deal with opposition groups is receding. 
They have also said they will not ease sanctions; the difficulty of trading with Syria is a constant refrain among companies at the trade fair.
Money transfers are very difficult, complicating payments for import or export, and foreign companies fear inadvertently doing business with sanctioned individuals or entities. 
Despite that, Syrian businesses appear to be finding ways around the sanctions and growing, as the past few years of army advances have brought Syria's most populous areas back into a large contiguous zone of government control. 

""Sanctions are always a problem. We're finding ways around it ... we adapted ourselves to the situation,"" said Fares Shehabi, head of the Aleppo chamber of commerce and industry, who is himself on a European Union sanctions list for his support for Assad.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A wildfire burned unchecked early on Friday in northern California, threatening homes and shutting down an interstate highway where motorists had to race from their vehicles.
The Delta Fire has already scorched 22,000 acres (8,903 hectares) since it began on Wednesday in a Shasta-Trinity National Forest canyon along the Sacramento River, about 250 miles (402 km) north of San Francisco, the California Interagency Incident Management Team said in an advisory.
As of Thursday, firefighters had been unable to contain the blaze, said Brandon Vaccaro, a spokesman for the Delta fire command team, but a gradual rise in humidity is forecast, which could help slow the fire's growth. 
A stretch of Interstate 5 remained closed on Friday after the fire came near the highway. Motorists were forced to flee on foot on Wednesday before flames engulfed their cars and trucks, local media reported and fire officials said. 
The fire was threatening about 150 homes and other buildings in the sparsely populated region. About 300 people were under mandatory evacuation orders, Vaccaro said on Thursday.
Farther north, an evacuation warning was in effect for the town of Dunsmuir, advising some 1,600 residents to be ready to flee at a moment's notice.
The blaze was near the site of the Carr fire, which killed eight people and incinerated hundreds of dwellings in and around the town of Redding this summer, becoming one of California's most destructive wildfires on record. No casualties have been reported from the Delta Fire. 
The blaze has raged with the same intensity seen in several wildfires in recent months. Fueled by drought-ravaged pine forests thick with dead and dying timber, flames spread quickly, leaping from tree-top to tree-top and hurling showers of embers into more dried-out vegetation.

The Delta fire was one of about 15 blazes burning across California this week. Three times more ground has burned in California so far this year than at the same point in 2017, which ranks as one of the most destructive seasons on record.

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe has said he now accepts President Emmerson Mnangagwa as the country's legitimate leader after initially accusing him of leading a ""disgraceful"" de facto coup that ended his near four-decades rule last year.
On the eve of the July 30 vote, Mugabe said he would vote for the opposition to remove Mnangagwa's ""military government"", as the 94-year-old leader expressed bitterness and turned against his one-time allies in the ruling ZANU-PF party.
But at a funeral wake of his mother-in-law, Mugabe said Mnangagwa's victory, which is still disputed by his main opponent Nelson Chamisa, made him a legitimate president, the privately-owned NewsDay and state-owned The Herald newspapers reported on Friday.
""The wrong that happened last November has been erased by his victory in the July 30 elections. We now have a government born out of the constitution. I now accept his leadership and he now deserves the support of every Zimbabwean,"" Mugabe said, looking frail in video footage on an online television site.
""Before the elections, I did not support him because he came through illegal means which violated our liberation values that politics lead the gun,"" added Mugabe, likely ending the feud between the new president and his former mentor.
Mugabe's forced resignation divided ZANU-PF and created mistrust between the army on one side and the police and intelligence agency on the other, but the rapprochement could help overcome those differences and rally others behind Mnangagwa. 
The military last year intervened after expulsions of ZANU-PF officials that were sympathetic to Mnangagwa, then Mugabe's deputy, and to stop the presidential ambitions of the wife of the veteran former leader.
Mugabe's wife Grace and a ZANU-PF faction known as G40 had been resisting Mnangagwa's rise to power. Mugabe again denied that he had planned to install Grace as his preferred successor, NewsDay and The Herald reported on Friday.

At the wake Grace also said people should pray for her husband, who she said was not feeling well. The couple have traveled to Singapore several times this year for Mugabe's medical treatment.

Both countries have been battling Islamic State's influence, with Jordan playing a key role in an international coalition, and the Philippines on alert after a five-month occupation of a city by Islamist rebels - its worst conflict since World War Two.
""If there is anything that we can do, if you are short in your army, let me know,"" Duterte said on Thursday at a business forum in Amman in a comment to King Abdullah, who earlier lamented the ""evil"" both states were facing.
""You need one battalion... I will send them to you. I will commit my government in the right side of history.""
King Abdullah is an important Middle East ally of Western powers, with Jordan playing a prominent role in the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, providing military, logistical and intelligence support.
Earlier this year, Jordan announced it will provide the Philippines with two Cobra attack helicopters to help fight insurgents.

Duterte is on a six-day visit to Jordan and Israel, and his activities have been broadcast in the Philippines. He has signed agreements with Israeli companies to buy small arms, armored vehicles, and surveillance and reconnaissance equipment.

PYONGYANG (Reuters) - North Korea's celebrations marking its 70th anniversary on Sunday are expected to showcase a country that has secured a nuclear arsenal and is now focusing on developing its economy and cultivating international relations.
Sunday's events will kick off about a month of performances, as well as a trade show and other visits designed to drum up foreign investment and tourism spending in the sanctions-strapped country.
Having declared his nuclear program ""complete,"" North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will use Sunday's events to highlight his renewed focus on economic development, and possibly his diplomatic campaign that has netted him historic summits with the United States, China and South Korea this year, analysts say.
""It is a day Kim Jong Un should reminisce the past 70 years of the republic, and it is an event where he has the pressure to offer a long-term statecraft vision that looks into more than 10 years that follow,"" said Hong Min, senior researcher of Korea Institute for National Unification.
""However, it won’t be easy for him this weekend, because he did not really achieve anything ground-breaking after he changed the national policy line to economy-first.”
Economic sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear weapons development have been squeezing the impoverished state, where some 40 percent of the population, or more than 10 million people, need humanitarian assistance and about 20 percent of children suffer from malnutrition, according to U.N. estimates.
Under Kim’s one-man rule, the country has also been accused of widespread human rights abuses, with a U.N. report last year estimating between 80,000 and 120,000 people are held in prison camps.
TOURIST CASH
State media have called for the day to be ""a celebration of the victor and continuously expand the results of the big economic development march.""
For the first time in five years, Pyongyang is organizing ""Mass Games,"" a huge, nationalist pageant performed by up to 100,000 people in one of the world's largest stadiums. [L3N1VQ3M3]
In downtown Pyongyang on Thursday, thousands of children in school uniforms could be seen practicing marching and playing music in Kim Il Sung square, and on street corners throughout the city. 
Posters on major roads commemorated the anniversary and crews were seen patching the road between the airport and the city center. One Air Koryo flight from Beijing to Pyongyang observed by Reuters was fully booked, mostly with foreign tourists and media.
The events, especially the photogenic Mass Games, offer North Korea a chance to raise foreign currency from thousands of international visitors pouring into the capital, at a time when tourism remains one of the few remaining reliable sources of income amid U.N. sanctions targeting 90 percent of its $3 billion annual exports.
While ticket prices for past Mass Games topped out at 300 euros ($350), this year VIP seats cost 800 euros, said Simon Cockerell, general manager for the Koryo Tours agency. The cheapest seats are 100 euros, with several other pricing brackets in between.
Despite the costs, demand is strong, he said.
""There’s very high interest,"" Cockerell said. ""All the flights are full, all the hotels are full. It’s quite telling that Chinese tour companies were banned by the North Korean side from taking in any tourists until the middle of September, simply for capacity reasons.""
The Korea Maritime Institute, a South Korean think-tank, estimates tourism generates $44 million a year for the isolated country, with Chinese tourists making up about 80 percent of foreign visitors to the North.
FOREIGN VISITORS
So far, only one head of state, from Mauritania, is known to be visiting North Korea for the celebrations, something North Korea blames the United States for.
""The U.S. is ... forcing other countries not to send high-level delegations to the celebrations of the 70th founding anniversary of the DPRK,"" the North's foreign ministry said in a statement published by state media KCNA last month. 
After weeks of speculation that Chinese President Xi Jinping may make his first visit to Pyongyang on Sunday, Beijing announced on Tuesday the Chinese delegation would instead be led by parliament chief Li Zhanshu.
North Korea is also hosting a trade show and other trips aimed at attracting foreign investors later in September, but many will remain wary of sanctions that still block many aspects of trade with the North.
Michael Spavor, a Canadian business consultant who heads Paektu Cultural Exchange, said he is working with the North Korean government to bring about 25 Chinese investors and entrepreneurs to tour potential projects in Pyongyang, Wonsan and Nampho.
""We will attend matchmaking sessions with various government officials and stakeholders as well as visiting existing and future development zones,"" Spavor told Reuters.
MILITARY DISPLAY?
Also on the expected schedule for Sunday is a torchlight procession, as well as a military parade, which will be closely watched for signs of new ballistic missiles or other advanced weaponry.
North Korea routinely uses major holidays to showcase its military capabilities and the latest developments in missile technology.
The website 38 North says satellite imagery suggests the military component of Sunday's parade could be bigger than one held earlier this year, although no long-range ballistic missiles or their launchers have been spotted.
""Display of military prowess has always been crucial in North Korean statecraft,"" Hong, the researcher, said.
""But North Korea does know that if they do display ICBMs, the international society will doubt their willingness for denuclearization. It’s highly unlikely that North Korea would be risking it.”

1659,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 04:00AM ET</span>",Australia's new prime minister to face hostile parliament in test of mettle,"By Colin Packham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's new Prime Minister Scott Morrison, elected to heal his fractured party, faces his biggest test on Monday, in steering the government through a hostile first session of parliament.
Picked last month by the ruling Liberal Party to become the sixth prime minister in the last decade, following a backbench revolt that ousted predecessor Malcolm Turnbull, Morrison has enjoyed a brief honeymoon period.
""How Morrison performs over the next fortnight will be critical,"" John Hewson, former leader of the Liberal Party, told Reuters.
""Bill Shorten, leader of Australia’s Labor Party, will be sitting like a mosquito in a nudist colony, he has so much to bite into,"" he added.
""The only trouble he will have is deciding where to begin."" 
Labor is the largest opposition party.
But even before Morrison even faces opposition lawmakers as leader for the first time, he will have to contend with Australia's most prominent political poll, due to be published late on Sunday. 
The influential Newspoll, which has been a key driver in the demise of several leaders, showed support for Morrison's government at a decade low last month.
Keen to minimize the impact, cabinet ministers said the next Newspoll result would improve quickly. But another poor poll outcome would step up pressure on the government.
DEEP FRACTURES
Morrison, a former treasurer, has spent his first two weeks as leader trying to heal factional divides and soften his public image, culminating in a call for ""Australians to love each other"". 
A compromise candidate, he only won after moderates rallied behind him, enabling the defeat of right-wing rival and home affairs minister Peter Dutton.
But Morrison's slim victory margin of just five votes shows how deep the party divide is.
One of those votes was cast by Turnbull, whose resignation from parliament cost Morrison his parliamentary majority. With 75 elected lawmakers, the government is one shy of an outright majority.
""There are some bruised people in the party,"" said Grahame Morris, former chief of staff to ex-prime minister John Howard.
Desperate to heal the rift, Morrison has retained in their cabinet positions nearly all the conservative activists behind Turnbull's ouster.
Appointments of influential conservatives were key to demonstrate the party's center-right credentials and heal the deep wounds, said former treasurer Peter Costello.
Yet Morrison's soothing effort will be complicated by the task of having to defend Dutton against growing pressure over accusations of improperly handing out immigration visas.
Dutton denies the accusation, although opposition lawmakers had called for Morrison to remove his home affairs minister.
Morrison can ill-afford to lose Dutton, a leading conservative, as he chalks out a route to meeting Paris Accord commitments to cut carbon emissions.
Climate change is domestic political dynamite in Australia, one of the world’s largest exporters of coal.
BULLYING
Political pressure may also come from within Morrison's own party.
Still reeling from a turbulent leadership battle that roiled financial markets, several backbench lawmakers have accused Dutton's supporters of unduly pressuring them to back him.
Morrison vowed not to be distracted by the accusations, however.

""Australians are less interested in how politicians feel,"" he told reporters in Melbourne on Friday. ""They want us to be interested in how they feel. And that's what my focus is.""

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's new government canceled the appointment of a renowned Princeton economist to its Economic Advisory Council, an official said on Friday, after a strong backlash against the choice of a member of the Ahmadi religious minority.
The failure of Prime Minister Imran Khan's government to resist pressure to drop economist Atif Mian reflects the increasing clout of hardline Islamists, whose parties won around 10 percent of the vote at the last election in July.
Faced with a looming balance of payments crisis that may force the country to seek a fresh bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), or other lenders, the government had picked Mian to join an 18-member council to advise prime minister Khan.
Aged 43, and a scholar in the field of finance and macroeconomics, Mian is regarded as one of the world's top young economists.
The prime minister's adviser on media, Iftikhar Durrani, confirmed that Mian’s appointment had been revoked, while the government's main spokesman alluded to the pressure the government had come under from religious quarters.
""The government wants to move forward with the religious leaders and all segments of society, and if one nomination gives a different impression, then it's not appropriate,"" Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said on Twitter.
Chaudhry had previously defended Mian's appointment saying: ""Pakistan belongs as much to minorities as it does to the majority.""
The government, however, changed course following a widespread social media campaign criticizing the appointment and protest threats by the emergent ultra-right Tehreek-e-Labbaik party.
Under Pakistani law, Ahmadis are forbidden from calling themselves Muslims or using Islamic symbols in their religious practices. They face discrimination and violence over accusations their faith insults Islam, including impediments blocking them from voting in general elections.
The Ahmadis consider themselves to be Muslims but their recognition of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who founded the sect in British-ruled India in 1889, as a “subordinate prophet” is viewed by many of the Sunni majority as a breach of the Islamic tenet that the Prophet Mohammad was God’s last direct messenger.
""Whenever and wherever any Ahmadi is needed to serve the nation they will be the first to offer their services,"" community spokesman Salim Ud Din told Reuters when asked to comment on Mian's removal from the council.

Police arrested the 12 Thai Facebook users this week for violating a cyber-crime law, in connection with their posts about what police have deemed to be an untrue complaint of rape.
Police had been investigating an accusation by a 19-year-old British tourist who said she had been raped while on holiday on the island of Koh Tao in June.
A lawyer for the 12, Winyat Chatmontree, said they had been arrested under the Computer Crime Act. They face up to five years in prison and fines for spreading false information and damaging national security, if found guilty.
Thailand is sensitive about how it is perceived abroad, particularly because of any impact on tourism which is an important driver of the economy.
Arrest warrants have also been issued for the British publisher of the online newspaper Samui Times, and the Thai-American administrator of the CSI LA Facebook page, for reporting the story and raising concern about the standard of the police work.
Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said the police appeared to be using computer-related crime charges against anyone who questioned their investigation of the case.
""The authorities should immediately drop these bogus charges,"" Adams said in a statement. 
The British tourist, whose identity has not been revealed, reported to police in June that she was robbed on the island. But upon her return to Britain, she told police there that she had also been raped.
Media have reported that the woman said she was turned away by Thai police when she tried to report the rape. 
Police deny this and say their investigation determined her complaint of rape was not true.
""The 12 arrested shared information ... which affects Thailand's image, because according to our investigation the incident alleged by the British tourist never took place,"" Napah Senatip, deputy inspector of Koh Tao police, told Reuters.
Concerns over safety on Koh Tao were heightened after it made headlines in 2014 when the bodies of British backpackers Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were found on a beach.
They had been bludgeoned to death.
Two Myanmar migrant workers were found guilty in 2015 of killing the pair. They have been sentenced to death.

JUIZ DE FORA, Brazil (Reuters) - The leading candidate in Brazil's presidential election is in serious but stable condition after being stabbed by an assailant at a campaign rally on Thursday, doctors said, pushing an already chaotic campaign into further disarray.
Far-right firebrand Congressman Jair Bolsonaro, a controversial figure who has enraged many Brazilians for years with divisive comments, but has a devout following among conservative voters, could take two months to fully recover and will spend at least a week in the hospital, said Dr. Luiz Henrique Borsato, who operated on the candidate. 
""His internal wounds were grave and put the patient's life at risk,"" Borsato said, adding that a serious challenge now would be preventing an infection that could be caused by the perforation of Bolsonaro's intestines. 
The attack on Bolsonaro, 63, is a dramatic twist in what was already Brazil's most unpredictable election since the country's return to democracy three decades ago. Corruption investigations have jailed scores of powerful businessmen and politicians in recent years, and alienated infuriated voters.
There were fears that violence could flare across Brazil on Friday, as the nation celebrates its Independence Day and political groups are expected to march in hundreds of cities. Bolsonaro's rival candidates called off their campaign activities for Friday.
ELECTION IMPACT
Under Brazilian campaign laws, Bolsonaro's tiny coalition has almost no campaign time on government-regulated candidate ad blocs on TV and radio. That means he relies deeply on social media and raucous rallies around the country to drum up support. If Bolsonaro is not able to go out in the streets, it could jeopardize his campaign. 
But Flavio Bolsonaro, the candidate's son, said early Friday outside the hospital where his father was treated that he was conscious and the attack was a political boost. 
""I just want to send a message to the thugs who tried to ruin the life of a family man, a guy who is the hope for millions of Brazilians: You just elected him president. He will win in the first round,"" said Flavio Bolsonaro.
Bolsonaro, a retired Army captain, is running as the law-and-order candidate and positioned himself as the anti-politician despite having spent nearly three decades in Congress where he has managed to author just a few laws.
He has long espoused taking a radical stance on public security in Brazil, which according to United Nations statistics has more homicides than any other country. 
Bolsonaro, whose trademark pose at rallies is a ""guns up"" gesture with both hands to make them resemble pistols, says he would encourage police to kill suspected drug gang members and other armed criminals with abandon.
He has openly praised Brazil's military dictatorship and in the past said it should have killed more people. 
In casting his vote on the floor of Congress for the 2016 impeachment of former President Dilma Rousseff, he dedicated his ballot to the military regime figure who oversaw the prison where Rousseff was jailed for three years and brutally tortured. 
Bolsonaro faces trial before the Supreme Court for speech that prosecutors said incited hate and rape. He has called the charges politically motivated. 
Political violence is rampant in Brazil at the local level. 
For instance, in the months before 2016 city council elections in Baixada Fluminense, a hardscrabble region the size of Denmark that surrounds Rio de Janeiro, at least 13 politicians or candidates were murdered before ballots were cast.
Earlier this year, Marielle Franco, a Rio city councilwoman who was an outspoken critic of police violence against slum residents, was assassinated. 
But violence against national political figures, even in the extremely heated political climate that has engulfed Brazil in recent years, is rare. 
SUSPECT CAUGHT
The Federal Police said in a statement that it had officers escorting Bolsonaro at the time of the knife attack and the ""aggressor"" was caught in the act. It said the circumstances were being investigated.
Local police in Juiz de Fora confirmed to Reuters that the suspect, Adelio Bispo de Oliveira, 40, was in custody and that he appeared to be mentally disturbed. 
Oliveira was affiliated with the leftwing Socialism and Liberty Party from 2007 to 2014, the party said in a written statement, in which it repudiated the violence.
Police video taken at a precinct and aired by TV Globo showed Oliveira telling police that he had been ordered by God to carry out the attack. 
""We do not know if it was politically motivated,"" said Corporal Vitor Albuquerque, a spokesman for the local police.
TV images showed Bolsonaro being carried on someone's shoulders in the middle of a crushing crowd of cheering supporters on one of the city's main streets when a knife was seen raised above heads just before it plunged into the candidate's body.
The pictures show Bolsonaro screaming in pain, then falling backward into the arms of those around him. It took a few moments for the crowd to realize what occurred, but they quickly rushed the candidate out of the street.
A few people gathered outside the hospital where Bolsonaro was treated Thursday night where the scene was calm.
Bolsonaro's rivals in the race expressed outrage at the attack.
Fernando Haddad, who will likely be the leftist Workers Party presidential candidate, said the stabbing was a ""shame"" and a ""horror.""

President Michel Temer and Bolsonaro's electoral rivals Ciro Gomes, Marina Silva, and Geraldo Alckmin all expressed disdain of the violence.

1666,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 07, 2018 12:01AM ET</span>",Challenges grow for New Zealand PM Ardern as communications minister resigns,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern accepted the resignation of her communications minister on Friday only hours after saying her job was safe, capping off a tough month for the popular premier since her return from maternity leave. 
The resignation of Clare Curran, the standing down of another minister last month while a staffing matter was investigated, and a sharp fall in business confidence have raised questions about the effectiveness of the center-left coalition government.
Ardern said in an emailed statement Curran had contacted her on Thursday night to offer her resignation for failing to declare a meeting with a candidate for a top government job.
""I agree with her assessment that resigning is the best course of action for the government and for her,"" Ardern said.
Ardern said in a radio interview earlier on Friday Curran's job was safe but later told reporters that comment was in response to a question about whether she had asked Curran to resign, which she said she had not. She then defended her government's stability.
""Absolutely. No question,"" she said.
""Ultimately what we have here is an error of judgment from a politician ... These things do happen in office,"" Ardern said.
Curran had already stepped down as open government and digital services minister on Aug. 24 for failing to properly declare a meeting with a candidate for the job of the government's chief technology officer. She had retained her more junior communications and broadcasting portfolio.
Curran was also questioned by opposition MPs this week over whether she had used her personal email account for government business.
""I have come to the conclusion the current heat being placed on me is unlikely to go away. This pressure has become intolerable. For the benefit of the government, and my personal well-being, I believe that resignation is the best course of action,"" Curran said in an emailed statement on Friday.
Curran will continue to represent Ardern's Labour Party in parliament, so the government's number of seats is not affected. She is the first minister to resign since the Ardern's coalition took office in late 2017.

1668,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 10:30PM ET</span>",U.N. says six ex-rebel leaders have left Colombia reintegration zones,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - The United Nations mission charged with overseeing Colombia's peace accord with former FARC rebels said on Thursday that six ex-guerrilla commanders were failing to fulfill their obligations under the deal and had left reintegration camps.
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) signed an accord in late 2016 to end more than 52 years of war with the government. It is now a political party that uses the same acronym.
The UN Verification Mission is charged with managing two dozen zones around the country where former fighters can live and take part in reintegration projects. 
Most fighters were given amnesty and financial help under the deal, but commanders are expected to be tried at a special tribunal for alleged war crimes and human rights violations and to serve alternative sentences if convicted.
In recent weeks, six former commanders in the country's southeast ""took the decision to leave the zones and abandon their responsibilities to approximately 1,500 ex-combatants who live there,"" the UN said in a statement.
""Despite the leaders' departure, the ex-combatants and their families continue to live, study and work there, committed to the reincorporation process,"" it added. ""Independent of what motivated the ex-commanders to take this decision, they are failing to fulfill their obligation.""
The six missing commanders include Hernan Dario Velasquez, known as by his nom de guerre El Paisa, and Henry Castellanos, known as Romana, a source who works at an organization that closely follows the peace process said.
Velasquez was convicted in absentia for ordering the 2003 bombing of an upscale club in Bogota that killed 36 people. Castellanos is alleged to have been involved in drug trafficking and well-known kidnappings during his time in the FARC.
The other commanders' noms de guerre are Ivan Ali, Albeiro Cordoba, Enrique Marulanda and El Zarco Aldinever, the source said.
The FARC political party did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
A spokeswoman for the government high peace commission said it had no comment yet.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - An intense wildfire roared unchecked for a second day on Thursday through drought-desiccated timber in Northern California's Shasta-Trinity National Forest, threatening scores of homes and forcing the closure of an interstate highway after motorists had to flee their vehicles.
The Delta fire erupted on Wednesday in a canyon along the Sacramento River about 250 miles north of San Francisco and by Thursday morning had scorched more than 15,000 acres, triple the area that had burned some 12 hours earlier.
The blaze was near where the deadly Carr fire incinerated hundreds of dwellings in and around the town of Redding this summer. That fire claimed eight lives and became one of California's most destructive wildfires on record.
No casualties have been reported from the Delta fire but there were some close calls.
On Wednesday, the blaze raced across the Interstate-5 highway, forcing motorists to flee on foot before flames engulfed their cars and trucks, said Brandon Vaccaro, a spokesman for the Delta fire command team.
Vaccaro said a 45-mile stretch of the key north-south route that runs the length of California remained closed in both directions, requiring motorists headed to Redding from the north to go 120 miles out of their way.
Flames posed an immediate threat to roughly 150 homes and other buildings in the sparsely populated region, with about 300 people under mandatory evacuation orders, Vaccaro said. Farther north, an evacuation warning was in effect for the picturesque town of Dunsmuir, advising some 1,600 residents to be ready to flee at a moment's notice.
The blaze has raged with the same extreme intensity seen in several devastating wildfires in recent months.
Fueled by drought-ravaged pine forests thick with dead and dying timber, flames spread quickly, torching entire trees and leaping from tree-top to tree-top while hurling showers of embers into more dried-out vegetation.
""That's extremely difficult to get ahead of,"" Vaccaro told Reuters by phone. 
As of Thursday, firefighters had been unable to achieve any containment of the blaze, Vaccaro said, but it is hoped that a forecast gradual rise in humidity levels will help slow the fire's growth over the next few days.

The Delta fire was one of about 15 blazes burning across California this week. Three times as much ground has burned in California so far this year than at the same point in 2017, which ranks as one of the most destructive seasons on record.

1670,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 09:10PM ET</span>",Pacific leaders seek U.S. return to Paris climate pact,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Pacific island nations declared climate change to be their ""single greatest threat"", urging Washington to return to the Paris Agreement on climate, just as Western powers seek to check China's rising influence in the region. 
Australia, which has backed away from its own commitment to Paris without exiting the pact, was among the 18 nations of the Pacific Islands Forum that made the call at a meeting of leaders on the tiny island state of Nauru.
""Climate change presents the single greatest threat to the livelihood, security and well-being of Pacific people,"" the leaders said in a communique, asking the United States to return to the climate pact.
Tuvalu Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga told a news conference: ""The aspiration is for the U.S. to be in the Paris Agreement again because we cannot have comprehensive robust emission reduction unless the biggest emitter of greenhouse gas is there in the process, we cannot leave the U.S. out.""
However, participants said one country would not agree to even stronger language in the communique and Sopoaga made clear which it was, although he stopped short of naming it.
""The name of the qualifier (started with) alphabetical A, capital A,"" Sopoaga told Wednesday's news conference, held after the leaders' meeting.
No forum member's name, apart from Australia's, begins with the letter 'A'.
Australia's representative at the meeting, Foreign Minister Marise Payne, declined to answer questions about Sopoaga's comments.
""It is not appropriate to discuss the internal talks of the private Leaders' Retreat,"" Payne said in an emailed statement.
""Australia understands the importance that Pacific Countries place on effective global action to combat climate change,"" she said.
The demand for action over the low-lying islands of the Pacific, seen as the front line of global climate change, comes as rising sea levels and other climate-related crises force residents to move to higher ground.
Against this backdrop, China's vocal support for tackling global warming aids its drive to win allies and influence in the strategically significant and resource-rich area.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement in 2017, saying it favored other countries and put the United States at a disadvantage.
Climate change is domestic political dynamite in Australia, one of the world's largest coal exporters which has also sought to push back against China's influence in the Pacific.
Wednesday's communique endorsed ""with qualification"" a separate, stronger statement from seven small Pacific Island states seeking ""urgent resolution"" of Paris rules to cap the rise in global temperatures at 1.5 degrees Celsius. 
""If that cap is not reached, there are going to be serious problems on islands like Tuvalu,"" Sopoaga said, citing an estimate of island submergence by 2030 from the U.S. Geological Survey.

""2030 is not far away, our grandchildren would still be growing up and the islands of Tuvalu and Kiribati and, maybe, part of Nauru would be submerged,"" he said.

1671,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 09:05PM ET</span>",U.S. should suspend military aid to Uganda: lawyer for critic of Museveni,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States should suspend military aid to Uganda over the government's human rights record, the U.S. lawyer for a prominent critic of President Yoweri Museveni said on Thursday.
The call broadened criticism of the government by opposition lawmaker Robert Kyagulanyi, a musician known by his stage name Bobi Wine. 
Authorities charged Kyagulanyi with treason last month over the suspected stoning of Museveni's convoy. He denies the charge and says he was tortured in detention. He arrived in Washington on Saturday for medical treatment for his injuries.
A State Department official said Kyagulanyi met with representatives from the department on Thursday, ""as they have done in the past when he visited the United States.""
Undersecretary of State for African Affairs Tibor Nagy did not participate in the meeting at the State Department.
There was no immediate comment from the government in Kampala. 
Kyagulanyi has gained popularity for his attacks on Museveni. The president has ruled since 1986 and has won a series of elections, but is viewed by some as out of touch. The government in Kampala denies torturing Kyagulanyi.
""We want the American taxpayer to know that the American taxpayer is funding this. The military equipment we are supplying to Uganda is being used in a war of terror against Uganda's citizens,"" lawyer Robert Amsterdam, flanked by Kyagulanyi, told a news conference in Washington 
""We call on the U.S. government to immediately suspend military funding to Uganda,"" he said.
Kyagulanyi, 36, used crutches and showed reporters blisters on the palm of his hand he said were traces of the torture.
""I must go back home. Uganda is my home,"" he said. ""I want you (my supporters) to stand with the oppressed, not the oppressor.""
Washington is a major source of funding for Uganda's military, supplying hardware, cash and training. It has given equipment, money and intelligence for the military's hunt for Lord's Resistance Army warlord Joseph Kony.
Museveni also receives diplomatic support from Washington for his deployment of troops in international peacekeeping missions including the fight against militants in Somalia.
Chinese offshore oil and gas company CNOOC Ltd, France's  Total  SA (PA:TOTF) and London-listed  Tullow Oil  Plc (LON:TLW) are among major investors in Uganda. [L5N1VS2S9]

1672,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 09:00PM ET</span>","U.S. hotels arm staff with panic buttons, after years of resistance","By Makini Brice and Chris Kirkham
(Reuters) - Major hotel chains including Marriott International Inc (O:MAR) and  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc (N:HLT) said on Thursday they are arming U.S. employees with panic buttons to fight sexual harassment and crime, an about-face for an industry that has opposed the idea for years. 
Workers in the hotel industry are frequent targets of sexual harassment as they are often alone with guests in their rooms. Unions and other advocates have increased pressure on hotels to provide the devices over the last year in the wake of the #MeToo social media movement and the Oct. 1 Las Vegas shooting, where the gunman opened fire from his hotel window.
""Protecting our employees and the millions of guests who stay in our hotels each day is of paramount importance to the industry,"" Katherine Lugar, president and chief executive of the American Hotel and Lodging Association, told reporters at an industry event in Washington.
The devices would likely cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and affect tens of thousands of workers in a rollout expected to occur over the next few years, she said.
Executives at Marriott and Hilton pledged to roll out the devices to employees across all of their U.S. hotels by 2020. 
Executives from InterContinental Hotels Group Plc (L:IHG), and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts Inc (N:WH) said they are working on plans to roll out the devices to their owned and managed hotels over the next two years, and are working on guidelines for franchise owners.  Hyatt Hotels Corp  (N:H) said it has the devices at 120 Hyatt hotels in North and South America and plans to make them standard across all managed and franchised hotels.
Brands for those five companies comprise 45 percent of all hotel rooms in the United States, according to STR Inc, which tracks the hotel industry.
The hotel and restaurant industry accounted for more than 14 percent of sexual harassment complaints filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission between 2005 and 2015, the highest of any industry, according to an analysis last year by the left-leaning Center for American Progress. 
Earlier this year, a group of female Marriott workers demanded at the company's annual meeting better protection from sexual harassment, including panic buttons.
D. Taylor, president of hospitality workers' union Unite Here, which has spearheaded many of the efforts on panic buttons, praised what he called ""a long overdue first step"" by the hotel industry. 
He added that he hopes the industry will invest in the proper technology to ensure workers' safety.
""You have to invest not just in words, but in capital, to make sure your workforce is safe,"" Taylor said.
Hospitality workers' unions have succeeded in requiring the devices in a handful of U.S. cities in recent years, including Washington, D.C., Seattle, Chicago, Las Vegas and Miami Beach, Florida. 
Unionized hotel workers in New York City have had similar devices since 2012, in the wake of a hotel housekeeper’s charge that she was sexually assaulted by former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn in a New York hotel in 2011.
Dallamy Santos has worked for nearly two decades as a housekeeper and porter at a Las Vegas casino resort. 
A few years ago she was cleaning a male guest's room when he offered her money for sex, she said. On another occasion a male guest left a pornographic film on the TV and made her feel uncomfortable. In both cases she said she ran out of the room, not knowing what else to do.
""In those moments you don't feel safe; you don't see that person any more as a guest,"" Santos said. ""You don't want to have to worry about where you're going to get the help."" 
Marriott's Chief Executive Arne Sorenson at Thursday's event held up a device that resembled a thin black box with a red button. He said it usually includes a GPS system to signal security or hotel management. Others at the event said there were options for the devices to sound a loud noise.

A 2016 survey of nearly 500 Chicago-area female hospitality workers found that 58 percent in the hotel industry and 77 percent in the casino industry had experienced sexual harassment by guests, according to the study by industry union Unite Here. Common complaints included guests exposing themselves to housekeepers or cornering them in the room.

(Reuters) - Special Counsel Robert Mueller wants President Donald Trump to commit to a follow-up interview to written answers to questions in his probe of any coordination between Trump campaign members and Russia in the 2016 U.S. election, Rudy Giuliani, who is representing the president, said on Thursday.
Giuliani, who said talks between the two sides were continuing, saw Mueller's stance as a hardening in the position prosecutors are taking after offering to allow Trump to answer questions in writing.
""I thought we were close to having an agreement until they came back with, 'You have to agree now that you'll allow a follow-up,' and I don’t see how we can do it,"" Giuliani told Reuters.
Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment.
Lawyers for Trump have been negotiating over a potential interview with Mueller's team since last year in the U.S. investigation of Russian meddling in the presidential election, which Moscow denies. Trump has denied any campaign collusion, calling the Mueller probe a ""witch hunt.""
In a letter to Trump's lawyers last week, Mueller expressed a willingness to accept written responses on questions about collusion, but did not rule out a possible interview as a follow-up, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
After receiving the written responses, Mueller's investigators would decide on a next step, which could include an interview with Trump, the person said. 
But Giuliani said on Thursday that Mueller's team had stiffened its position in the latest talks.
""They want a commitment"" to a follow-up interview, Giuliani said. ""We've said no, and let's see how they deal with it.""
Giuliani has described a possible interview with Mueller as a potential ""perjury trap,"" an opportunity to catch Trump making a false statement under oath, and legal experts have also suggested that Trump could open himself up to trouble.
Mueller is also investigating whether Trump may have tried to obstruct the Russia investigation after winning office, but Giuliani said on Thursday that no questions on the obstruction issue would be part of the first round of questions.
If negotiations break down with Mueller, a subpoena could be issued for Trump to testify before a grand jury, which Giuliani has said they would fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the campaign, seeking to tilt it in Trump's favor against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by hacking Democratic computer networks and spreading disinformation on social media.

1674,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 08:17PM ET</span>",U.S. has seen evidence of Syria preparing chemical weapons in Idlib: envoy,"By Lesley Wroughton
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - There is ""lots of evidence"" that chemical weapons are being prepared by Syrian government forces in Idlib in northwest Syria, the new U.S. adviser for Syria said on Thursday, as he warned of the risks of an offensive on the country's last big rebel enclave.
""I am very sure that we have very, very good grounds to be making these warnings,"" said Jim Jeffrey, who was named on Aug. 17 as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's special adviser on Syria overseeing talks on a political transition in that country.
""Any offensive is to us objectionable as a reckless escalation,"" Jeffrey told a few reporters in his first interview on the situation in Syria since his appointment. ""There is lots of evidence that chemical weapons are being prepared.""
The White House has warned that the United States and its allies would respond ""swiftly and vigorously"" if government forces used chemical weapons in the widely expected offensive.
Jeffrey said an attack by Russian and Syrian forces, and the use of chemical weapons, would force huge refugee flows into southeastern Turkey or areas in Syria under Turkish control.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has massed his army and allied forces on the frontlines in the northwest, and Russian planes have joined his bombardment of rebels there, in a prelude to a possible assault.
The fate of the insurgent stronghold in and around Idlib province rests on a meeting to be held in Tehran on Friday between the leaders of Assad's supporters Russia and Iran, and the rebels' ally, Turkey.
""We will find out to some degree tomorrow if the Russians are willing to come to a compromise with the Turks,"" Jeffrey said.
Backed by Russian air power, Assad has in recent years taken back one rebel enclave after another. Idlib and its surroundings are now the only significant area where armed opposition to Damascus remains.
Jeffrey described the situation in Idlib as ""very dangerous"" and said Turkey was trying to avoid an all-out Syrian government offensive.
""I think the last chapter of the Idlib story has not been written. The Turks are trying to find a way out. The Turks have shown a great deal of resistance to an attack,"" he said.
He said the United States had repeatedly asked Russia whether it could ""operate"" in Idlib to eliminate the last holdouts of Islamic State and other extremist groups. Asked whether that would include U.S. air strikes, Jeffrey said: ""That would be one way.""
There was periodic cooperation between the United States and Russia against the same jihadist groups operating in Idlib until mid-2017.
DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVE
As sides close in on the remaining jihadist forces operating in Syria, Jeffrey said it was time for a ""major diplomatic initiative"" to end the seven-year conflict.
There was a ""a new commitment"" by the administration to remain in Syria until Islamic State militants were defeated, while ensuring Iran left the country, he added.
While President Donald Trump had signaled that he wanted U.S. forces out of Syria, in April he agreed to keep troops there a little longer.
Trump will chair a U.N. Security Council meeting on Iran during an annual gathering of world leaders in New York later this month. The meeting will focus on Iran's nuclear program and its meddling in the wars in Syria and Yemen.
France has invited the United States, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Germany and Britain for talks on the sidelines of the U.N. meeting to discuss Syria, Jeffrey said.
He said Assad ""has no future as a ruler"" in Syria, but it was not up to Washington to get rid of him and it would work with Moscow on a political transition.

""Right now (the Syrian government) is a cadaver sitting in rubble with just half the territory of Syria under regime control on a good day,"" Jeffrey said.

On Wednesday, authorities investigating the crash said it was likely caused by bad weather.
Still, in a letter sent to workers of Aeromexico, Chief Executive Andres Conesa said the three pilots on the flight had already left the company.

Just 14 percent of Britons identified themselves as Church of England, down from 31 percent 15 years ago, the British Social Attitudes survey found. The number saying they had no religion rose from 41 to 52 percent.
Church of Scotland numbers also fell from 31 percent in 2002 to 18 percent. 
""Our figures show an unrelenting decline in Church of England and Church of Scotland numbers,"" said Roger Harding, Head of Public Attitudes at the National Centre for Social Research.
""This is especially true for young people where less than one in 20 now belong to their established church. While the figures are starkest among younger people, in every age group the biggest single group are those identifying with no religion."" 
The sharpest decline in those saying they were Church of England was among 45 to 54-year-olds while 70 percent of those aged between 18 and 24 said they had no religion, according to the survey, based on 3,988 interviews.
However, the research found that the number of Britons who described themselves as Roman Catholic (8 percent), of 'other Christian affiliations' (10 percent), and non-Christian faiths (8 percent) had remained fairly stable.

Roman Catholics also went to church more regularly, with 42 percent attending at least once a month compared to 21 percent of Church of England members.

Paraguay on Wednesday dealt a blow to Israeli's quest for recognition of Jerusalem as its capital, which appeared to have gained some traction this year when the United States, followed by Guatemala and Paraguay, relocated embassies there.
Most countries do not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the entire city.
Pence, who played a main role in President Donald Trump's decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, spoke on Wednesday to Paraguayan President Mario Abdo, who was elected on Aug. 15.
Pence ""strongly encouraged"" Abdo to follow through with Paraguay's commitment to move the embassy to Jerusalem ""as a sign of the historic relationship the country has maintained with both Israel and the United States,"" Pence's office said in a statement.
Former Paraguay President Horacio Cartes opened the new embassy in Jerusalem on May 21, just days after the United States and Guatemala did. 
Hours after Paraguay announced its change on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded by ordering the closure of Israel's embassy in Paraguay.
The statement from Pence's office did not say how Abdo responded to the vice president's request.
It said only that Abdo ""underscored Paraguay's lasting partnership with Israel and the leaders agreed to work towards achieving a comprehensive and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.""
Abdo on Wednesday defended his decision as part of an effort to support ""broad, lasting and just peace"" among Israelis and Palestinians.
Trump reversed decades of U.S. Middle East policy. The status of Jerusalem - home to sites holy to the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions - is one of the thorniest obstacles to forging a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians.
Israel claims as its capital all of the city, including the eastern sector that it annexed after the 1967 war in a move not recognized internationally.
But the Palestinians want East Jerusalem for the capital of a future state they hope to establish in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Negotiations between the two sides broke down in 2014.

Australia will add two AP-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft to conduct maritime surveillance to an existing aircraft deployed earlier in the year, Defence Minister Christopher Pyne said in a statement. 
New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters said his government was deploying an Air Force P-3K2 plane to carry out patrols of international waters in North Asia for signs of vessels undertaking activities that break U.N. sanctions against North Korea, including ship-to-ship transfers.
""We welcome the recent dialogue North Korea has had with the United States and South Korea. However, until such time as North Korea abides by its international obligations, full implementation of the United Nations Security Council sanctions resolutions will be essential,"" Peters said.
The aircraft would be based at Kadena Air Base in Japan, he added.
The United States has been pressuring North Korea via sanctions to give up its nuclear weapons program and in August penalized two Russian shipping companies and six vessels it said were involved in the transfer of refined petroleum products to North Korean vessels in violation of UN restrictions.
The United States and North Korea are involved in talks intended to ease tensions between them, and U.S. President Donald Trump met with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un in June.
Since then relations have cooled and a planned visit by the top U.S. diplomat to North Korea was scrapped last week because Trump said insufficient progress toward denuclearization had been made.

The move by Australia was a ""continuation"" of the country's ""strong stand to deter and disrupt illicit trade and sanctions evasion activities by North Korea and its associated networks,"" Pyne said.

The mortars landed on an ""abandoned lot,"" resulting in ""no casualties or physical damage,"" the statement said. 
A security source inside the Green Zone said the mortars landed near the Egyptian embassy. 
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which comes after days of intensifying protests in Iraq's southern oil hub city of Basra.
Hundreds of protesters, angry over the neglect of their city's collapsing infrastructure, took to the streets for a fourth day on Thursday, setting fire to political party offices and government buildings.
The mortar attack is the first such one in several years on the Green Zone, which houses parliament, government buildings and many foreign embassies.
In May 2016, three mortars landed near the Green Zone. Anti-corruption protesters, led by populist Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, breached the Green Zone twice that year, storming parliament and the cabinet office.
Sadr is now vying to form Iraq's ruling coalition in an alliance with incumbent Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, his electoral bloc having come first in May's national election.
The Green Zone was regularly targeted by mortars during the U.S. occupation of Iraq that ended in 2011.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York's attorney general issued civil subpoenas on Thursday to all eight Roman Catholic dioceses in the state as part of a sex abuse investigation, a law enforcement source said.
The subpoenas are part of an ongoing civil investigation by Attorney General Barbara Underwood's office into how dioceses reviewed and may have covered up allegations of sexual abuse of minors, said the source, who asked not to be identified.
In August, Underwood sought to partner with district attorneys, the only entities with the power to convene grand juries in the state, to investigate possible crimes.
There is no time limit under New York state's statute of limitations for so-called Class A felonies such as rape.
""The Pennsylvania grand jury report shined a light on incredibly disturbing and depraved acts by Catholic clergy, assisted by a culture of secrecy and cover ups in the dioceses,"" Underwood said in a statement on Thursday, announcing New York's investigation.
The Archdiocese of New York said in a statement it had received the subpoena and was eager to work with Underwood in the investigation. It said that since 2002, it has shared information with the office concerning allegations of sexual abuse of minors.
""Not only do we provide any information they seek, they also notify us as well when they learn of an allegation of abuse, so that, even if they cannot bring criminal charges, we might investigate and remove from ministry any cleric who has a credible and substantiated allegation of abuse,"" said Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York.
The Diocese of Buffalo said in a statement that it would cooperate with any investigation by the New York State attorney general or district attorney.
New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said on Thursday that his office was creating a task force to investigate allegations of sexual abuse by clergy members within the state's Catholic dioceses.
Last month of a grand jury report on a two-year investigation into abuse in Pennsylvania said that at least 1,000 people, mostly children, had been sexually abused by some 300 clergymen over the past 70 years.

Grewal said he was troubled by that report. ""We owe it to the people of New Jersey to find out whether the same thing happened here,"" he said in a statement. ""If it did, we will take action against those responsible.""

State attorney general Jorge Winckler told a news conference that investigators discovered the bodies in 32 graves in the central part of the state after an Aug. 8 tip from an unidentified person that they had been dumped there.
Veracruz has long been wracked by violent crime, and is an important trafficking route for drug gangs moving narcotics north toward the U.S. border.
Winckler did not reveal the precise location of the graves.
Analysis of the remains indicated the bodies had probably not been there for more than two years, he said.
In March 2017, Winckler announced the discovery of more than 250 skulls in unmarked graves in the state.

Yukiya Amano, a 71-year-old Japanese diplomat, was last year reappointed to a third four-year term in charge of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Its responsibilities include policing restrictions placed on Iran's nuclear activities under the country's 2015 deal with world powers.
Amano ""has undergone a medical procedure outside Austria. The procedure was successful and he is making steady progress toward full recovery,"" the IAEA said in a statement.
The IAEA did not say where Amano had been treated or what he had been treated for.
""Director General Amano continues to discharge his responsibilities, supervising and guiding the work of the agency in close communication with his office,"" the IAEA said. 
""He is also overseeing the preparations and provides guidance to senior IAEA staff for these meetings. He is expected to return to Vienna in early October."".
Amano's treatment comes at a sensitive time, since the U.S. announced its withdrawal from the Iran accord in May and the reimposition of sanctions that were lifted under that agreement. Some of those have already taken effect and others are due to come into force in November.
Despite efforts by European powers to shield companies and protect Iranian oil revenues and other sources of income, many diplomats and analysts believe the deal could soon fall apart, prompting Iran to ramp up atomic activities beyond caps imposed under the accord.
Amano will also miss one of the busiest periods of the year for his agency. In addition to a quarterly meeting of its 35-nation Board of Governors next week, it is due to hold an annual meeting of all its member states the following week.
Amano's absence also follows the sudden resignation in May of the head of the IAEA department in charge of inspections, one of its most sensitive activities.

The IAEA said earlier on Thursday that the news conference Amano normally holds on the first day of the Board of Governors meeting would not take place. It did not say why.

British prosecutors on Wednesday charged two Russian nationals with the attack on the Skripals in the English city of Salisbury using the nerve agent Novichok.
Later, Prime Minister Theresa May said the men were officers in Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, acting on orders from senior Kremlin figures, accusations Moscow has rejected as unacceptable.
In a speech in Washington on Thursday, Jeremy Fleming, Director of the GCHQ eavesdropping intelligence agency, said his staff had helped the ""painstaking and highly complex investigation"" into identifying those responsible for the Salisbury poisonings and action would now be taken. 
""We have ascertained exactly who was responsible and the methods they used,"" Fleming told the Billington Cyber Security Conference according to extracts released by his office.
""The threat from Russia is real. It’s active and it will be countered by a strong international partnership of allies, able to deploy the full range of tools from across our national security apparatus, and ready to reject the Kremlin's brazen determination to undermine the international rules based order.""

ASUNCION (Reuters) - Turkey will open an embassy in Asuncion, Paraguay, the South American country said on Thursday, a day after President Mario Abdo reversed the previous administration's decision to move its diplomatic mission in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. 
Turkey's ambassador to Paraguay has been operating out of Buenos Aires. Turkey has a consulate in Asuncion and another in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay.
By opening the embassy, Turkey is expressing support for Paraguay's stance on Israel, Paraguay's Foreign Minister Luis Castiglioni told reporters.
Paraguay and Guatemala relocated their embassies in Israel to Jerusalem after U.S. President Donald Trump recognized the city as the country's capital in December. Hours after Paraguay's new government announced on Wednesday it would move its embassy back to Tel Aviv from Jerusalem, Israel responded by ordering the closure of its embassy in Paraguay.
Most countries do not recognize Israeli sovereignty over the whole of Jerusalem, arguing that peace talks should determine the city's final status. Paraguay cited this as one reason to move its embassy back to Tel Aviv.
Castiglioni said he expected to meet his Turkish counterpart at the United Nations General Assembly in New York this month.
Paraguay considers Israel's decision to close its embassy hasty and disproportionate, and hopes Israeli authorities will reconsider, Castiglioni said.

BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Hundreds of people took to the streets of Iraq's southern oil city Basra for a fourth day of violent protests on Thursday, where residents, angry over the neglect of their city's collapsing infrastructure, set fire to political offices.
Eight demonstrators have been killed in clashes with security forces and dozens injured since a wave of protests began on Monday. Tens of security forces members have also been injured, some by a hand grenade, local health and security officials said.
Protesters on Thursday targeted several provincial government buildings, setting the headquarters of the local government on fire, and blocked main roads in the city center. 
A protester died on Thursday night from burns sustained during the torching of the government headquarters, health and security sources said. 
People attacked the offices of the state-run Iraqiya TV and set fire to the headquarters of the ruling Dawa Party, the Supreme Islamic Council and the Badr Organization, whose leaders are all vying to form Iraq's ruling coalition.
Protesters also set fire to the offices of a powerful Shi'ite Muslim militia, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, and those of the Hikma Movement about 100 km (60 miles) north of Basra, and stormed the house of the acting head of the provincial council.
The provincial government headquarters was engulfed in flames, local police and military sources said. However, no protesters were near the building when the fire broke out in the afternoon, they said.
Security forces, including members of the rapid response team, were expected to be patrolling in high numbers on Thursday. By nightfall, however, they were few and far between in the city center and were not interfering heavily in protesters' activities.
Basra security officials announced a curfew from 10:30 p.m. (1930 GMT) to help quell the protests. A city-wide curfew was originally planned for 3 p.m., but was canceled minutes before it was due to come into force. 
An Iraqi security official in Basra said they were struggling to cope with the demonstrations. ""We are still waiting for orders from the state's highest authorities,"" he said. 
The port of Umm Qasr, the country's main seaport and its principle lifeline for grain and other commodity imports, closed on Thursday. Port employees said all operations had ceased after protesters began blocking the entrance, which lies about 60 km from Basra, on Wednesday night. Trucks and staff were unable to get in or out of the complex. 
Oil exports, handled at offshore terminals, remained untouched by the unrest. Oil exports from Basra account for more than 95 percent of Iraqi state revenues.
RAGE 
Southern Iraq, heartland of the Shi'ite majority, first erupted in unrest in July as protesters expressed rage over collapsing infrastructure, power cuts and corruption.
Residents in Basra, a city of more than 2 million people, say the water supply has become contaminated with salt. 
A Health Ministry spokesman told a news conference in Baghdad that 6,280 people had been recently hospitalized with diarrhea due to the oversalinated water.
Public anger has grown at a time when politicians are struggling to form a government after an inconclusive parliamentary election in May. Residents of the south complain of decades of neglect in the region that produces the bulk of Iraq's oil wealth.
Leading political figures, embroiled in government formation negotiations in Baghdad, have scrambled to respond to the crisis, condemning rivals for inaction.
Moqtada al-Sadr, a populist Shi'ite cleric whose electoral bloc came first in May's election, called for an emergency televised session of parliament to discuss ""radical"" solutions to the crisis in Basra, a city ""without water, electricity or dignity"". 
Iraq's second biggest city, Basra is a stronghold of Sadr who has recast himself as an anti-corruption campaigner and has allied himself with incumbent Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. 
The prime minister responded that he would be ready to attend a meeting of parliament with the ministers and officials concerned to try to find a resolution. 
Abadi has ordered the Interior Ministry to conduct an investigation into the protests and to instruct security forces not to use live ammunition.
Parliament convened for the first time on Monday, but failed to elect a speaker as mandated, delaying its next meeting to Sept. 15.

The Basra head of Iraq's Commission for Human Rights, Mahdi al-Tamimi, called for an investigation into the deaths of protesters, saying most had been shot.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's nephew was sentenced on Thursday to six months in U.S. prison for a bribery scheme that he thought would result in the sale of a Vietnamese building complex to a Qatari sovereign wealth fund, federal prosecutors said.
Joo Hyun ""Dennis"" Bahn, a South Korean citizen living in the United States, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos in Manhattan. He had pleaded guilty in January to conspiracy and violating a U.S. foreign corruption law.
A lawyer for Bahn could not immediately be reached for comment.
In his guilty plea, Bahn admitted that in 2014 and 2015, he tried to arrange a bribe to secure the sale of Hanoi's Landmark 72 building complex, owned by Korean construction company Keangnam Enterprises Co Ltd. Bahn's father, Ban Ki-sang, was an executive at the company.
Bahn said he believed he was paying a $500,000 bribe to an official at Qatar's sovereign wealth fund through a middleman, New York fashion designer and blogger Malcolm Harris. In reality, Bahn said, Harris had no connection with any Qatari official and kept the money.
U.S. prosecutors have also charged Ban Ki-sang, who remains at large. Prosecutors have said he enlisted his son to arrange the Landmark 72 sale to help Keangnam deal with a liquidity crisis.
Ban Ki-moon was long expected to make a bid for the presidency of South Korea but announced in February 2017 that he would not run, decrying ""fake news"" about him and his family.
Bahn's lawyers said in a court filing last month that Bahn did not have a close relationship with his uncle.

Harris pleaded guilty to money laundering and wire fraud in June and was sentenced to 3-1/2 years in prison in October.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala's Foreign Minister said on Thursday that United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres should not interfere with the country's decision to bar an anti-corruption prosecutor.
""Mister secretary-general, you are at the service of the member states, it is unacceptable and against the purpose of the United Nations to try to be a supranational entity,"" Foreign Minister Sandra Jovel said.
Earlier this week, Guatemalan authorities barred Commissioner Ivan Velasquez of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) from entering the country. 
An independent international entity, the CICIG was established in 2007 to investigate criminal groups in Guatemala, and it can conduct independent investigations, act in conjunction with the country's prosecutors and make public policy recommendations to help fight criminal groups.
CICIG's mandate is renewed by the Guatemalan government every two years, but its head is appointed by the United Nations. 
Guterres said through a spokesman on Wednesday that the U.N. Secretariat had serious concerns about the decision, adding that it did not appear to be consistent with the agreement on the establishment of Commission.
Jovel said on Thursday that the International Commission Against Impunity had meddled in Guatemala's affairs, pressured Congress to change laws and violated the presumption of innocence.
A representative for the CICIG did not respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this week, Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales said the country had barred Ivan Velasquez, head of the CICIG, from entry and asked the U.N. to send a replacement.
Guterres said on Wednesday that Velasquez would continue to run CICIG from outside Guatemala. 
Morales has been in a dispute with Velasquez, who has tried to impeach the president for corruption and has targeted members of his family over suspected graft. 
Morales has denied any wrongdoing and said on Thursday the decision to bar Velasquez was not taken for personal reasons.
The United Nations is facing pushback elsewhere in Central America.
Nicaragua's government ordered the expulsion of a United Nations human rights delegation soon after it released a report condemning repression and abuses by the government.

At a Wednesday U.N. meeting, Nicaragua rejected an argument by the United States that recent unrest could threaten regional security.

(Reuters) - A gunman opened fire inside a bank in downtown Cincinnati on Thursday morning, killing three people and wounding others before being shot and killed by police, authorities said.
The shooter began firing inside a loading dock at the Fifth Third Bank headquarters near Fountain Square (NYSE:SQ), police said. He then entered the lobby where he exchanged fire with law enforcement.
""He was actively shooting innocent victims, it appears, and our officers were able to kill him and stop the threat very quickly,"" Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley told a news conference.
The city's police chief, Eliot Isaac, said he could not confirm local media reports that the gunman was a disgruntled employee of the bank, and said he had no information the victims were targeted. No police officers were hurt, Isaac said.
Witnesses said more than a dozen shots were fired.
Ebony Ginyard, who works at a Dunkin' Donuts in Fountain Square, said she and other workers and customers dropped to the floor when the shooting started. She said the gunman was so close that she could smell the gunpowder as he fired.
""All he had to is look over the counter at us and we would have been shot,"" Ginyard told reporters. 
Another onlooker, Leonard Cain, told a newspaper he had been about to enter the bank when someone warned him about the shooting. Cain said he then saw a woman also walking into the bank and that people tried to get her attention, but she was wearing headphones and did not hear them.
""She walked in the door and he shot her,"" Cain told The Cincinnati Enquirer, adding that he heard up to 15 shots.
The Enquirer said some customers hid inside a bathroom at the bank, and that one gunshot victim was found inside a nearby ice cream shop.
Another witness, Michael Richardson, who works in the Fifth Third Bank building, told the newspaper he was outside smoking a cigarette when he heard gunshots.
""I looked behind me and saw the guy – he shot and then he shot again. After that I started running,"" he said.
Isaac told reporters the gunman's weapon was recovered, but did not say what type of firearm he used. The police chief said he could not say whether the gunman was hit by gunfire from ""at least three or four"" police officers. 
In a statement, Fifth Third Bank said its thoughts and prayers were with everyone caught up the ""terrible event.""
The area around the 30-story skyscraper was closed to pedestrians after the shooting, and hours later several streets in downtown Cincinnati remained closed to traffic.
The mayor told reporters the situation was not normal and should not be viewed as such, adding that the United States is the only industrialized nation with frequent active shooting incidents.
""We as a country have to deal with it,"" Cranley added.
U.S. Senator Rob Portman said he and wife Janet were heartbroken about the shooting in their hometown.
City councilman P.G. Sittenfeld said on Twitter that every city has its sacred spaces, and for Cincinnati that was Fountain Square, ""a place of joy and protest and coming together.""

""The actions of one sick man doesn't change that. That's not what our city is,"" Sittenfeld wrote on Twitter. ""I will be eating lunch on Fountain Square tomorrow, mindful of the true character of Cincinnati.""

The so-called ""bribe destroyer"" or ""spazzacorrotti"" bill is a brainchild of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which took office after campaigning against the rampant corruption that has characterized Italian politics in the past. 
Five-star has governed in a coalition with the far-right League party since June. 
Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, who is also 5-Star leader, told reporters the bill would save the state ""billions"" of euros. He did not specify how that figure had been calculated.
Justice Minister Alfonso Bonafede, also 5-Star member, hailed the bill as a ""revolution in the fight against corruption,"" after the cabinet approved it.
""This is the first in a series of measures that should make the country competitive again,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said. 
The bill now goes to parliament. The coalition has a majority in both houses, but Italian legislation is often amended by deputies before becoming law.
Under the government's draft, anyone convicted of corruption and sentenced to more than two years in prison will never be able to hold public office or seek a state contract again, Bonafede said.
Those convicted of corruption crimes carrying sentences of less than two years will be shut out of public business for five to seven years, he said.
The legislation would also allow undercover agents to work on corruption investigations for the first time. 
Another component of the bill is that it will require full transparency on private and corporate contributions to political parties and foundations, Di Maio said.

""This will allow us to finally understand why over the years we've seen some policy choices made that went against the interests of citizens,"" he said.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Facing a steep rise in costs as the lira crashed and the price of imported paper soared, satirical magazine LeMan bucked the trend in Turkish media last week and left its cover price unchanged. 
Instead it went to print a quarter of its usual size.
The edition was so popular that it went to press twice. This week, LeMan doubled its size, getting halfway back to the look of the original magazine.
""We found some more paper,"" it said on the front page. ""We expanded with your support."" A small victory-hand emoji stood next to the message.
The slump in the lira has driven up the cost of imported materials, raising concerns about the broader economy and hitting some industries particularly hard. Publishing costs have risen 80 percent, according to the head of Turkey's publishers' union, Kenan Kocaturk.
""The (increase) will have around a 25-40 percent impact on our prices for readers,"" he told a Turkish opposition television channel this week, adding a further weakening of the lira would drive costs even higher.
Turkey has imported paper since its only paper mill closed a decade ago, leaving publishers vulnerable to currency fluctuations such as the lira's 42 percent fall against the U.S. dollar so far this year. 
Inflation is also on the rise, hitting 17.9 percent year-on-year in August, its highest level since late 2003.
LeMan took on the inflation as a ""humorous challenge,"" said Editor-in-Chief Tuncay Akgun, describing conditions as excruciating.
""Even if you can come up with the money, paper suppliers are not eager to take the papers out of storage because it is not clear what the price will be in two hours.""
Akgun said LeMan had reached the stage of possible closure and he could not offer a long-term view of its prospects. ""When I say future, I am talking about next week,"" he said.

""Will the newspapers also shrink in the coming days? Will they fall to pocket size?"" said Meral Ozdemir, a LeMan reader. ""I look at LeMan now and it's a shame. I am really upset because it is so small. Will it dwindle further?""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Thursday charged and sanctioned a North Korean man in the 2017 global WannaCry ransomware cyberattack and the 2014 cyberassault on  Sony  Corp (T:6758) (N:SNE), U.S. officials said. 
The charges, part of a strategy by the U.S. government to deter future cyberattacks by naming and shaming the alleged perpetrators, also alleged that the North Korean hacker broke into the central bank of Bangladesh in 2016, according to a criminal complaint. 
Park Jin Hyok worked as part of a team of hackers, also known as the Lazarus Group, to try to breach multiple other U.S. businesses, according to the complaint. In 2016 and 2017, Park's targets included defense contractor  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT). The complaint said there was no evidence Lockheed was breached.
The U.S. Treasury Department has imposed sanctions against Park and the Chinese-based front company he worked for, Chosun Expo.
The North Korean mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
In 2014, U.S. officials said unnamed North Korean hackers were responsible for a major cyber intrusion into Sony, which resulted in leaked internal documents and data being destroyed. 
The attacks came after Pyongyang sent a letter to the United Nations, demanding that Sony not move forward with the movie ""The Interview"" that portrayed the U.S.-backed assassination of a character made to look like North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Park used a series of online personas for social media platforms, including on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter, to send malicious links to individuals involved in the production of ""The Interview,"" the complaint said. The malicious links carried North Korean-controlled malware. 
In November 2014, Park allegedly launched the same style social media-focused attack against employees of AMC Theatres (N:AMC). The movie theater chain in some cases delayed or canceled screenings of ""The Interview"" nationwide, Variety at the time reported. The complaint said there was no evidence AMC Theatres was breached. 
Last year, the WannaCry ransomware attack affected thousands of businesses across the globe through a computer virus that encrypted files on affected systems, including Britain's National Health Service, where nonfunctional computer systems forced the cancellation of thousands of appointments.
John Demers, the Assistant Attorney General of the National Security Division, said on Thursday that this marks the first time the U.S. Justice Department has formally charged a hacker in connection with cyber crimes ""sponsored"" by the North Korean government.
""The department has charged, arrested and imprisoned hackers working for the governments of China, Russia and Iran. Today, we add the North Korean regime to our list, completing frankly four out of four of our principle adversaries in cyberspace.""
A senior Justice Department official said a criminal investigation into Park and his accomplices was still ongoing. There has been no communication between the U.S. and North Korean government about a possible extradition, the official said. 
No North Korean government officials were referenced in the complaint by name, though it does allege the government sponsored the attacks. 

The complaint was filed under seal on June 8, just days before a historic summit in Singapore between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

CHISINAU (Reuters) - The human rights group Amnesty International criticized a decision by the Moldovan authorities on Thursday to detain and expel a group of Turkish citizens, calling it part of a pattern of reprisals against Turkish nationals living abroad. 
Moldova's state security service stated it had expelled seven foreign nationals because they posed a threat to national security, without mentioning their nationality. 
An associate of the detainees told reporters he suspected the expulsions had been done at Ankara's behest. The Turkish authorities have not commented on the case so far. 
The detainees were teachers and officials at a network of schools originally set up by the movement of U.S.-based Muslim cleric, Fethullah Gulen, which Turkish authorities hold responsible for a failed 2016 coup in Turkey.
Turkey has put pressure on countries to deport people believed to be linked to schools financed by Gulen, whose movement Ankara has declared a terrorist organization.
""We are deeply concerned about the fate of the seven detained Turkish nationals,"" said Marie Struthers, Amnesty International's Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, in a statement. 
""The Moldovan authorities didn't just violate these individuals' rights once by deporting them – they put them on a fast-track to further human rights violations such as an unfair trial."" 
Another teacher who was detained but later released told reporters: ""we do not know exactly what is happening, but we think that this is an order from Turkey."" 
One of the lawyers of the detainees, Nick Frumos, said he did not know their whereabouts. 
The deputy speaker of the Moldovan parliament publicly questioned the decision to expel the teachers and said he had asked the security service for an explanation. 
President Igor Dodon denied Moldovan media reports that expelling citizens at the behest of the Turkish authorities was one of the conditions attached to Ankara donating $10 million to the renovation of the Moldovan presidential building. 
The building has been empty since 2009 when demonstrators set fire to it. 
Dodon urged the media not to speculate on the expulsions.
""Having received confirmation of the existence of a risk to national security, a decision was made to immediately expel these individuals from the territory of Moldova,"" a statement by the security service said. 
In March this year, anti-corruption prosecutors detained a director of the school network, known as Orizont, for questioning. He was released and then asked for political asylum in Moldova, which was rejected. He left the country and his current whereabouts are not known to the Moldovan authorities.

Macedonia has set Sept. 30 for the referendum on NATO and European Union membership bids and on its agreement with Greece on the country's name.
In June, NATO invited Macedonia to begin accession talks with the alliance, but to finalize membership talks it will have to adopt constitutional changes.
""This is a historic opportunity,"" Stoltenberg said. ""It is a once in a lifetime opportunity to join the international community, to become a member of NATO, to become a member of the EU, but for this you have to agree with the name agreement."" 
Greece refused to accept the Balkan country's name, saying it implied territorial claims on the Greek province of Macedonia and amounted to an appropriation of its ancient civilization. It had blocked the country's EU and NATO membership bids.
Zaev's government, elected in 2017, pushed for an agreement with Greece to solve the name dispute and the two sides have agreed on the name Republic of North Macedonia.
Nationalists, including President Gjorge Ivanov, oppose the deal saying it is against the constitution.

""I believe that the real place for Macedonia is in the European Union and NATO. I’ll continue to support our strategic goals. But, EU and NATO cannot be an alibi for a bad deal,"" Ivanov said in a statement after meeting Stoltenberg.

1695,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",Online mole hunt? Gamblers bet on author of NY Times 'resistance' op-ed,"By Gina Cherelus
(Reuters) - Dan Coats, Mike Pence and Kirstjen Nielsen were among the favorites on Thursday among political gamblers taking an online stab at predicting which senior Trump administration official authored a scathing anonymous column in the New York Times. 
Coats, the director of national intelligence, was seen as having an 18 percent chance of being the writer who said senior officials are part of a ""quiet resistance"" in the administration, according to PredictIt.org, an online market for betting on political events. 
Vice President Pence was listed in second place with a 12 percent chance, while Homeland Security secretary Nielsen came in third with 10 percent. Players can also bet ""no"" for each choice. The ""no"" bets will win if the author is not identified by the end of this year.
The market was slowly attracting participants and the top rankings were expected to fluctuate as it picked up steam, said a spokeswoman for PredictIt, Brandi Travis.
""We had so many traders asking us if there's a market on this,"" Travis said. ""It was definitely something that was in high demand. I think it's going to get a lot of action in terms of trades."" 
Coats and Pence, along with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary James Mattis, have denied writing the article which was published on Wednesday and sent shockwaves through Washington. 
President Donald Trump blasted the anonymous author and the newspaper. The column fueled more accusations by critics that the Republican president was unstable and unfit for the Oval Office.
PredictIt's market, which went live at 11 a.m. EDT and was titled, ""Who will NYT confirm as anonymous op-ed author in 2018,"" listed 19 senior officials as possibilities. Betting was scheduled to run until midnight on Dec. 31, 2018. 
If the author is not identified by the newspaper or an authorized representative by then, the market would close and traders who bet ""yes"" would automatically lose, Travis said. 
""Each of them are individual markets,"" Travis said. ""Whoever bet 'no' will win."" 

""This will be one of the all time great markets,"" wrote trader Dennis Cao in the site's associated 'comments' section.

Together they recited some verses from the Koran, and prayed, hands cupped. Some graves are marked with little more than a few jagged rocks, but all are topped with portraits of the children buried there, killed last month when their school bus was hit by a Saudi-led coalition air strike. 
Hafidh, 11, survived the air strike, but his older brother Waleed was among the 40 children who died on the bus as it drove through a market in Dahyan, a town in the province of Saada. 
Mountainous Saada is the stronghold of the Houthis, the group which controls much of Yemen and the capital Sanaa and which Riyadh has been fighting since 2015. The terrain makes ground battles difficult and the region has been the target of many air strikes.
On Wednesday, thousands of Yemenis massed in Saada city, calling for the prosecution of the Saudi-led military coalition over the air strike on the bus, which drew horrified reactions from around the world. 
""We were coming back (from a school trip) and my brother was sitting next to the bus door,"" Hafidh said. 
""On the bus, the teacher told us that everyone should hold his brother's hand, and then mine was martyred."" 
So many died that a new cemetery had to be built to accommodate the bodies. Inside the hastily erected wall, some of the graves are still empty. 
After initially saying it was a legitimate strike and accusing the Houthis of using children as human shields, the coalition said on Saturday it accepted that the attack was unjustified and pledged to hold accountable anyone who contributed to the error.
The rare concession followed mounting international pressure, including from allies, to do more to limit civilian casualties in the 3-1/2 year civil war that has killed more than 10,000 people and caused a humanitarian disaster.
The conflict shows no sign of being resolved. United Nations-mediated peace talks on Yemen appeared to be in jeopardy on Thursday with no sign in Geneva of the delegation from the Houthi movement on the first day.
In Hafidh's home, a modest house of baked mud bricks in the outskirts of Saada city, a portrait of Waleed hung on the wall, his image laid over a green background - the color of the Houthis - and printed with their slogan: ""Death to America, Death to Israel"".
The boys had been on a school trip to visit the graves of Houthi fighters killed in the war when their bus was struck. 
""The bus was completely destroyed. When I asked about my kids, they warned me that warplanes would strike again ... we searched and found body parts and other wounded children, but could not see mine,"" said Hafidh's father, Abdullah al-Khawlani.
""I found Hafidh in the hospital and asked him about his brother Waleed ... he said they took him and his eyes were closed."" 

A few blocks away lies the mangled wreckage of their bus, now a playground for the neighborhood children.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron took a rare public dig at German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday by questioning her party's ties with Hungary's right-wing leader as the EU prepares for an election next year.
He was speaking after talks in Luxembourg with the three Benelux prime ministers, who share his ""progressive"", centrist agenda and came a day after Merkel backed a German ally to lead a conservative bid for the post of EU chief executive following a European Parliament election next May.
Asked if Merkel's allegiance to the European People's Party and that party's continued embrace of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a sharp critic of Macron's liberal stance, posed a threat to his efforts to rally pro-EU opposition to nationalist forces, Macron said the EPP should ""clarify its positions"".
He also launched a new attack on what he called Orban's abuse of democracy and the rule of law, further staking out what is shaping up to be an EU campaign platform of taking on eurosceptic populists as these have gained support.
Macron stressed that Merkel, a vital ally for the president in his quest to deepen EU integration, was a committed partner. But, he said, the EPP, the biggest bloc in the EU legislature, could not support Merkel and also Orban, who has criticized her welcome for refugees as part of his efforts to curb Brussels' powers.
The EPP, of which Merkel's Christian Democratic Union is a pillar, has resisted calls - including from some of its own members - to expel Orban's Fidesz party or to support a move to sanction Budapest that will be debated in the European Parliament next week.
The EPP and Merkel say that it is vital to maintain links and dialogue with the Hungarians.
Macron called on the EPP to support a vote next week to seek penalties against Hungary and later told a town hall debate in Luxembourg on the future of Europe that fellow Europeans must step up pressure on the likes of Hungary and Poland, which both face accusations from Brussels of undermining the rule of law.
""We have been too slow, too ready to compromise,"" Macron said. ""We have to be much tougher on these issues.""

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 06, 2018 01:00PM ET</span>",Dozens of Venezuelans in Peru seek to return home despite crisis,"By Marco Aquino
LIMA (Reuters) - Dozens of Venezuelans who fled their crisis-stricken country for Peru are seeking to take up a Caracas offer to fly them home, as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro seizes on hardships migrants face abroad to shore up domestic support.
Around 100 Venezuelans were waiting in line outside the Venezuelan embassy in Lima on Wednesday to secure 'repatriation cards' needed for a free flight home, according to a Reuters witness.
Several Venezuelans in the line that Reuters spoke to described suffering discrimination and poor working conditions in Peru, an Andean country of 32 million people where some 300,000 Venezuelan migrants have migrated this year alone.
The mass exodus of Venezuelan migrants in recent years - considered the largest external displacement in modern Latin American history - has strained public services, saturated informal job markets and fueled social tensions in host countries.
Venezuelan migrant Endri Avendano, a 30-year-old former medical technician, said he eked out a living as a waiter and by selling food on the street when he arrived in Lima in May.
""You have to work more than eight hours, sometimes 12 hours"" a day, Avendano said, adding he could no longer find work. He was seeking to return to Venezuela even though food was scarce and expensive there, he said.
Maduro has denied his citizens are fleeing to escape food and medical shortages in Venezuela. He said on Monday that opposition street protests and U.S. financial sanctions had led some Venezuelans to ""try their luck"" in other countries, but that most now regret doing so.
Oscar Perez, a former opposition lawmaker in Venezuela who now lives in Peru and advocates on behalf of Venezuelan migrants, called the repatriations a ""new show"" by Maduro intended to discredit his regional critics.
""It's a perverse plan. Maduro is offering jobs in public administration, repatriation cards, social welfare for those that support him,"" Perez said.
Maduro said on Wednesday that a plane carrying Venezuelans seeking to return from Quito had already arrived in Caracas, and that another was expected shortly from Lima.
A group of 89 Venezuelans returned home from Lima last week, Maduro said.
The exodus of Venezuelans to South American countries is building toward a ""crisis moment"" comparable to events involving refugees in the Mediterranean, the United Nations said last month.
Some 2.3 million Venezuelans are living abroad and more than 1.6 million have left since 2015, according to the U.N.
