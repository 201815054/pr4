LA PAZ (Reuters) - A U.S. jury on Tuesday found former Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and his defense minister responsible for civilian deaths during 2003 street protests in Bolivia, awarding $10 million in compensatory damages to victims' families.
The civil lawsuit was brought a decade ago by eight families whose relatives died during a period of unrest in the poor South American nation. The case went to trial at a federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. 
The plaintiffs accused Bolivia's former government leaders of ordering the military to use violence to crack down on demonstrations against a plan to export natural gas through neighboring Chile. 
Defense lawyers representing the former leaders said they would seek to overturn the verdict. 
The protests during the so-called gas wars in Bolivia left more than 60 people dead and hundreds injured. Sanchez de Lozada, a U.S.-educated mining magnate, and his former defense minister Carlos Sanchez Berzain resigned in October 2003. Both now reside in the United States.
The protests helped spur leftist leader Evo Morales' rise to power. He fulfilled protesters' demands to nationalize the gas industry after taking office in 2006. 
""My respect and admiration for the relatives of the victims of October 2003, for their perseverance, firmness and strength in obtaining a judicial decision that brings us closer and closer to justice,"" Morales said on Twitter on Tuesday.
Bolivia's government has repeatedly sought Lozada's extradition. 
The family members are represented by a team of lawyers from the nonprofit Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), Harvard Law School's International Human Rights Clinic, and several private law firms. The United States allows for the filing of civil suits in the country in certain international human rights cases. 
The plaintiffs included a couple whose eight-year-old daughter was shot by a stray bullet. 
The CCR said in a statement that the three-week trial was the first time in U.S. history that a former head of state had sat before accusers in a U.S. human rights trial. 
Supporters of Sanchez de Lozada have said some of the demonstrators were armed and it was difficult to determine who fired shots in the ensuing chaos. 

""We disagree with the jury's verdict and believe that the proof was so lacking that the case never should have gotten to a jury,"" defense lawyers Stephen D. Raber and Ana C. Reyes of Williams & Connolly said in a statement.

Colombian TV channels aired the video, which shows reporter Javier Ortega, photographer Paul Rivas and driver Efrain Segarra, of Ecuador's El Comercio newspaper, chained by the neck and explaining that the group is conditioning their freedom on the release of three dissidents imprisoned in Ecuador.
""In the hands of the Ecuadorean government are our lives. We just want to say that they are asking for a prisoner exchange. They ask for the three prisoners for our three lives,"" said Ortega.
The group, which calls itself the Oliver Sinisterra Front, is one of several gangs of dissidents from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrillas, who largely demobilized last year under a peace deal with the government.
The dissidents rejected the accord and have continued drug trafficking activities on Colombia's southern border with Ecuador, sometimes attacking Ecuadorean security forces.
""The only thing asked by the Oliver Sinisterra Front is the exchange, nothing else,"" Ortega said, before adding he and his colleagues were physically healthy but emotionally distraught.
Ecuador's government said in a statement on Tuesday it would make every necessary effort to liberate the hostages.
""The video is heartbreaking, seeing them with chains around their necks, but at least we have the comfort of them being OK,"" Cristhian Segarra, the son of driver Segarra, told journalists. ""The conditions are clear - their lives are in the hands of the Ecuadorean state.""

Colombia is offering a reward of more than $100,000 for information leading to the capture or killing of the group's leader, Walter Artizala, who goes by the name Guacho.

The raid came two days after the Supreme Council for Media Regulation, an official oversight body, told the website, Masr al-Arabia, to pay 50,000 Egyptian pounds ($2,849) as a fine for republishing a New York Times article on alleged irregularities during last week's presidential election. 
Two journalists at the website quoted the site's lawyers as saying police said they had acted because the website did not have a permit to operate. The journalists said the raid was prompted by the republishing of the New York Times article. 
A statement from the Supreme Council for Media Regulation, which was based on a complaint from the national election authority, had on Sunday accused the website of publishing false news. 
""The website should have checked the authenticity of the news or commented on it with an opinion,"" the Council statement said, referring to the New York Times article, which said some voters were offered payments and other inducements to vote.
Adel Sabry, the website's editor in chief, was arrested and is being held at Dokki police station in greater Cairo, Mohamed Mounir, Masr al-Arabia's managing editor, told Reuters. 
A security source at the police station said Sabry was being held prior to appearing before a prosecutor. Sabry is accused of running a news website without a permit, the source added.
The office of the website was closed and ""sealed with red wax"", the three journalists said.
Masr al-Arabia is one of about 500 websites that have in recent months been blocked in Egypt, although some are still accessible through virtual networks. Rights groups say the closures amount to a crackdown against freedom of expression.
Authorities say curbing fictitious news is necessary for national security.
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi won a second term with 97 percent of the votes on a turnout of 41 percent, official results showed on Monday. 
Some voters have said they were offered incentives to cast their ballots including money and food, local and international media reported, without saying who had made the offers. Officials said that if any such incidents took place they were not state-sponsored and extremely limited.

""We're here for a long-term relationship with you, where we can support you against all the people who are trying to destroy your liberty,"" said Maurice Glasman, a Labour peer in the House of Lords. ""We also bring, with a full heart, our solidarity,"" he said in Qamishli city, in a stretch of the country which Syrian Kurdish forces mostly control. 
Last month, Turkish forces seized Syria's Afrin region, driving out the Kurdish YPG militia which Ankara deems a menace along its border.
Turkey has threatened to march further east. It sees the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that has waged a decades-long insurgency on Turkish soil. 
Since the start of Syria's multi-sided conflict, the YPG and its allies have carved out autonomous cantons in the north, setting up a federal system of government. Their power grew after taking vast territory from Islamic State with U.S. help - though Washington opposes their political plans, as does the Syrian government. 
Syrian Kurdish leaders say they seek autonomy as part of a decentralized Syria, rather than secession. 
Abed al-Karim Omar, a top member of the self-administration in the north, said the British group that arrived on Tuesday marked the first such public, high-level delegation. 
""There were meetings previously not declared,"" he said. ""But this is the first visit in this official way."" The MPs would discuss Afrin and the tens of thousands residents displaced there, Omar added. 
Glasman said they would tour parts of northern Syria, meeting fighters of the YPG and its all-female YPJ affiliate, as well as local civil councils. 
Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle said they would ""share that back in England with our parliament and with our people,"" and that he hoped for better scrutiny of arms sales to Turkey.
""We want to say we are with you side by side,"" he said.

Sisi, who had no real opposition, was re-elected for a second term with 97 percent of the vote, official returns showed. 
""France offers its wishes for the full success of President Sisi for his second mandate,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Agnes Von Der Muhll said in a daily briefing.
""It hopes that his reelection will allow him to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of the Egyptian people for security, prosperity and the full expression of freedoms in a constitutional framework,"" she said without elaborating.
With both France and Egypt concerned by the political vacuum in Libya and the threat from jihadist groups in Egypt, the two countries have cultivated even closer economic and military ties under Sisi.
Rights organizations have accused France under President Emmanuel Macron of turning a blind eye to what they say are increasing violations of freedoms by Sisi's government.
After hosting Sisi in Paris in October, Macron said it was not up to him to ""lecture"" Egypt on civil liberties.
""France stands resolutely alongside Egypt to face the common challenge of terrorism, to work for the solution of regional crises and to develop cooperation at the United Nations, in Africa and in the Mediterranean,"" von Der Muhll said.

She added that Paris would continue its dialogue with Egypt on human rights and fundamental freedoms.

U.S. President Donald Trump and heads of state from across the Western Hemisphere plan to travel to Peru for the Summit of the Americas, which will celebrate the theme ""democratic governance fighting corruption"" from April 13-14.
In his first speech as Peru's foreign minister, Nestor Popolizio said Peru's decision not to invite Maduro to the event reflects the view of a dozen countries that have been pressuring Venezuela to hold free and fair elections.
Maduro's refusal to heed calls for democratic reforms ""negates even the slightest notion of democracy and represents an insurmountable impediment to taking part in the Summit of the Americas,"" Popolizio said before a crowd of diplomats and journalists in the foreign ministry.
""This is a firm decision that is not up for revision,"" Popolizio said.
Maduro has vowed to attend the Summit of the Americas despite Peru's ban, which the center-right government of former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski announced in February. Maduro says Latin America's right-leaning governments are part of a U.S.-led international conspiracy to topple him and take control of Venezuela's oil resources.
Kuczynski had been one of Maduro's most outspoken critics, calling him a ""dictator"" and demanding he step down.

But Kuczynski resigned after a scandal last month and was replaced by his vice president, Martin Vizcarra. Vizcarra declined to weigh in on Maduro and the summit last week, saying he would leave it up to the foreign ministry.

ANKARA (Reuters) - The leaders of Turkey and Russia marked the official start of work to build Turkey's first nuclear power station on Tuesday, launching construction of the $20 billion Akkuyu plant in the southern province of Mersin.
The plant will be built by Russian state nuclear energy agency Rosatom and will be made up of four units each with a capacity of 1,200 megawatts.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan marked the start to construction, watching by video link from Ankara.
""When all four units go online, the plant will meet 10 percent of Turkey's energy needs,"" Erdogan said, adding that despite delays Turkey still planned to start generating power at the first unit in 2023.
Speaking at a later news conference with Putin, Erdogan said the cost of the project may exceed the planned $20 billion for the 4,800 megawatt (MW) plant, part of Erdogan's ""2023 vision"" marking 100 years since the founding of modern Turkey and intended to reduce Turkey's dependence on energy imports.
Since Russia was awarded the contract in 2010, the project has been beset by delays.
Last month, sources familiar with the matter said Akkuyu was likely to miss its 2023 target start-up date, but Rosatom, which is looking for local partners to take a 49 percent stake in the project, said it is committed to the timetable.
The Interfax news agency cited the head of Rosatom saying the sale of the 49 percent stake was likely to be postponed from this year until 2019.
Turkish companies have been put off by the size of the financing required as well as by concerns they will not receive a sufficient share of the lucrative construction side of the deal, two industry sources have said.
Erdogan told the news conference Turkey may cooperate with Russia on defense projects besides the S-400 missile defense system which Moscow has agreed to supply to Ankara. He did not give further details.
Turkey signed an agreement to buy the S-400 system in late December in a move which raised concern in the West because it cannot be integrated into NATO's military architecture. 

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani will join Erdogan and Putin for a three-way summit on Syria in Ankara on Wednesday.

At around 5 a.m. (0400 GMT), armed anti-balaka militants attacked the base in Tagbara, about 300 km (190 miles) northeast of the capital Bangui, a U.N. statement said. 
The ensuing gunfight lasted hours, and 22 anti-balaka were also killed, the statement said. 
Later in the morning, peacekeepers discovered 21 dead civilians, including four children, near a church in Tagbara. It was not immediately clear who was responsible for those deaths. 
""Nothing can justify such acts that can be considered war crimes,"" the statement said. ""An investigation will be conducted and will leave no room for impunity.""
Central African Republic was torn apart after mainly Muslim Seleka rebels ousted president Francois Bozize in 2013, provoking retaliation killings by the anti-balaka.
A 12,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission has struggled to restore order to the countryside where attacks on civilians are frequent. The U.N. Security Council approved an extra 900 peacekeepers in November to help to protect civilians.
The mission has become a deadly one: more than a dozen U.N. peacekeepers were killed there last year.

Speaking at a news conference in Ankara, Putin also said he was surprised by the pace of what he called an anti-Russian campaign unleashed Britain's accusation that Moscow was behind the nerve toxin attack on Skripal on March 4. 
He noted that the head of Britain's Porton Down military research laboratory had said earlier in the day that it was not possible to say yet where the military-grade nerve agent that struck down Skripal had been produced. Putin said there were about 20 countries where such substances were made.

Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters that Britain's theory on who poisoned Skripal ""will not be confirmed anyway."" Moscow has denied being behind the attack on Skripal and his daughter in the southern English city of Salisbury.

Until now, 5-Star had said it was ready to talk to all parties after the March 4 national election ended in a hung parliament.
In an interview recorded by La7 TV channel and not yet broadcast, Luigi Di Maio said 5-Star was open to talks with the center-left Democratic Party (PD), though not to its former secretary Matteo Renzi, and the far-right League, but not with Forza Italia, two 5-Star sources said.
""We will propose a government contract like the Germans do and what is written is done, and what is not written does not get done,"" Di Maio told 5-Star lawmakers on Tuesday according to a statement.
The move will heighten tensions between the League and Forza Italia, which are partners in a center-right coalition that won the most seats in parliament. Forza Italia had no immediate comment. 
""The coalition that won the most votes is the center-right and this is our starting point,"" League leader Matteo Salvini said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). ""We will dialogue with 5-Star, but reject vetoes or commands."" 
In the election, the 5-Star followed the center right but was the single largest party, and the PD was third, but no one has enough seats to govern alone.
The 5-Star position will also put pressure on the PD to consider joining a coalition with 5-Star. So far the PD has toed the hard line - set by Renzi before he resigned as party leader in the wake of the vote - to not consider a deal with 5-Star.
""The 5-Star leader's proposal is unacceptable,"" Andrea Marcucci, the PD's Senate leader, said on Twitter.
Though the sources did not say what reason Di Maio gave for rejecting Forza Italia, the 5-Star has always been hostile to Berlusconi because the party has vowed to clean up Italian politics. Berlusconi has a conviction for tax fraud and is on trial in another case for allegedly bribing witnesses.
President Sergio Mattarella on Wednesday begins formal consultations in which he will try to get rivals to seek common ground and form a government together. He will meet the main parties, including 5-Star, on Thursday.

But more consultations could be held later and the process could take weeks. If no deal can be found, Mattarella may be forced to call a new election.

""The campaign is ongoing as long as there is even a simple case (of corruption) ... and it will not end until (all) corruption cases are finished,"" prosecutor Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb told state television in a clip posted online, without providing details.
Authorities rounded up dozens of princes, top officials and businessmen in November on Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's orders, with many confined and interrogated at Riyadh's opulent Ritz-Carlton Hotel.
Most detainees, including global investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, were released after being exonerated or reaching financial settlements with the government, which says it arranged to seize more than $100 billion through such deals.
The Ritz was cleared out and reopened to the public in February, though 56 people who had not reached settlements by then remained in custody and could face trial.
Prince Mohammed is currently touring the United States to promote investment in the kingdom, touting the corruption sweep as critical to transforming an oil-dependent economy long plagued by graft but now contending with lower global crude prices.

Yet the campaign remains shrouded in secrecy with few specific allegations or details of financial settlements revealed.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles joined the ruling Brazilian Democratic Movement party (MDB) on Tuesday with an eye to running for president or becoming President Michel Temer's running mate in the October election.
Meirelles, 72, has openly weighed a presidential bid, but might have to settle for running for vice president if Temer ends up trying for the presidency, despite his polling in the low single digits in recent surveys.
Meirelles left the Social Democratic Party (PSD) when it became clear the party planned to back Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin in his presidential run. 
Meirelles, a former banking executive and central bank governor, said the MDB, Brazil's largest party, would decide the ticket at its convention in June or July.
Meirelles all but said he will resign as minister by the end of the week, which under Brazilian election law is the deadline for leaving a government position before the campaign.
""I should stay until Friday,"" he told reporters. 
Deputy Finance Minister Eduardo Guardia is expected to replace him and continue his policies of fiscal restraint.
Meirelles said the purpose of teaming up with Temer in the elections was to continue the government's work recovering Latin America's largest economy from its worst recession on record. 
""Our priorities with Temer are to create more jobs, expand income and create equal opportunities for Brazilians,"" he told party leaders at a meeting that felt like the launch of the Temer-Meirelles ticket with a campaign jingle playing loudly.
""Yes, it is almost the start of the campaign, we just do not know who will be the presidential candidate and who will be the running mate,"" said a party strategist, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to talk about the matter.
Temer, 77, came to power in 2016 when former President Dilma Rousseff was impeached. He has signaled he wants to run for the presidency and has to decide before the party convention whether he is a viable contender to keep the top job.
If Temer's approval rating does not improve by then, Meirelles would be the government's presidential candidate, Temer aides told Reuters last week.
More than one-third of Temer's cabinet will have resigned by the end of this week to campaign for their Congressional seats in the Oct. 7 general election, the aides said. 

Meirelles, a former chairman of now defunct BankBoston, was Brazil's central bank governor during the 2003-2010 presidency of leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva when a commodities boom boosted prosperity and rapid growth.

Saadi Gaddafi, who has been held in the capital Tripoli since his extradition from Niger in 2014, was found not guilty of ""murder, deception, threats, enslavement and defamation of the former player Bashir Rayani,"" a statement from the ministry said.
He was fined 500 Libyan dinars ($377) and given a suspended one-year prison sentence for drinking and possession of alcohol in the 2006 case, the statement said. 
Saadi Gaddafi, who under his father had a career as a footballer in Libya and Italy and was also a special forces commander, still faces other charges in Tripoli relating to the 2011 NATO-backed revolt.
He fled to Niger during the uprising, in which his father was overthrown and killed.

Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's government secured a simple majority in parliament on Monday to pass the bill, which sets out fines of up to 500,000 ringgit ($123,000) and a maximum six years in jail.
The United States is concerned about the bill’s ""potential impact on freedom of expression in Malaysia, as well as its global reach, which could impact U.S. citizens and companies,"" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement. 
The statement said the measure had moved ""rapidly through Parliament without meaningful public consultation and debate,"" and urged the Malaysian government to consult with the business community and civil society before taking further action on the bill.
In Malaysia, a bill requires the assent of the country's figurehead sultan after passing parliament, but this is generally seen as a formality.
""We urge the Government of Malaysia to ensure that all its laws, existing and future, fully respect freedom of expression,"" the State Department spokesperson said.
Trump often uses the term fake news to condemn news reports or organizations whose findings he disputes or that are critical of him. The term has also quickly become part of the standard repertoire of leaders in authoritarian countries.
Malaysia, where a general election could be imminent, is among the first countries to introduce such a law. Other Southeast Asian countries, including Singapore and the Philippines, are considering how to tackle fake news. Rights activists worry that anti-fake news laws could be used to stifle free speech.
On Tuesday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered the withdrawal of rules punishing journalists held responsible for distributing fake news, giving no reason for the change, less than 24 hours after the original announcement. The move followed an outcry by journalists and opposition politicians.
Malaysia's bill defines fake news as “news, information, data and reports which is or are wholly or partly false,” and includes features, visuals and audio recordings.
It covers digital publications and social media and will apply to offenders who maliciously spread fake news inside and outside Malaysia, including foreigners, if Malaysia or a Malaysian citizen were affected. 

News reports and social media posts on a multi-billion-dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB)have dogged Prime Minister Najib, who faces arguably his toughest contest in a general election that is due this year and could be called in days. Najib has denied any wrongdoing in connection with losses at the fund.

""We don't know what President Trump is talking about when he says that Honduras doesn't do anything"" to stop illegal immigration, presidential spokesman Ebal Diaz said on a local TV program. 
""I think he is not well informed, I think he is unfairly using Honduras in a political debate he has with the U.S. Congress,"" Diaz said, adding that Honduras deserved respect.
Trump threatened in a Twitter post on Tuesday to cut off aid to Honduras in his latest criticism of the migrant caravan that set off from Mexico's southern border with Central America late last month.
The U.S. president has stepped up his immigration rhetoric in recent days and his administration has moved to further crack down on people who are in the United States illegally.
""The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our 'Weak Laws' Border, had better be stopped before it gets there. Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
Organized caravans of predominantly Central American migrants, including many escaping drug and gang-related violence in Honduras, have crossed Mexico since 2010, according to Mexico's government.
""The causes of immigration are violence, drug violence, drug trafficking. What has President Trump done to reduce the demand for the drugs that enters that market (in the United States) that generates violence in our country?,"" said Diaz.
Honduras’ murder rate has been falling steadily in recent years, after hitting 85.5 murders per 100,000 people in 2011. Nonetheless, Honduras remains one of the world’s deadliest peacetime nations.
""We appreciate the help from the United States but we deserve respect as a nation ... Honduras will continue to grow, with or without the support of President Trump,"" said Diaz.

GAZA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A Palestinian man was killed by Israeli gunfire in Gaza on Tuesday, Palestinian medics said, raising the death toll from clashes along the border to 17, and Israel's defence minister warned further protests would be met with similar force.
Tens of thousands of Palestinians began a six-week-long protest last Friday in tent encampments set up along the fenced border of the Israeli-blockaded Gaza Strip. They are pressing for a right of return for refugees to the villages and towns where their families lived before 1948 in what is now Israel.
Sixteen Palestinians died after being shot by Israeli troops on the first day of the protest, Palestinian medical officials said. The 17th Palestinian killed, 25-year-old Ahmed Omar Arafa, was standing about 50 metres (165 feet) from the fence when he was shot, his father, Omar Arafa, told Reuters. 
""He was standing next to me; he posed no danger to them but they killed him,"" he said. An Israeli military spokeswoman had no initial information on the latest reported fatality. 
The deaths occurred in the course of one of the largest Palestinian demonstrations along the 65-km (40-mile) border in years. Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman defended Israel's response. 
""I warn (Gaza protesters) against continuing the provocation. We have set clear game rules and we do not intend to change them. Every person who comes close to the fence is endangering their lives,"" he said on a visit to the border.
""This was a well-organised provocation by Hamas's armed wing in an attempt to harm our sovereignty, to disrupt daily life and to disturb Israelis on their Seder (traditional Passover meal) night. We are doing what we must do.""
Gaza, a small coastal enclave, has been ruled by Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist movement sworn to Israel's destruction, for much of the time since Israeli soldiers and settlers withdrew in 2005 after a 38-year occupation.
The military said its troops used live fire only against people trying to sabotage the fence or rolling burning tyres and throwing rocks. Palestinian organisers said they had called for a peaceful protest and Hamas denied that its fighters had fired on Israeli forces, using the crowds as cover, though it said five of the dead were members of its armed wing.
Lieberman has characterised most of those killed last week as ""terrorists that we know well who are active in the armed wing of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. They were not innocent civilians who were part of a civil protest"". 
In Gaza, protesters have begun gathering thousands of mirrors which they hope to use to blind Israeli soldiers on the other side of the fence. The protesters say they also intend to use laser pointers to distract Israeli army sharpshooters.
“We were saddened by the martyrdom of 16 of us, some of them we knew as friends. This Friday we shall rise to challenge the occupation which killed them, and show them we are not afraid,” said Issa Abu Jamea', 29, from Khan Younis in Gaza's south.
He said he had taken part in protests every Friday since U.S. President Donald Trump's Dec. 6 decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and to move the U.S. Embassy to the city. Its eastern half was taken by Israel in a 1967 war and is wanted by Palestinians for the capital of a future state.
FRIDAY OF TYRES
Palestinian organisers said they expect the number of participants to again swell to tens of thousands on Friday. 
Riding on donkey carts and rickshaws, protesters scoured towns and villages across Gaza on Tuesday collecting old tyres from mechanics' shops, fields and garbage dumps. The thick, black smoke emitted by burning tyres can reduce the effects of tear gas used by Israel security forces, they say.
Abu Jamea' said that he and his friends had collected about a thousand tyres. The hash tag ""Jomaat Al-Kawshook"", or ""Friday of Tyres"", was trending on Twitter. 
""We have prepared mirrors, lasers and tyres to burn ... they will help to distract Israeli snipers and blind them. We aim to protect ourselves and the protesters,"" Abu Jamea' said.
In Gaza City, Daoud Shehab, a protest organiser who is also spokesman for the militant Islamic Jihad, urged participants to remain peaceful. ""We urge our people not to fall for Israeli provocation attempts,"" said Shebab.
The protest action is set to wind up on May 15, when Palestinians mark the “Naqba”, or “Catastrophe”, when hundreds of thousands fled or were driven out of their homes during violence that culminated in war in May 1948 between the newly created state of Israel and its Arab neighbours.

Israel has long ruled out any right of return, fearing it would lose its Jewish majority.

SOWETO, South Africa (Reuters) - As tributes poured in for Winnie Madikizela-Mandela who died on Monday, the head of South Africa's leftist opposition party said misogynists in the ruling ANC had prevented her taking her rightful place as president.
Senior African National Congress (ANC) figures stood side-by-side with members of the hard-left Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party outside Madikizela-Mandela's red-brick house in Soweto, chanting songs from the struggle against white minority rule as mourners gathered for a second day.
""Winnie Mandela was supposed to be president of South Africa,"" EFF leader Julius Malema told the crowd. 
""But the men in the ANC were threatened by a woman and the whites were threatened by an African woman. That's why they did everything to destroy her.""
Former ANC youth leader Malema - a strident critic of ousted president Jacob Zuma - was close to Madikizela-Mandela and has the same straight-talking appeal. 
He was ejected from the ANC after being convicted of hate speech and created the EFF in 2013 which grew to be strong enough to be a 'kingmaker' in local government elections in 2016.
An ANC spokesman did not answer his phone when Reuters called to request comment on Malema's remarks.
Madikizela-Mandela campaigned tirelessly for her husband Nelson Mandela's release from jail and emerged as a prominent liberation hero in her own right, but her legacy was later tarnished by allegations of violence.
She was among candidates for ANC deputy president in 1997, a position that would have teed her up for a top national leadership role, but withdrew her bid after failing to secure sufficient support.
""The Mother of the Nation would have restored the dignity of black people,"" Malema said, adopting an epithet widely used in South African media to reflect respect for Madikizela-Mandela's outspoken opposition to the apartheid regime.
Few ordinary South Africans focused on the darker chapters of her past, including a conviction for kidnapping and assaulting an activist found with his throat cut near her Soweto home.
""May she rest in peace for all the great work she has done,"" said Johannesburg resident Esther Shabangu.
""I wish that all of us as women would take on the legacy she has left for black people in this country.""
Malema said Madikizela-Mandela's 1991 conviction was a sham and pledged that the EFF would fight for the rights of black South Africans just as fearlessly as the anti-apartheid stalwart.
""The spear has fallen,"" Malema said. ""We are here to pick up the spear."" 
Madikizela-Mandela will be given a state funeral at a stadium in Soweto on April 14, President Cyril Ramaphosa's office said in a statement declaring national days of mourning between April 3 and 14.

21,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 02:37PM ET</span>",UK military research boss says unable to say yet whether nerve agent was made in Russia: Sky,"LONDON (Reuters) - The head of Britain's military research center said on Tuesday it was unable yet to say whether the military-grade nerve agent that poisoned a Russian double-agent last month had been produced in Russia.
""We were able to identify it as Novichok, to identify that it was military-grade nerve agent,"" Gary Aitkenhead, chief executive of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down in England, told Sky News.
""We have not identified the precise source, but we have provided the scientific info to government who have then used a number of other sources to piece together the conclusions you have come to.""
However, he confirmed the substance required ""extremely sophisticated methods to create, something only in the capabilities of a state actor"".
He added: ""we are continuing to work to help to provide additional information that might help us get closer to [the source] but we haven't yet been able to do that.""
Moscow has denied being behind the attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the southern English city of Salisbury on March 4.
After the first known use of a military-grade nerve agent on European soil since World War Two, Britain blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for the attempted murder, and the West has expelled around 130 Russian diplomats.
Armin Laschet, a conservative ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said the comment raised questions about Britain's drive to persuade allies to expel Russian diplomats.
""If one forces nearly all NATO countries into solidarity, shouldn't one have certain evidence? Regardless of what one thinks about Russia, my study of international law taught me a different way to deal with other states,"" Laschet, premier of the state of North Rhine-Westphlia, said on Twitter.
Aitkenhead said the British government had ""other inputs"" it could use to determine the origin of the nerve agent, some of them intelligence-based.
He reiterated that the substance could not have come from Porton Down.
Russia's EU ambassador Vladimir Chizhov noted in an interview with the BBC last month that the British research lab is only eight miles (11 km) from Salisbury, insinuating that may have been the source.
A government spokesperson said on Tuesday: ""We have been clear from the very beginning that our world leading experts at Porton Down identified the substance used in Salisbury as a Novichok, a military grade nerve agent.
""This is only one part of the intelligence picture. As the Prime Minister (Theresa May) has set out ... this includes our knowledge that within the last decade, Russia has investigated ways of delivering nerve agents probably for assassination – and as part of this program has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichoks; Russia’s record of conducting state-sponsored assassinations; and our assessment that Russia views former intelligence officers as targets.""
Skripal's daughter Yulia is getting better after spending three weeks in critical condition due to the nerve toxin attack at her father's home in Salisbury, the hospital where she is being treated said last Thursday.

Her father remained in a critical but stable condition.

ANKARA/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Three foreign powers who have shaped Syria's civil war - Iran, Russia and Turkey - will discuss ways to wind down the fighting on Wednesday despite their involvement in rival military campaigns on the ground. 
The leaders of the three countries will meet in Ankara for talks on a new constitution for Syria and increasing security in ""de-escalation"" zones across the country, Turkish officials say. 
The Syria summit brings together two powers which have been President Bashar al-Assad's most forceful supporters, Iran and Russia, with one of his strongest opponents, Turkey.
Cooperation between the rival camps raised hopes of stabilizing Syria after seven years of conflict in which 500,000 people have been killed and half the population displaced.
But the violence has raged on, highlighting strategic rifts between the three countries who, in the absence of decisive Western intervention, hold Syria's fate largely in their hands. 
Syria's army and Iran-backed militias, with Russian air power, have crushed insurgents near Damascus in eastern Ghouta - one of the four mooted ""de-escalation zones"".
Turkey, which sharply criticized the Ghouta offensive, waged its own military operation to drive Kurdish YPG fighters from the northwestern Syrian region of Afrin. It has pledged to take the town of Tel Rifaat and push further east, angering Iran.
""Whatever the intentions are, Turkey's moves in Syria, whether in Afrin, Tel Rifaat or any other part of Syria, should be halted as soon as possible,"" a senior Iranian official said.
Iran has been Assad's most supportive ally throughout the conflict. Iran-backed militias first helped his army stem rebel advances and, following Russia's entry into the war in 2015, turn the tide decisively in Assad's favor.
A Turkish official said Ankara will ask Moscow to press Assad to grant more humanitarian access in Ghouta, and to rein in air strikes on rebel-held areas. ""We expect ... Russia to control the regime more,"" the official told reporters this week.
RIFTS OVER ASSAD
Ankara's relations with Moscow collapsed in 2015 when Turkey shot down a Russian warplane but have recovered since then - to the concern of Turkey's Western allies.
Turkey was one of the few NATO partners not to expel Russian diplomats in response to a nerve agent attack on a former Russian agent which Britain blamed on Moscow - an allegation which Turkey said was not proven. 
Improved political ties have been reflected in Turkey's agreement to buy a Russian missile defence system and plans for Russia's ROSATOM to build Turkey's first nuclear power plant.
Turkey has also expanded relations with Iran, exchanging visits by military chiefs of staff, although its deepening ties with Tehran and Moscow have not translated into broader agreement on Syria's future. 
Iran remains determined that Assad stay in power, while Russia is less committed to keeping him in office, a regional diplomat said. Turkey says Assad has lost legitimacy, although it no longer demands his immediate departure.
At a meeting in Russia two months ago, boycotted by the leadership of Syria's opposition, delegates agreed to set up a committee to rewrite Syria's constitution and called for democratic elections. 
Turkey says Wednesday's meeting will discuss setting up the constitutional committee, humanitarian issues and developments in Syria's northern Idlib region, which is under the control of rival rebel factions and jihadi groups, and where Turkey has set up seven military observation posts.
""There are issues where all three countries have different policies in Syria,"" another Turkish official said. ""In this regard, an aim is to find middle ground and create policies to improve the current situation.""

Mnangagwa, who was sworn in as president in November after a de facto military coup ended Robert Mugabe's 37-year rule, has vowed to rebuild his country’s ravaged economy and re-engage with the international community.
China had considered Mugabe a ""good friend"" in a relationship dating back to its support for Zimbabwe's independence war, but pointedly failed to support him when he was ousted.
“I'm willing to work with Mr President to jointly map out our future cooperation and write a new chapter in China-Zimbabwe relations for the benefit of our two peoples,"" Xi said, during a meeting in Beijing.
China has growing interest in investing in Africa's natural resources and has poured more than $100 billion into roads, railways, mines, powerlines and factories on the continent over the last decade.
Trade between China and African countries reached $85.3 billion in the first half of 2017, according to Chinese state media.
Xi said China has been happy to see the economic reform policies that Mnangagwa put in place after the ""peaceful, smooth"" transfer of power.
Mnangagwa said that Zimbabwe appreciated China's political support and goodwill and thanked Xi for sending an envoy immediately upon his inauguration.
""That was a great honor,"" he said.
China continued to invest in large infrastructure projects in Zimbabwe throughout Mugabe's rule as his government, sanctioned by Western nations for human rights abuses, increasingly turned to Beijing for help.
With his visit, Zimbabwe would attempt to tap China's huge financial resources, technical expertise and modern technology in order to help revive the economy, Mnangagwa told the official Xinhua news agency in an interview on Saturday.
In December, Zimbabwe signed a $153 million loan agreement with China to expand and refurbish its international airport in Harare in a bid to attract investors and tourists, the first such deal under the new government.
China's foreign ministry said a trip to Beijing by Zimbabwe's military chief one week before the army seized power in the South African nation was a ""normal military exchange"" amid speculation at the time he had come to brief on plans to seize power.

Mnangagwa is likely to join other African leaders coming to Beijing in September for a summit held once every three years.

LONDON (Reuters) - London police investigated more murders than their New York counterparts did over the last two months, statistics show, as the British capital's mayor vowed to fight a ""violent scourge"" on the streets.
There were 15 murders in London in February against 14 in New York, according to London's Metropolitan Police Service and the New York Police Department. For March, 22 murders were investigated in London, with 21 reports in New York. 
In the latest bloodshed, a 17-year-old girl died on Monday after she was found with gunshot wounds in Tottenham, north London, a day after a man was fatally stabbed in south London.
""The Mayor is deeply concerned by violent crime in the capital - every life lost to violent crime is a tragedy,"" a spokeswoman for Mayor Sadiq Khan said in a statement on Tuesday.
""Our city remains one of the safest in the world ... but Sadiq wants it to be even safer and is working hard to bring an end to this violent scourge.""
Including January's figures, New York had still experienced more murders so far this year than London. The cities have a similar-sized population.
Gun violence is much less of a problem in Britain, which has strict gun control laws, than in the United States, and most British police are not equipped with firearms.
But British politicians and police are increasingly expressing concern about London's rising murder rate, which is driven by a surge in knife crime. Of the 47 murders in London so far this year, 31 have been committed with knives. 
Britain's interior ministry said it was consulting on new laws to further restrict dangerous weapons, including banning online stores from delivering knives to residential addresses and making it an offence to possess certain weapons in public.
""This government is taking action to restrict access to offensive weapons as well as working to break the deadly cycle of violence and protect our children, families and communities,"" a Home Office spokesman said.
Khan, who has been in office since May 2016, is from the opposition Labour Party. Before him, Conservative Boris Johnson was mayor for eight years. The national government has been run by the Conservatives since 2010, with Prime Minister Theresa May previously serving as interior minister from 2010 to 2016.
Britain's most senior officer, London police chief Cressida Dick, said gangs were using online platforms to glamorize violence, adding that disputes between young people could escalate within minutes on social media. 
The Ben Kinsella Trust, an anti-knife crime charity named after a young victim, said social media amplified a range of other factors that have contributed to the crisis. 
The charity's CEO Patrick Green said there had been extra funding to tackle knife crime, which he welcomed, but added that the government needed to act with more urgency and that budget cuts affecting youth services had played a part.
""This has been a horrendous year. It's looking like it'll be worse that last year, which was worse than the year before,"" he told Reuters.

""The response so far has been too slow... It feels like we're in a crisis and we need to respond in that way.""

25,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 10:38AM ET</span>",As seen on TV: How inventor Joy Mangano designs a better life,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Is the plot of your life worthy of a big-budget Hollywood film?
For most of us, the answer is probably no. Then there is Joy Mangano.
The inspiration behind the movie “Joy” starring Jennifer Lawrence was not always the reigning queen of home shopping, with over $3 billion in sales of products like the Miracle Mop. At one time she was a divorced Long Island mom of three young kids, just scrambling to make ends meet.
The author of the recent book “Inventing Joy,” the HSN executive chatted with Reuters about how to design a better life for yourself.
Q: Did you have an inventor’s mindset, even as a kid?
A: I loved learning, but I was a skinny little girl with glasses and braces, so honestly those early school years were a little tough. The first person who displayed some real empathy towards me was my third grade teacher, Miss Haffercamp. She told me I was fantastic, and that really left an imprint on me.
Q: Your journey as an inventor did not really start until after your marriage ended?
A: I grew up in an Italian family on Long Island. As soon as you left school, you got married and had children. You were a mom, and that was it. So ending my marriage was the hardest decision I ever made and the saddest. 
I realized my life was entirely up to me. It absolutely slays you. So I said, ‘I have to turn into Courageous Joy!’ From then on, everything I did – working odd jobs and making money wherever I could - was to create a solid foundation and positive environment for my kids.
Q: At what point did you realize you could make a living at inventing?
A: I started toying with a few different things, like designing a fluorescent flea collar. Then the Miracle Mop was something I thought could be phenomenal.
But that didn’t happen for a while. I sold some to hardware stores, and to Amway, and to K-Mart, but it wasn’t enough to be sustainable. 
The movie captures perfectly what happened next: When Jennifer Lawrence is standing on stage at QVC for the first time, and the phones start ringing off the hook. My whole world exploded. The product grew wings and just took off.
Q: When extreme success hit, how did you handle that?
A: I was unaware that with success come a whole lot of obstacles. Not just legal obstacles, but even run-ins with gangsters. You can’t make this stuff up! 
After I got an order for 60,000 mops that first time, I had to develop a long-term strategy and bring in a financial controller. You can’t do everything yourself; you have to put together a team and focus on what you do best.
Q: Where did you invest that sudden wealth?
A: In the beginning, every single penny went back into the business. That was critical, because I was building a brand. Now, I’m more of a home lover, so I tend to invest in real estate. I also own a restaurant on Long Island, Jema, because I believe in diversification. That one is a labor of love.
Q: Any role models who have given you useful advice for this wild journey?
A: One man is Tony Curto, who as my attorney was with me when we sold the company. In business you have to find someone you trust implicitly, who you know is completely honest, and he was that for me. He would remind me to pay attention to life, and not just business. Sometimes I found it hard to do that.
Q: What advice would you have for other budding entrepreneurs?
A: Go for it, but you don’t have to go crazy and sell your house or anything. When I started I took very little steps, and it was an extremely slow process. I didn’t have much money, and didn’t risk my family’s well-being. 
Q: Your kids are now in the business too, so any words of warning for them?

A: When you become successful, everybody thinks you are going to sit back and bask in that glory. Not true – the opposite happens. So you really better love what you do, because if you become successful, you are going to get even busier.

YEKATERINBURG/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Lawmakers in Russia's fourth largest city Yekaterinburg voted to scrap direct mayoral elections on Tuesday, curtailing the political prospects of the incumbent who has been fiercely critical of the Kremlin and local authorities.
Opposition politician Yevgeny Roizman unexpectedly won the mayoral race in 2013, narrowly edging out the candidate of the ruling United Russia Party and gaining a measure of control over the city around 1,500 km (900 miles) east of Moscow.
Roizman has since been critical of President Vladimir Putin and the pro-Kremlin governor of the Sverdlovsk region, in which Yekaterinburg lies. They mayor has also expressed support for opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was barred from running in last month's Russian presidential election which Putin won. 
On Tuesday, lawmakers in Yekaterinburg - a manufacturing center of almost 1.5 million people - voted by 42-4 to abolish direct elections. In future, the city's mayor will be chosen by local lawmakers from a shortlist drawn up by a special commission. 
The idea of scrapping direct elections was proposed by Sverdlovsk region governor Yevgeny Kuivashev. His allies had argued that doing away with elections would save money and streamline decision-making.
Just under 2,000 people held a rally on Monday, demanding that direct elections be kept and that the governor resign.
Roizman, whose five-year term ends in September, told lawmakers on Tuesday that the elections were the only chance for Yekaterinburg residents to take part in its political life and that stripping them of the right to elect a mayor was an insult to their intellectual capabilities.
Opposition leader Navalny said the outcome of the vote ran counter to what people wanted.
""Forty-two deputies have demonstratively spat not only on the thousands of people who turned up at the rally, but also on the majority who have told every opinion poll that the mayor must be chosen via direct voting,"" Navalny wrote on social media.
Less than 10 Russian cities still have direct mayoral elections with the rest using an appointment system. 
The Kremlin declined to comment on Yekaterinburg's decision, saying it was purely a matter for local lawmakers.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Myanmar's panel of international advisers on Rohingya issues said on Tuesday that the coming monsoon season could bring ""enormous deaths"" as refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh are not built to withstand the storms.
Rights groups say some 700,000 mostly Muslim Rohingya have fled violence and crossed the border from Myanmar's Rakhine state since August and most live in flimsy, bamboo-and-plastic structures perched on what were once forested hills at Cox's Bazaar. 
""We are at this time in a race against time. For us, the monsoons are coming. The camps of almost one million people are not built to withstand monsoon,"" Kobsak Chutikul, the head of the secretariat of the board, said at a press conference in Singapore. 
""There will be enormous deaths if all parties do not move to some understanding on repatriation, on aid.""
Because a repatriation deal between the neighboring countries has been delayed, Bangladesh is racing to prepare new homes on a nearby island, called Bhasan Char, before the monsoons that could arrive later this month.
The Advisory Board for the Committee for Implementation of the Recommendations on Rakhine State was set up by Myanmar last year to advise on ways of adopting the findings of an earlier commission headed by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
Computer modeling by the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) shows that more than 100,000 refugees will be threatened by landslides and floods in the coming monsoons. The rains typically begin in April and peak in July, according to the Bangladesh Meteorological Department.
Chutikul's comments came as Malaysia intercepted a boat 56 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar off its northern island of Langkawi after a storm.
Malaysia will allow them to enter on humanitarian grounds, with rights groups expecting further such perilous journeys by sea. 
The Rohingya fled their homes in Rakhine into Bangladesh after militant attacks in August last year sparked a military crackdown that the United Nations and Western countries have said constitutes ethnic cleansing.
Buddhist-majority Myanmar rejects that charge, saying its forces have been waging a legitimate campaign against ""terrorists"" who attacked government forces.

The king also emphasized the need to advance the peace process in a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday night, made after Israeli security forces killed 16 Palestinians last week during a demonstration along the Israel-Gaza border
King Salman reaffirmed ""the kingdom's steadfast position toward the Palestinian issue and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people to an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital"", state news agency SPA said on Tuesday.
The report did not refer to the comments by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in an interview published on Monday by U.S. magazine The Atlantic, which are the latest public sign that ties between Saudi Arabia and Israel may be growing closer.
Asked if he believes the Jewish people have a right to a nation-state in at least part of their ancestral homeland, Prince Mohammed was quoted as saying:
""I believe the Palestinians and the Israelis have the right to have their own land. But we have to have a peace agreement to assure the stability for everyone and to have normal relations.""
Saudi Arabia, birthplace of Islam and home to its holiest shrines, does not recognize Israel. It has maintained for years that normalizing relations hinges on Israeli withdrawal from Arab lands captured in the 1967 Middle East war, territory Palestinians seek for a future state.

Increased tension between Riyadh and Tehran has fueled speculation that shared interests may push Saudi Arabia and Israel to work together against what they see as a common Iranian threat.

The global #MeToo movement has accelerated in South Korea since January, spawning accusations of sexual misconduct and prosecution investigations of prominent figures. 
Fear of reprisal has made South Koreans traditionally wary of being whistleblowers over harassment at family-run conglomerates that dominate the economy, with open accusations of this type far outnumbered by anonymous posts on the subject. 
Yonhap, citing Hyundai Motor, said a female employee had made the accusation while preparing to leave the company, saying the woman executive had pressured her female subordinates to attend a drinking party with senior men and pour drinks. 
She also accused the executive of pressuring the women to dance with men at a karaoke session, and said the men were in positions that could influence the female executive's position in the corporation, Yonhap reported. 
In a statement, Hyundai Motor said media reports on the issue did not reflect its views and policies. 
""We will take appropriate actions on any irregularities or breaches by individuals within the company that do not ensure equality in the workplace,"" it said, declining further comment. 
Neither Hyundai Motor nor the news agency identified the executive. 

Hyundai Motor had three female executives among its total of 298 executives by the end of 2017, regulatory filings show.

Madsen, 47, is accused of murdering and dismembering Wall, a 30-year-old Swedish journalist who was researching a story on the Danish inventor and the submarine he had built. Prosecutors say she died either by strangulation or by having her throat cut. Madsen faces up to life in prison if convicted .
He denies murdering Wall, although he admits he cut up her body so he could get it out of the 17-metre (56-foot) submarine. He intended to dispose of the body parts at sea to restore a ""normal"" condition on board, he said, adding that he was not thinking rationally at the time.

Teachers' union officials estimated 30,000 educators were off the job in Oklahoma on Tuesday and that classes were canceled for some 500,000 of the state's 700,000 public school students - similar to the numbers in Monday's walkout.
The protests reflected rising discontent after years of sluggish or declining public school spending in Oklahoma, which ranked 47th among the 50 U.S. states in per-student expenditure, and 48th in average teacher salaries in 2016, according to the National Education Association.
The walkouts follow a two-week job action in West Virginia that prompted lawmakers to raise teachers' pay. Educators in Kentucky also staged demonstrations against years of stagnant or reduced budgets by a Republican-controlled legislature. Most returned to their classrooms or scheduled spring break holidays on Tuesday. Teachers in Arizona have threatened similar job actions.
In Tulsa, Frederick Smitherman, 48, who teaches eighth grade at Will Rogers Early College Junior High School, joined teachers, parents and students in a satellite protest on Tuesday.
""We all pay taxes and expect our legislators to do what we voted them in to do,"" Smitherman said. ""What else are teachers supposed to do besides yell and scream? We can vote them out but voting one out just brings a bad one in instead.""
Oklahoma's first major tax hike in a quarter century was approved by legislators last week and signed into law by Governor Mary Fallin - a $450 million revenue package intended to raise teachers' salaries by about $6,100 a year and avert a strike.
Teachers said that package wasn't good enough and demanded lawmakers reverse spending cuts that have forced some districts to impose four-day school weeks. The $200 million package they were lobbying for on Tuesday would increase hotel and capital gains taxes.
""Lawmakers have left significant funding on the table – funding that has bipartisan support but is being held up for political reasons,"" the Oklahoma Education Association, the state’s largest teachers union, said in a statement.
Oklahoma secondary school teachers had an annual mean wage of $42,460 as of May 2016, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The minimum salary for a first-year teacher was $31,600, state data showed.
American high school teachers are paid about two-thirds of what other professionals with college degrees earn, ahead of only the Slovak Republic and Czech Republic among 28 developed nations, according to a 2017 report by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which groups 35 industrialized countries.
The Oklahoma strikes on Monday coincided with a second day of walkouts by several thousand teachers in Kentucky after legislators there passed a bill imposing new limits on the state's underfunded public employee pension system.
Poppy Kelley, 47, a French teacher at Thomas Edison Preparatory High School in Tulsa with 23 years of teaching experience, said boosts in spending were needed for school facilities, books and supplies as well as teacher salaries.

""Oklahoma kids for a decade are so used to not having enough or having to make do that they don't know what 'enough' looks like,"" Kelley said. ""They want textbooks. They want chairs. They want tables that don't have a bent leg. They want proper technology in the classrooms.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn risked further souring his relationship with the Jewish community by attending a Passover event with a left-wing Jewish group that has called for the destruction of Israel.
Corbyn spent Monday evening at a ritual feast hosted by Jewdas, a group which described Israel in December as a ""steaming pile of sewage which needs to be properly disposed of"".
The group also called recent protests against Corbyn for failing to tackle anti-Semitism ""faux-outrage greased with hypocrisy and opportunism"". 
A spokesman for Corbyn, a supporter of Palestinian rights and a critic of Israel, said he attended the event in his London constituency in a personal capacity and not in his role as Labour leader.
""He wrote to the Board of Deputies and Jewish Leadership Council last week to ask for an urgent formal meeting to discuss tackling anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and in society,"" the spokesman added.
Jewdas did not respond to a request for comment.
Some opinions polls put Corbyn's Labour Party ahead or level with Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives, meaning he is a potential next British leader, although the next election is not due until 2022.
Since unexpectedly becoming Labour leader in 2015 after decades on the left-wing fringes of the party, Corbyn has repeatedly faced accusations of turning a blind eye to anti-Semitic comments in the party and among groups he supports.
Corbyn said on Tuesday there was no place for anti-Semitism in his party and that Labour would investigate any cases of suspected racism.
""Anti-Semitism is a vile, evil thing in our society.... and it has to be eradicated,"" he told reporters.
PROTEST
Last week, British Jewish groups protested against Corbyn outside parliament accusing him of failing to tackle anti-Semitism within Labour ranks.
The issue flared up two weeks ago after it came to light that in 2012 Corbyn questioned a decision by local London authorities to remove a street mural depicting men in suits with big noses playing Monopoly on the backs of naked people - an image reminiscent of anti-Semitic propaganda.
Some Labour lawmakers criticized Corbyn's decision to attend the event on Monday.
John Woodcock, a member of parliament who has criticized Corbyn in the past, said his attendance was ""irresponsible and dangerous"" and it was ""deliberately baiting the mainstream Jewish community days after they pleaded with him to tackle anti-Semitism"".
But Charlotte Nichols, one of the attendees of the Jewdas event, said Corbyn was right to attend the gathering.
""Many of last night's attendees are absolutely part of the 'mainstream community,'"" she wrote in a piece for the pro-Labour website LabourList. 
""It is untrue to say that there is any one narrative, political or otherwise, within Jewdas. It is a collective space where we can have uncomfortable conversations – what unites us all is the fact that we are Jewish.""
Jon Lansman, the leader of Momentum, a Corbyn-supporting grassroots movement that wants Labour to implement socialist policies such as wealth distribution, said the party needed to do more to tackle anti-Semitism.
""Jeremy is a lifelong anti-racist and I think it came as a something of a shock to him to be described as being some kind of racist, of harboring anti-Semitic people in the party that he now leads,"" Lansman told BBC radio.

""We need a widespread program of education and training within the Labour party about anti-Semitism in order to help people recognize the dangers of using certain words, language can be very sensitive and words often mean to other people something different from what they mean to you.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday he was cancelling an agreement with the U.N. refugee agency to relocate thousands of African migrants, bowing to right-wing pressure to scrap the deal.
The agency, the UNHCR, said it hoped Israel would reconsider the decision soon and offered to work with it to identify and ""respond to the protection needs"" of asylum seekers in the country.
Netanyahu's critics seized on his backtracking on the arrangement - under which thousands of other migrants would have won the right to remain in Israel - as a sign of political weakness. The prime minister is the subject of police investigations into suspected corruption, which he denies, in the greatest challenges to his career yet.
For the estimated 37,000 African migrants in Israel, most of them from Eritrea and Sudan, a whirlwind of announcements about their future has swept their status even deeper into limbo.
Outside a government complex in Tel Aviv where Netanyahu said he was scrapping the deal, several African men wrapped themselves in chains in a protest that put their sense of powerlessness on display.
On Monday Netanyahu announced live on television an arrangement with the UNHCR that would have relocated about 16,250 migrants to Western countries. 
But the fact that thousands more would be allowed to stay raised an outcry from right-wing politicians and on social media from Netanyahu's nationalist voter base, which wants the migrants expelled. He then posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) he was putting the agreement's implementation on hold.
By Tuesday, the deal was dead.
""I have listened carefully to the many comments on the agreement. As a result, and after I again weighed the advantages and disadvantages, I decided to cancel the deal,"" a statement from the prime minister's office quoted Netanyahu as saying.
He made the remarks at a meeting with representatives of residents of south Tel Aviv, a poor area that has attracted the largest migrant community and where many of its inhabitants want the Africans out.
The fate of migrants who entered Israel illegally by trekking across a desert border with Egypt, has posed a moral dilemma for a state founded as a haven for Jews from persecution and a national home.
In a joint statement, Israeli human rights groups condemned the decision to cancel the agreement, accusing Netanyahu of playing ""political games"". The groups said Israel is capable of absorbing all of the migrants, describing them as ""asylum-seekers who came knocking on its door"".
Before announcing the deal, Israel had been moving ahead with plans to deport many of the Africans to Rwanda. But the Supreme Court intervened, freezing such deportations in March, and Netanyahu said Rwanda had buckled to international pressure and reneged on the deal.

""Despite legal restraints and international difficulties that are piling up, we will continue to act with determination to explore all of the options at our disposal to remove the infiltrators,"" Netanyahu said in his statement on Tuesday.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The brother and sister of Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Tuesday that a ministerial panel's declarations about the future of a home lived in by their late father, the modern island state's founding father Lee Kuan Yew, were inaccurate.
In a sign that a family feud over the property may be far from over, they criticized a report published by the committee on Monday which laid out three options for the house: preserving it as a national monument, preserving part of it, or demolishing it.
Prime Minister Lee's younger brother, Lee Hsien Yang, who owns the property, and sister Lee Wei Ling, who still lives there, want the house to be eventually demolished in accordance with what they say were their father's wishes as stated in his will.
But the prime minister last year questioned whether his father really wanted the home at 38 Oxley Road, near Singapore's bustling Orchard Road shopping district, to be knocked down. He has said he has recused himself from government discussions on the matter.
""It is clear that our father was not endorsing alternatives to demolition,"" the siblings said in a joint statement on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). ""The Committee's statement does not accurately represent Lee Kuan Yew's wishes.""
The feud over the home gripped Singapore for at least a month last year, and included accusations by the prime minister's siblings that he was prepared to use the organs of the state against them. The accusations were denied by the prime minister.

The punishment will apply to both men and women in the ultra-conservative Muslim kingdom, according to a statement late on Monday by the ministry of culture. 
But it could tend to protect husbands from their wives.
As in many other parts of the Muslim world, Saudi laws on divorce, inspired by scripture, often require wives seeking alimony to provide evidence of abuse or sexual promiscuity. A husband's phone can be a rich source of such evidence.
Called the Anti-Cybercrime Law, the measure makes ""spying on, interception or reception of data transmitted through an information network or a computer without legitimate authorization"" a crime. It imposes a penalty up to 500,000 Saudi riyal ($133,000), prison or both.
""Social media has resulted in a steady increase in cybercrimes such as blackmail, embezzlement and defamation, not to mention hacking of accounts"", the ministry said.
A similar law on the books in the neighboring United Arab Emirates also bars the practice, carrying a minimum three-month prison term and 3,000 dirham ($817) fine.
The oil-rich and tech-obsessed countries are among the most avid social media users in the world, but traditional values remain ascendant, even in courts.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe faces a no- confidence motion on Wednesday that could go down to the wire and lead to political instability in the island nation, even if the government manages to scrape a win.
Wickremesinghe leads a national unity government in alliance with President Maithripala Sirisena's party, which has said it would vote against the prime minister, blaming him for failing to prevent an alleged scam in the bond market.
The opposition, which swept local elections last month, aims to drive a deeper wedge within the ruling coalition with the no-confidence motion and bring forward a national election due in 2020.
""There is common consensus in the party to vote in favor of the no-confidence motion,"" said Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, a minister of Sirisena's Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
""Clearly the SLFP is of the view that the prime minister should step down.""
Wickremesinghe has faced criticism for failing to deliver on economic growth which slumped to 3.1 percent last year, its worst pace since a recession in 2001. The rupee currency is hovering at a record low.
The government is also under pressure as it tries to manage China's expanding infrastructure push in Sri Lanka, located near key shipping lanes in the Indian Ocean, but which has raised fears that it could push the tiny country deep into debt.
Wickremesinghe's United National Party has 107 members in the 225-member parliament and, until now, the support of 42 members of the SLFP, which gave it a comfortable majority.
But if the SLFP votes against the government, Wickremesinghe could lose his majority. He would then need the backing of minority parties in the opposition to stay in office.
Eran Wickramaratne, the junior finance minister, said the UNP had asked for a quick vote ""to end any uncertainty people will have in their minds"" and hoped for a stronger government to emerge afterwards. 
Political instability is weighing on the economy, he said.
""You are not going to get 6-percent-plus kind of growth because of the political issues. We will move into 4-percent-plus in 2018,"" he told Reuters.
The yields on Sri Lanka’s benchmark bonds have risen 83 basis points since early this year, and the central bank chief has also warned of risks to economic growth from political instability.
POPULISM WILL RISE
Shailesh Kumar, Asian director at consultancy Eurasia group, foresaw limited cooperation between the UNP and the SLFP after the no-confidence motion, even if the prime minister survived.
""This means there will be limited appetite for economic legislation and instead the two will likely indulge in populism to shore up their positions ahead of the 2020 elections,"" he told Reuters.
Foreign direct investments (FDI) doubled to $1.6 billion last year, but more than 40 percent of that was from China, for two key projects that have dragged on for more than a year.

A trade pact signed with Singapore in January and expected free trade agreements with China and India later this year are seen boosting Sri Lanka's export revenue through new FDIs. But officials of the Board of Investment say investors have been waiting for clarity on the political front.

39,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 05:42AM ET</span>",German prosecutors file for extradition of ex-Catalan leader Puigdemont,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German prosecutors filed a request to a regional court on Tuesday for the extradition of former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont to Spain, where he faces charges of rebellion over the region's campaign for independence.
Puigdemont has been held in a detention center in the northern German town of Neumuenster for just over a week after he was arrested in Germany on March 25.
Prosecutors in the state of Schleswig-Holstein said Spain's extradition request was admissible because accusations of rebellion included carrying out an anti-constitutional referendum even though violent clashes could be expected.
""This has a comparable equivalent in German law,"" said the prosecutors in a statement.
Prosecutors also asked the Higher Regional Court in Schleswig-Holstein, which will decide on the extradition, to keep Puigdemont in prison during the proceedings because there was a danger he would try to escape. 
Puigdemont fled Spain five months ago for Belgium after Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dismissed his regional administration and imposed direct rule from Madrid. 
The charges he faces over the organizing of an illegal secession referendum could lead to 25 years behind bars.
The German government has insisted Puigdemont's extradition is a matter for the courts, even though last week his German lawyer Wolfgang Schomburg said he would also be looking to the German government in his attempts to get the ex-Catalan leader freed. The justice minister is entitled to veto any extradition. 
Prosecutors also said the Spanish accusation of misuse of public money - for carrying out an unconstitutional referendum - also had an equivalent in German law. 
On Monday, Puigdemont appealed against the charge of rebellion in Spain's Supreme Court, saying he did not commit any acts of violence to justify this. He also appealed against the charge of mis-use of public funds. 
It is unclear when the German court will make its decision.
The Spanish court aims to try a total of 25 Catalan leaders for rebellion and other charges. International arrest warrants are active against four other politicians who fled abroad last year, including Carla Ponsati, a former Catalan education minister who is fighting extradition from her home in Scotalnd. 
Five separatist leaders are in jail in Spain pending trial. They all deny any wrongdoing.

The Catalans say they will not get a fair trial in Spain and are being prosecuted for their political beliefs. Spain denies this and says their actions violated the Spanish constitution.

BEIRUT/AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian rebels in a besieged area northeast of Damascus have been told they must accept state rule or leave, a rebel group said on Tuesday, as the government and its Russian ally seek to wipe out the last pockets of opposition territory near the capital.
The ultimatum to the rebels of eastern Qalamoun was served to civilians from the area during a meeting with a Russian colonel and an officer from the Syrian Air Force Intelligence, rebel spokesman Said Saif of the Martyr Ahmad Abdo told Reuters.
The area is 40 km (25 miles) from Damascus and separate from eastern Ghouta - an area right next to the capital where government forces have routed rebels in recent weeks, forcing thousands to accept safe passage out towards the Turkish border.
An opposition source said talks over the densely-populated town of Douma, the last rebel pocket of eastern Ghouta, had yet to be concluded, at odds with state media reports that the group holed up inside - Jaish al-Islam - had accepted a deal to leave.
President Bashar al-Assad, his military position secure thanks to Russia and Iran, is seeking to crush the last pockets of opposition to his rule near the main cities of western Syria.
The rebel enclave in eastern Qalamoun includes several towns and a barren expanse of mountainous territory.
""A clear message was sent to the Free Syrian Army (FSA) groups in the area: either reconciliation and disarmament - handing weapons to the Syrian government as the Russians describe it - or departing eastern Qalamoun,"" Saif said in separate comments to al-Hadath TV.
Saif said rebels had made a proposal under which they would withdraw from the towns into the mountains and civilians would stay, and Russia's response was being awaited. He said the aim was to avoid the ""forced displacement"" of people that had occurred in other areas recovered by the Syrian government. 
The Syrian military could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Saif told Reuters the civilians who met the Russian and Syrian military officers had expressed concern that a departure of rebel fighters would leave them vulnerable to attack by jihadists from Nusra Front or Islamic State.
DOUMA DEADLOCK?
The Syrian war last month entered its eighth year having killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced 11 million from their homes, including nearly 6 million who have fled abroad in one of the worst refugee crises of modern times.
While Assad now controls the single largest chunk of Syria, it may prove difficult for him to regain much more territory without colliding with the interests of foreign states, notably Turkey and the United States which have forces in the country. 
Russian-backed government forces have recovered nearly all of eastern Ghouta in a ferocious assault that began in February. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says bombardment of the rebel enclave killed more than 1,600 civilians in Ghouta.
It marks Assad's most significant victory over the rebellion against his rule since rebels were driven from eastern Aleppo in 2016.
State media has said Jaish al-Islam had accepted a deal giving its fighters safe passage to towns at the border with Turkey that are located in a buffer zone controlled by the Turkish military and allied Syrian rebel groups.
But while Russia's defence ministry said 2,000 had left since April 1, the opposition source familiar with the negotiations said no final deal had been reached with Jaish al-Islam.
The group, which is estimated to have many thousands of fighters, has previously insisted it will not leave Douma or accept ""forced displacement"" to another part of Syria.
The source said that while Jaish al-Islam wanted to stay in the town, it was not seeking its own ""independent canton"". People in Douma wanted a reconciliation deal with the state that keeps out its feared security services, the source added.
A military source told Reuters on Monday that some elements of Jaish al-Islam were still rejecting a deal and that military force would be used if they refused to strike one.
The source said on Tuesday the government had set a deadline for militants to leave Douma, without saying how long.
""The Syrian government has taken a decision to clear militants from the areas,"" the source told Reuters.

KUNDUZ, Afghanistan/KABUL (Reuters) - Villagers in the northern Afghan province of Kunduz said they had buried dozens of victims of an air strike on a Taliban controlled district, in an incident the United Nations described as ""disturbing.""
The event underlined the risks of greater use of air power under a new U.S. strategy announced last year to try to force the militant group to the negotiating table. 
Sayed Jaan, a resident of the district of Dasht-i Archi, said he participated in two mass funerals of almost 40 people, adding that others followed Monday's bombing by the Afghan Air Force (AAF).
He said the helicopter attack happened during a religious ceremony, called Dastaar Bandi, to mark young men completing the memorization of the Koran, the Muslim holy book. 
""There were two mass graves to bury the victims of the bombing and I took part in both burials. In one grave, 16, and in another, 21. Many were young children,"" Sayed Jaan said on Tuesday.
""There were other burials and people were digging graves.""
The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said in a tweet its investigators were in the area looking into ""disturbing reports of serious harm"" to civilians. 
A senior official of Afghanistan's defense ministry said the air attack happened during a meeting of militants, and killed at least 35 Taliban and wounded many more, but he denied reports that civilians were harmed. Two senior Taliban commanders were among those killed, the official said. 
Kunduz city was seized briefly by the Taliban in 2015 and was overrun by the militants for a second time the following year but has since been considered relatively secure. However the Taliban controls much of the surrounding province, with government ground forces unable to reach many areas.
A video posted online by the Taliban showed at least four bodies of children, wrapped in white shrouds. Other images circulated of children and adults being treated in hospital for injuries, but they could not be verified.
Building up the fledgling AAF has been a major priority for the NATO-led Resolute Support training and advisory mission.
On Monday, the Taliban said the strike killed 150 religious scholars and civilians and denied the presence of any of its forces.
Last year, more than 10,000 civilians died or suffered injuries in Afghanistan over the war between its Western-backed government and militant groups, down 9 percent from the previous year, a UNAMA report showed in February.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The United States placed Pakistan's Milli Muslim League political party on its list of foreign terrorist organizations on Monday, linking it with militants that the United States and India blame for the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people.
Controlled by Islamist leader Hafiz Saeed, who has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head, the Milli Muslim League shot to prominence after fielding a candidate in a September 2017 by-election to fill a seat vacated by deposed Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif.
Saeed is the founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), or Army of the Pure, which is also on the U.S. terrorist list and blamed by the United States and India for four days of shootings and bombings in Mumbai in 2008.
Saeed has repeatedly denied involvement in the attacks.
""These designations seek to deny LeT the resources it needs to plan and carry out further terrorist attacks,"" the State Department said in a statement.
""Make no mistake: whatever LeT chooses to call itself, it remains a violent terrorist group. The United States supports all efforts to ensure that LeT does not have a political voice until it gives up violence as a tool of influence,"" the statement added. 
Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to request for comment. 
In October 2017, Pakistan's electoral commission barred the Milli Muslim League from contesting elections, saying the party had links with militant groups and could not be registered with the commission. 
In March 2018 the Islamabad High Court ordered the election commission register the party. 
Under pressure from the United States, the United Nations and international institutions to crack down on terrorist financing, Pakistan drew up secret plans last December for a ""takeover"" of charities linked to Saeed.
Saeed has since taken the government decision to court. 
Saeed was placed under house arrest in January 2017 after years of living freely in Pakistan but a court ordered his release in November 2017.
Saeed's freedom in Pakistan, where he holds public rallies, has been a thorn in Islamabad's relations with India and the United States.

HANOI (Reuters) - Tension in the South China Sea will hurt PetroVietnam's offshore exploration and exploitation activities this year, the state-run oil and gas group said on Tuesday, weeks after the Southeast Asian nation suspended a project under pressure from China.
Vietnam and China have been embroiled in maritime disputes in parts of the busy waterway, where China claims 90 percent of the potentially energy-rich maritime territory, which Vietnam calls the East Sea.
""The East Sea is forecast to continue to have uncertainty this year ... affecting the company's efforts to attract foreign investors to invest in its open offshore fields"", PetroVietnam said on its website.
PetroVietnam has rarely openly admitted that the tension has had an adverse impact on its offshore exploration and production fields, especially those located near the U-shaped ""nine-dash line"" that marks the vast area claimed by China.
During a trip to Hanoi on Sunday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said both nations should settle their disputes in the South China Sea through talks and move to jointly use its waters.
The two countries had agreed such a move was ""extremely important for the healthy and sustainable development of bilateral relations,"" Wang said.
In its statement, PetroVietnam said the dispute with China would add to its struggle to maintain crude oil output amid already declining production from Vietnam's key fields.
Last month, it ordered Spanish energy firm Repsol (MC:REP) to suspend its ""Red Emperor"" project off Vietnam's southeastern coast following pressure from China, sources told Reuters.
The $1-billion ""Red Emperor"" field is of moderate size by international standards but was seen as a key asset to help slow the decline of Vietnam's stalling oil and gas production.
But the block lies near China's ""nine-dash line"" and overlaps what it says are its own oil concessions.

Vietnam's crude oil output this year is expected to fall 14.7 percent from last year to 11.31 million metric tonnes, or 227,130 barrels per day, the government has said.

Quetta, Pakistan (Reuters) - The militant group Islamic State on Tuesday claimed responsibility for killing four members of a Christian family in southwestern Pakistan. 
A statement issued by the group claimed that militants belonging to ISIS fired on the group of Christians as they were traveling in the city of Quetta, killing four on Monday.
Islamic State has affiliates in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, many drawn from existing Islamist militant groups, who support their vehement sectarian views against Shi'ite Muslims and non-Muslims.
The family was traveling in a rickshaw when armed men on a motorcycle intercepted them and opened fire in Quetta city, the capital of Baluchistan province.
The family had come to visit relatives in Quetta's Shahzaman road area, where a large number of the city's Christian community lives.
""It appears to have been a targeted attack,"" provincial police official Moazzam Jah Ansari told Reuters. ""It was an act of terrorism.""
The attack came a day after Pakistan's Christian community celebrated Easter on Sunday. Around 2 percent of Pakistan's population of 208 million are Christians.
Minority religious festivals are a security concern in the majority Sunni Muslim country where there have been a number of high casualty attacks on Christians and Shi'ite Muslims.
Baluchistan, a region bordering Iran as well as Afghanistan, is plagued by violence by Sunni Islamist groups linked to the Taliban, al Qaeda and Islamic State.
It also has an indigenous ethnic Baloch insurgency fighting against central government.
In December, a week before Christmas, two suicide bombers stormed a packed Christian church in southwestern Pakistan, killing at least 10 people and wounding up to 56, in an attack claimed by Islamic State.

49,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 02:40AM ET</span>","Malaysia's Najib expected to call election on Friday, minister says","KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is expected to announce the dissolution of parliament on Friday, a government minister said, paving way for what is expected to be the toughest ever general election for his long-ruling coalition.
Najib is under pressure to secure a strong mandate as he grapples with a multi-billion dollar scandal at a state fund and public anger over rising living costs.
To do so, he must fend off an unprecedented challenge from his old mentor, former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad.
The prime minister will likely dissolve parliament on Friday after he chairs a weekly cabinet meeting, Abdul Rahman Dahlan, the minister in charge of the economic planning unit, said on Tuesday.
""I think it's Friday, probably ... traditionally we'll have our manifesto launch after parliament dissolution, so the manifesto is going to be launched this Saturday,"" he told Reuters.
The dissolution of parliament paves the way for a general election. The date of the vote will be announced by the Election Commission after the dissolution of parliament.
The New Straits Times newspaper cited unidentified sources as saying preparations were underway for Najib to call the election after Friday prayers this week.
Najib's United Malay National Organization party has led every multi-ethnic coalition since Malaysia emerged from British colonial rule in 1957.
Najib only narrowly won the last election in 2013 after losing the popular vote to an opposition bloc, now led by Mahathir, who is 92.
Mahathir has emerged as Najib's fiercest critic over his handling of a scandal surrounding losses at the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), a state investment firm.
Najib has denied wrongdoing.
A general election must be held by August.
The opposition has complained that two recent steps backed by the government will boost Najib's chances at the polls.
Last week, parliament approved a plan to redraw constituency boundaries for more than a third of its seats, changes that critics say will help Najib.

On Monday, parliament passed a bill outlawing fake news and setting jail of up to six years for violators.

A separatist group, however, said that only one of its members had died and that dozens of Indonesian troops were killed in clashes that began on Sunday.
Papua has suffered a simmering separatist conflict since it was incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticized U.N.-backed referendum in 1969 and foreign media access to parts of the province is often difficult or, at times, restricted. 
Papua Military spokesman Muhammad Aidi said the soldier was killed during a joint military and police operation to ""reclaim villages controlled by armed criminal separatists"".
""It appears (the separatists) were ready for the security forces and so there was a gun fight with the military,"" Aidi said in a statement.
Six villages were still occupied by separatists and indigenous Papuans after more than 1,000 residents were evacuated in November following a string of shootings, he said.
Drone footage showed two separatists were killed and dozens wounded in the clash, he said. No civilians were hurt, but separatists torched a house, a school and a hospital, said Aidi.
According to the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB), a separatist group, one of its members was shot dead in a clash with Indonesian special forces near Banti village early on Sunday morning.
Hendrikus Uwamang, a spokesman for the group, said at least 28 Indonesian security personnel and several guides were also killed in the clash. Fighting continued on Monday and a 10-year-old boy was also killed, when his house was hit by a shell and caught fire, he said.
Papua Police chief Boy Rafli Amar was quoted in state media last week as saying attacks by ""armed criminals"" had become more frequent lately near the Grasberg mine. Amar could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.Members of Indonesia's security forces have been accused by rights activists of abducting and torturing Papuans and using deadly force to quell protests. 
TPNPB, which is linked to the Free Papua Movement (OPM), says it is at war with Indonesian authorities and wants to ""destroy"" Freeport in an effort to gain sovereignty for the region. 
President Joko Widodo, after coming to power in 2014, had pledged to speed up development of Papua and ease media restrictions. 
But while investment has risen and efforts made to address some human rights concerns, activists say foreign journalists continue to be blocked or face obstacles when trying to report there.
Jakarta is currently in talks with Freeport over ownership of Grasberg, and hopes to gain a majority stake in the world's second-biggest copper mine this month, with the Papua government and a local regency jointly gaining rights to a 10 percent stake.

Police said 700 kilograms (1,543 lbs) of the drug, known as ice, was seized on March 28 in southern Chumpon Province and were destined for Malaysia.
The drugs were produced in the Golden Triangle region, where the borders of Thailand, Myanmar and Laos meet. Two Thais and two Malaysians were arrested in connection with the bust.
The methamphetamine market has expanded at an alarming rate in East and Southeast Asia. In 2015, experts in several countries in the subregion reported an increase in the use of both crystalline methamphetamine and methamphetamine tablets.
Among amphetamines, methamphetamine represents the greatest global health threat, a 2017 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) World Drug report said.
""These big seizures are indications that there is a relentless supply pumping out of the Golden Triangle and north Shan to flood Southeast Asian markets and also transit Southeast Asia to high value markets like Australia, New Zealand and potentially further,"" Jeremy Douglas, the UNODC's chief in Southeast Asia, told Reuters.
Police displayed the haul on Tuesday at a government compound north of Bangkok. Other drugs on display included 890 million baht ($28.51 million) worth of illicit drugs, including cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy, seized in various busts between March 25 and April 1. 
Most of the drugs were produced outside of Thailand and were trafficked through the country en route to Australia, North America and Europe.
""The prices we announced are the values in Thailand,"" Police Lieutenant General Sommai Kongvisaisuk, commander of the Narcotics Suppression Bureau, told reporters.
""Once the drugs pass through Thailand the prices will increase,"" Sommai said, adding that disruptions to supply chains has done little to stall production.
""We have intercepted a lot of drugs over the past year ... but the production capacity remains untouched.""

The boat had stopped at an island in southern Thailand on Saturday after a storm, with officials there saying the refugees were heading to Malaysia. It had set sail from central Rakhine state in Myanmar, the U.N. refugee agency said. 
""Generally all 56 passengers, mostly children and women, are safe but tired and hungry,"" Malaysian navy chief Admiral Ahmad Kamarulzaman Ahmad Badaruddin told Reuters.
""We have provided them with water, food and other humanitarian assistance.""
According to UN and other rights groups, some 700,000 mostly Muslim Rohingya fled their homes in Rakhine into Bangladesh after militant attacks in August last year sparked a military crackdown that the United Nations and Western countries have said constitutes ethnic cleansing.
Buddhist-majority Myanmar rejects that charge, saying its forces have been waging a legitimate campaign against ""terrorists"" who attacked government forces.
Tens of thousands of Rohingya fled Myanmar by sea following an outbreak of sectarian violence in Rakhine in 2012, some falling prey to human traffickers. That exodus peaked in 2015, when an estimated 25,000 people fled across the Andaman Sea for Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, many drowning in unsafe and overloaded boats.
Due to the fresh outbreak of violence in Myanmar, rights groups expect another surge in Rohingya boats reaching Southeast Asia, during the months the seas are calmer, even if not at the levels of three years ago.
Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency Director General Zulkifili Abu Bakar said the refugees would be allowed to enter the country on humanitarian grounds. 
""They will be handed over to the Immigration Department,"" he told Reuters in a text message. 
Muslim-majority Malaysia, which has not signed the U.N. Refugee Convention and treats refugees as illegal migrants, is already home to more than 100,000 Rohingya refugees.

54,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 02:11AM ET</span>","As China tightens squeeze, soul searching for Hong Kong's democracy movement","By Venus Wu and James Pomfret
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's once thriving pro-democracy movement, weighed down by growing pessimism among its supporters over China's ever-increasing control in the city, is facing a crisis of confidence about its future.
As China tightens its grip on Hong Kong, pro-democracy parties have been hit by the sidelining of key leaders and have been losing ground to a well-organized pro-Beijing camp.
Those troubles hit home last month, when the democrats suffered an electoral setback in a key legislative by-election, winning only two of three seats they were expected to take easily.
Critically, many supporters stayed home – and some switched sides to protest what they said were the confrontational tactics of pro-democracy groups.
""The opposition always argues for the sake of argument,"" said one democracy supporter who gave her name as Feng. In frustration, she cast her ballot for a pro-Beijing candidate in the March 11 elections.
""Confronting Beijing directly is not a good strategy,"" the 44-year-old government contractor said. ""You have to go about it in softer ways."" She said she did not want her full name published because she works for the government.
That sort of shift by voters like Feng is worrying leaders of pro-democracy parties in Hong Kong who fear an eroding public mandate, which they see as their sole weapon to counter Beijing's influence in the city.
""We have to make sure that our own people here in Hong Kong do not give up on us,"" said Alvin Yeung, a barrister and head of the pro-democracy Civic Party.
Over the past decade, resentment has deepened toward China's perceived growing encroachment on Hong Kong's autonomy.
In 2014, protests by pro-democrats calling for a greater say in how Hong Kong's leader was chosen engulfed large areas of the city for months. The collapse of those protests led to growing calls among young activists for independence.
The Chinese government has responded with an increasingly tougher line.
In 2016, it intervened in a Hong Kong court decision that removed pro-independence lawmakers from office for taking their oaths improperly – the action that led to the March by-elections. It has also deemed a Hong Kong train station to be under mainland authority.
On Tuesday, dozens of pro-Beijing groups took out advertisements in Hong Kong newspapers calling for the dismissal of a University of Hong Kong academic, Benny Tai, after he allegedly made comments advocating independence for China.
The growing reach of China's security apparatus is also worrying many in Hong Kong after instances like the 2015 disappearance of several Hong Kong booksellers who later showed up in Chinese custody, as well as the mysterious disappearance of a mainland Chinese tycoon from a luxury hotel in 2017. 
Hong Kong authorities, meanwhile, have proposed jail terms of up to three years for those mocking China's national anthem, and there have been calls from pro-Beijing politicians for national security laws outlawing subversive acts against China.
The authorities have also started jailing protest leaders like Joshua Wong, a 21-year-old student.
FALLING TURNOUT
The loss of the legislative seat last month was the first time that the pro-democracy camp had lost a head-to-head contest in a by-election, a significant defeat as it meant that the opposition failed to regain some veto powers. 
The democrats will be vying for an additional two seats in by-elections whose dates have yet to be announced.
In addition to growing discontent over the democratic movement's direction, some voters have expressed concerns about a lack of charismatic candidates, as well as public infighting within the democratic camp.
Ben Wong, a 45-year-old office worker, said he was only voting against the establishment when he cast his ballot for Edward Yiu, a democratic candidate with whom who he felt little affinity.
""I was voting in distaste,"" he said. Yiu was the candidate who failed to take back his seat.
While by-elections generally attract fewer voters, pro-democracy parties saw their number of votes in the three contested districts fall 35 percent when compared to the full election two years ago. In contrast, the pro-Beijing camp saw votes drop 12 percent.
Crystal So, a 26-year-old club DJ, was one democracy supporter who said she did not bother to vote.
    ""I feel like Hong Kong is not a place to call home anymore,"" So said in a text message. She added that some people her age were considering moving to other countries. The jailing of Wong, who she said was ""doing the bravest things compared to a lot of us"", hit her particularly hard.
Wong, who is out on bail, told Reuters he believes Hong Kong will not be able to achieve genuine democracy in the short term. But he said it was important to defend Hong Kong's core values.
""You need to build a foundation, so when the critical moment comes, you would have bargaining power,"" Wong said of Hong Kong's democratic movement.
For the democrats, the next big tests will be possible by-elections ahead of local district council elections in 2019 and Legislative Council elections in 2020.
Joseph Cheng, a retired academic who advises the democrats, said he believes the moment has arrived for the camp to dive into ""some serious soul searching"".
""Not only do we have our own troubles, but we face an opposition machine that is now exceptionally sophisticated,"" he added.
CHINA'S SQUEEZE 
The pro-establishment camp is backed by the United Front, a Chinese Communist Party-linked group that mobilizes supporters through social groups and business associations, according to scholars and diplomats.
The democrats, by contrast, lack a clear central leadership to unite a broad spectrum of supporters.
Funding is also an issue for the pro-democracy parties. Jimmy Lai, the founder of the NextMedia group, remains a significant funder of the movement, which gets positive coverage in his mass market Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily newspaper. Lai could not be reached for comment.
But they have struggled to raise money from other large companies, who may fear retribution from China, and rely on small donations from individuals.
Pro-Beijing parties, by contrast, have an easier time raising money.
The largest, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, in 2016 fetched HK$18.8 million ($2.40 million) from auctioning off calligraphy by the top Beijing official in Hong Kong, according to local media.
""THE POLITICAL GAME""
When asked about the United Front's influence, Regina Ip, a prominent pro-Beijing lawmaker, acknowledged that some supporters of her New People's Party with roots in the mainland might talk to Chinese officials.
But Ip also stressed the hard work of her party, saying it mobilized about 1,000 volunteers to hit the streets and talk to voters face-to-face before the by-election.
""You cannot win by just flying a democracy flag,"" Ip said. She said the pro-democracy parties were dependent ""on their old tactics of just relying on the appeal of democracy or stirring up anger against the government."" She added: ""Clearly these days these tactics are not good enough.""

55,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 12:00PM ET</span>",Migrant caravan heading to U.S. border puts Mexico in tough spot with Trump,"By Delphine Schrank and Mica Rosenberg
IXTEPEC, Mexico/EDINBURG, Texas (Reuters) - In some of the Mexican towns playing host to a ""caravan"" of more than 1,200 Central American migrants heading to the U.S. border, the welcome mat has been rolled out despite President Donald Trump's call for Mexican authorities to stop them.
Local officials have offered lodging in town squares and empty warehouses or arranged transport for the migrants, participants in a journey organized by the immigrant advocacy group Pueblo Sin Fronteras. The officials have conscripted buses, cars, ambulances and police trucks. But the help may not be entirely altruistic.
""The authorities want us to leave their cities,"" said Rodrigo Abeja, an organizer from Pueblo Sin Fronteras. ""They've been helping us, in part to speed the massive group out of their jurisdictions.""
At some point this spring, the caravan's 2,000-mile (3,200-km) journey that began at Tapachula near the Guatemalan border on March 25 will end at the U.S. border, where some of its members will apply for asylum, while others will attempt to sneak into the United States.
Abeja said there was a lot of pressure from authorities to stop the caravan ""because of Donald Trump's reaction."" The Mexican government issued a statement late on Monday saying it was committed to ""legal and orderly"" migration.
The government said the caravan had been taking place since 2010 and was largely made up of Central Americans entering Mexico who had not met the necessary legal requirements.
""For this reason, participants in this (caravan) are subject to an administrative migratory procedure, while 400 have already been repatriated to their countries of origin, in strict accordance with the law and respecting their human rights,"" it said.
Those without permission to stay in Mexico or who had failed to request it through the proper channels could expect to be returned to their homelands, a government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
'DOING LITTLE'
Trump railed on Twitter against the caravan on Monday, accusing Mexico of ""doing very little, if not NOTHING"" to stop the flow of immigrants crossing the U.S. border illegally. ""They must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA,"" he concluded.
Mexico's interior minister Alfonso Navarrete did not directly address the caravan, but he wrote on Twitter that he spoke to the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Monday, and that the two had ""agreed to analyze the best ways to attend to the flows of migrants in accordance with the laws of each country."" 
Mexico must walk a delicate line with the United States because the countries are in the midst of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) along with Canada.
At the same time, Mexican left-wing presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has an 18-point lead ahead of the July 1 election, according to a poll published on Monday.
A Lopez Obrador victory could usher in a Mexican government less accommodating toward the United States on both trade and immigration issues. 
Mexican Senator Angelica de la Pena, who presides over the Senate's human rights commission, told Reuters that Mexico should protect migrants' rights despite the pressure from Trump.  
Former President Vicente Fox called for Mexican officials to take a stand against Trump's attacks. Trump keeps ""blackmailing, offending and denigrating Mexico and Mexicans,"" he wrote on Twitter on Monday.
Under Mexican law, Central Americans who enter Mexico legally are generally allowed to move freely through the country, even if their goal is to cross illegally into the United States. 
'WE'RE SUFFERING’
Migrants in the caravan cite a variety of reasons for joining it. Its members are disproportionately from Honduras, which has high levels of violence and has been rocked by political upheaval in recent months following the re-election of U.S.-backed president, Juan Orlando Hernández, in an intensely disputed election. 
Maria Elena Colindres Ortega, a member of the caravan and, until January, a member of Congress in Honduras, said she is fleeing the political upheaval at home. ""We've had to live through a fraudulent electoral process,"" she said. ""We’re suffering a progressive militarization and lack of institutions, and ... they're criminalizing those who protested."" 
Colindres Ortega, who opposed the ruling party in Honduras, said she spiraled into debt after serving without pay for the last 18 months of her four-year term. She decided to head north after a fellow congressman from her party put out word on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that a caravan of migrants was gathering in southern Mexico, leaving home with a small bag with necessities and photos of her children. 
Pueblo Sin Fronteras has helped coordinate migrant caravans for the past several years, although previously they had a maximum of several hundred participants. During the journey members of the organization instruct the migrants about their rights.
""We accompany at least those who want to request asylum,"" said Alex Mensing, Pueblo Sin Fronteras' program director. ""We help prepare them for the detention process and asylum process before they cross the border, because it's so difficult for people to have success if they don't have the information."" 
Typically, Central Americans have not fared well with U.S. asylum claims, particularly those from Honduras. A Reuters analysis of immigration court data found that Hondurans who come before the court receive deportation orders in more than 83 percent of cases, the highest rate of any nationality. Hondurans also face deportation in Mexico, where immigration data shows that 5,000 Hondurans were deported from Mexico in February alone, the highest number since May 2016.
Manuel Padilla, chief of the border patrol's Rio Grande Valley sector, one of the busiest crossing points on the U.S. Mexico border, said in an interview with Reuters that he worries the caravan could ""generate interest for other groups to do the same thing,"" but he was not terribly nervous about coping with the group currently traveling.
""Not to be flippant,"" Padilla said, ""but it's similar numbers to what we are seeing every day pretty much.""

56,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>","Four detained in Indonesia's Aceh for alleged gay sex, face 100 lashes","BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (Reuters) - Rights activists called on Tuesday for Indonesia's Aceh province to release four people detained on suspicion of having homosexual sex, amid concerns over the persecution of the LGBT community in the world's third-largest democracy.
Secular Indonesia is predominantly Muslim but ultra-conservative Aceh is the only province to follow sharia, or Islamic law, and criminalize gay sex. 
Indonesia's parliament is currently debating revisions to the national criminal code that could criminalize all sex outside marriage, including same-sex relations. Many believe the new rules could be used to unfairly target the LGBT community and other minority groups.
Authorities said the four suspects were rounded up by vigilantes and police and, if convicted, could face up to 100 lashes in public.
""We are completing their files and will soon hand over to prosecutors,"" said Marzuki, head of sharia police investigations in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh. 
Human Rights Watch said the punishment ""constitutes torture under international human rights law"".
""Acehnese authorities should release the four and protect the public from marauding vigilantes who target vulnerable minorities,"" said Graeme Reid, director of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights program at Human Rights Watch. 
The provincial and central governments drew international condemnation last year when, for the first time, Aceh authorities publicly caned two men who were convicted under the province's anti-homosexuality laws, which were introduced in 2014. 
Vigilantes and religious police in Aceh often raid homes and places of work and detain people on suspicion of engaging in homosexual activity.
Aceh police detained 12 transgender women earlier this year and publicly shamed them by forcing them to cut their hair and dress in ""masculine"" clothing.
They were later released without charge, but activists say many have since gone into hiding for fear of further raids.

57,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>",Dismissal call piles pressure on Hong Kong academic over independence remarks,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Pressure is mounting on a Hong Kong academic who helped lead pro-democracy protests in 2014, as dozens of pro-Beijing groups ran newspaper advertisements on Tuesday to demand his dismissal for allegedly advocating independence from China.
The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a so-called ""one country, two systems"" formula that guarantees it a high degree of autonomy and far greater freedoms than exist on the mainland.
Beijing, which considers the freewheeling financial hub an ""inalienable"" part of China, has been extremely critical of recent calls by more radical activists for greater self-determination for Hong Kong, and even outright independence. 
Comments by law professor Benny Tai at a forum in Taiwan last month drew the ire of the People's Daily, China's mouthpiece newspaper, which urged Hong Kong authorities on Monday to take legal action against him under existing laws.
The Hong Kong government also condemned Tai, saying in a statement it was ""shocked by the remarks made by a university teaching staff member that Hong Kong could consider becoming an independent state"".
The latest salvo came from the Federation of Hong Kong Shenzhen Associations, a pro-Beijing group of nearly 70 bodies, which took out full-page advertisements in several newspapers, including the pro-Beijing Ta Kung Pao.
In the advertisements, the federation, backed by 68 clan and patriotic groups and businesses, urged Tai's employer, the University of Hong Kong, to fire him immediately. 
It also called for independence advocates to be ""legally regulated"".
It gave no specifics, but the call adds to a growing clamor from pro-Beijing voices in the city for harsher national security laws to tighten regulation of those advocating independence as a possible ""subversive"" act against China.
Tai did not immediately respond to telephone calls from Reuters to seek comment.
Tai told Hong Kong's public broadcaster RTHK he had the right to free speech, and his comments were taken out of context.
He said he did not support independence for Hong Kong, and had only been speaking hypothetically that Hong Kong might consider becoming independent, should China one day become democratic.

Pro-democracy politicians and a group of liberal academics also condemned the criticism against Tai, saying Hong Kong's laws grant any individual the freedom to comment on political matters, even independence.

China has traditionally been secretive North Korea's closest ally but ties have been frayed by Kim's pursuit of nuclear weapons and missiles and Beijing's backing of tough U.N. sanctions in response.
Wang, a State Councillor and China's Foreign Minister, said there had been positive changes on the peninsula and that all sides were engaging in ""sincere exchanges"".
""China hopes all sides can cherish this hard to come by situation, maintain the momentum of contact and dialogue, and create conditions to smoothly restart dialogue,"" Wang said during a joint news briefing with visiting Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis.
Wang said he hoped the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump would ""increase mutual understanding"".
""But historical experience tells us that at the moment of easing of the situation on the peninsula and as first light dawns on peace and dialogue, frequently all manner of disruptive factors emerge,"" Wang said.
""So we call on all sides to maintain focus, eliminate interference, and firmly follow the correct path of dialogue and negotiation.""
Cassis said that he would discuss with Wang the role that Switzerland could play in the strategic meetings between Kim and ""some important partners on the international level"", but he did not elaborate. 
Kim pledged his commitment to denuclearization and to meet U.S. officials, China said last month after his meeting in Beijing with President Xi Jinping.
He is scheduled to meet Trump in May to discuss denuclearization, although a time and place have not been set. North and South Korea will hold their first summit in more than a decade on April 27, South Korea has said.
Kim's predecessors, grandfather Kim Il Sung and father Kim Jong Il, both promised not to pursue nuclear weapons but secretly maintained programs to develop them, culminating in the North's first nuclear test in 2006 under Kim Jong Il.
North Korea has said in previous, failed talks aimed at dismantling its nuclear program it could consider giving up its arsenal if the United States removed its troops from South Korea and withdrew its so-called nuclear umbrella of deterrence from South Korea and Japan.
China had largely sat on the sidelines as North Korea improved relations with South Korea recently, raising worries in Beijing that it was no longer a central player in the North Korean issue, reinforced by Trump's announcement of his proposed meeting with Kim.
The two Koreas have seen a significant thaw in relations since the North's participation in the South's Winter Olympics in February. 
Kim Jong Un proposed another concert in South Korea later this year with performers from the North in response to this week's shows in Pyongyang by K-pop artists, South Korea's Culture Minister Do Jong-whan told reporters in Seoul.
Kim and his wife on Sunday made a surprise appearance at the first of two concerts performed by the South Korean art troupe this week in Pyongyang, titled ""Spring is Coming"". 

It was the first time a North Korean leader had attended a South Korean performance in the capital.

59,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 11:20PM ET</span>","Taiwan, China spar over Taiwan premier's independence remarks","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's government said on Tuesday that China was stirring up its media to threaten the self-ruled island after a major state-run newspaper said China should issue an international arrest warrant for Taiwan's premier for his comments on independence.
Taiwan is one of China's most sensitive issues. The island is claimed by Beijing as its sacred territory and China has never renounced the use of force to bring under Chinese control what it considers to be a wayward province.
China's hostility to Taiwan has grown since Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party was elected Taiwanese president in 2016. China fears she wants to push for formal independence, though Tsai says she wants to maintain the status quo and is committed to peace.
After Taiwan Premier William Lai told parliament on Friday that he was a ""Taiwan independence worker"" and that his position was that Taiwan was a sovereign, independent country, the widely-read Chinese tabloid the Global Times said he should be prosecuted under China's 2005 Anti-Secession Law.
""If evidence of his crimes are cast iron, then a global wanted notice can be issued for him,"" the paper, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, wrote on Saturday.
Late on Monday, China's Taiwan Affairs Office weighed in, saying Lai's comments were ""dangerous and presumptuous"", which harm peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and that Taiwan will never be separated from China.
Taiwan's China policy-making Mainland Affairs Council said the Global Times and Chinese government's comments were ""intimidating and irrational"".
""Taiwan is a democratic, pluralistic society,"" it said, adding Lai had consistently followed the president's policy of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.
China ""has repeatedly manipulated the media and so-called 'internet users' to threaten and repress Taiwan's government and people, trying to use military blows and legal threats to violate our dignity and interests"", the council said.
""This is not what a responsible party should be doing. It will only increase cross-strait antagonism and damage relations,"" it added.
""Over the past two years, our government has not 'felt animosity towards China',"" the council said. ""But mainland China must face up to the reality of the separate governments on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and respect Taiwan's democracy and will of its people.""

Chinese President Xi Jinping said last month that Taiwan would face the ""punishment of history"" for any attempt at separatism, offering his strongest warning yet to the island.

60,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2018 01:59AM ET</span>",China says it has made real efforts toward establishing Vatican relations,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China has made real efforts toward establishing relations with the Vatican, a Chinese official said on Tuesday, as expectations grow for a landmark accord between the Holy See and Beijing on the appointment of bishops.
Chinese Catholics are split between those who attend officially sanctioned churches run by government-approved bishops and technically illegal ""underground"" churches, the vast majority of which are loyal to the Vatican.
Full relations would give the Church a legal framework to look after all of China’s estimated 12 million Catholics and move on to focus on Catholic growth in a country where Protestant churches are already growing fast.
The details of a framework accord that could eventually lead to diplomatic relations between the Holy See and Beijing were worked out when a Vatican delegation visited China late last year.
""From our government's prospective we have always maintained an honest desire to improve relations and the Chinese government has always made real efforts (towards this),"" Chen Zongrong, former vice head of the State Administration for Religious Affairs, said at a news briefing. 
Tuesday's remarks follow a statement last Thursday from the Vatican that, although dialogue between the two sides continues, the deal was not about to be signed, after reports suggested it might be completed in March.
Under the expected formal deal, the Vatican will have a say in negotiations for the appointment of future bishops.
Another issue that will have to be resolved is self-ruled Taiwan, which maintains formal diplomatic ties with the Vatican. China, however, considers Taiwan a wayward province with no right to state-to-state relations.
Chen, who lost his position during a reshuffle of government departments China announced last month, added that channels of communication with the Vatican were unimpeded and Beijing hoped the Roman Catholic Church could meet it halfway.
However, religion in China must be independent of outside influence and organized within the country, he said.
Asked if denying the pope total authority to appoint bishops infringed upon the religious freedom of Chinese Catholics, Chen said, ""I don't accept that idea, and in the religious lives and practices of numerous Catholics, this does not exist."" 
Xiao Hong, a former spokeswoman of the agency, said China was actively pursuing talks with the Vatican.
News of the impending deal has split Catholic communities across China and some faith leaders and believers both in and outside China have been critical of the accord.

Cardinal Joseph Zen, 86, the outspoken former bishop of Hong Kong, said the Vatican would be ""selling out"" to China’s ruling Communist Party.

SAN JOSE (Reuters) - The resounding victory of a pro-gay marriage candidate in Costa Rica's presidential run-off vote on Sunday staved off a resurgent Christian evangelical movement that proved unable to translate strong social conservatism into a win.
Gay rights have expanded across Latin America in recent years, especially in South America, though many advocates feared there could be a backlash from practicing Christians energized by growing evangelical Protestantism.
The election campaign was dominated by opposition candidate and evangelical Fabricio Alvarado Munoz's forthright criticism of gay marriage. Weeks of polling had suggested the election was either too close to call, or leaning in his favor.
In the end, the center-left candidate of the ruling party, Carlos Alvarado Quesada, triumphed by a 20-point margin.
But voters and analysts said the result did not mean Christian conservatism was dead in Costa Rica. 
Alvarado Munoz won nearly 40 percent of the vote, but his failure owed much to his aggressive approach in what is arguably Central America's most laidback nation, they said.
""There's no question that Fabricio's extremism created fears and doubts among people,"" said Alejandro Abarca, an economics professor at the University of Costa Rica.
And his passionate opposition of gay marriage could not make up for holes in economic aspects of his platform, he added.
""Fabricio was horrible in the debates. He came across as unprepared,"" Abarca said.
A pentecostal singer and former TV anchor, Alvarado Munoz won the first round of voting in February after pledging to ignore a ruling by the San Jose-based Inter-American Court of Human Rights that Costa Rica should adopt gay marriage, even threatening to quit the court.
Doing so, he tapped into a growing trend towards conservative evangelical Christianity in Costa Rica, where 40 percent of Protestants say they were brought up as Roman Catholics, a 2014 Pew Research Center study shows.
Among people aged 18 to 34, Protestants were significantly more likely to be religious than Catholics in Latin America, including Costa Rica, the study showed.
All told, barely 30 percent of Costa Ricans favor same-sex marriage, according to a survey released in January by the CIEP think tank of the University of Costa Rica.
Fired by that religious zeal, evangelical pastors and churches have mounted strong opposition to gay marriage, seeking to characterize such liberalism as ""gender ideology.""
Alvarado Munoz's campaign used the term to attack what it saw as a movement led by gays and feminists trying to destroy the traditional family. In the end, his evangelical National Restoration Party won 14 seats in the 57-member Congress.
In the previous election it had secured just one.
Still, mixing religion with politics has its limits, said 28-year-old musician Oscar Jimenez, who felt Munoz's manifesto promise to follow ""the Christian ethic,"" with no mention of other faiths, went too far for moderate voters like him.
""This had never happened before, such polarization around this issue,"" Jimenez said.
Nevertheless, with problems such as poverty still widespread in Costa Rica, experts said the Church would continue to play a significant role in politics.
""Societies get more polarized when religious issues arise. The polarization we saw in the final stages of the campaign is bigger than in the past,"" former Costa Rican President Oscar Arias told reporters before casting his vote on Sunday.

""We need to figure out how to heal the wounds and if the social fabric has unraveled somewhat, we need to do everything possible to fix it,"" the Nobel peace laureate added.

Teodoro Campos, also a lawmaker, was beaten up in the neighborhood of Catia by pro-government thugs when he tried to stop them from stealing camera equipment from journalists, Falcon said. Images circulating on social media showed Campos, his head dripping with blood, being hauled away to a hospital.
“Presumably this was done with a brass knuckle,” Falcon said at a news conference.
He said President Nicolas Maduro’s government, faced with widespread discontent over hyperinflation and food shortages, was resorting to violence to intimidate its adversaries.
“We must put a stop to these violent circumstances in which the government, instead of solving Venezuelans’ real problems, looks to silence them by deploying its armed groups,” Falcon said, calling on Maduro to “control” his violent followers.
Reuters was not able to verify Falcon’s statement. Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Falcon is hoping to beat Maduro in a May election that the rest of the opposition is boycotting because it says the electoral process is stacked against it, with two top opposition candidates barred from office.
Many opposition members are suspicious of Falcon, once a member of the ruling socialists, and are planning to abstain from voting on May 20. 
But the 56-year-old former soldier vowed to plow on. “None of this will stop us,” Falcon said.

PARIS (Reuters) - French railway services were thrown into chaos on Tuesday, the first day of rolling nationwide strikes that are set to run for months in the toughest test yet of President Emmanuel Macron's determination to modernize the French economy.
Just one in four trains were running in the Paris region, national rail company SNCF said, as people made their way back to work after an extended Easter holiday weekend on what French media dubbed ""Black Tuesday"". 
Platforms at Gare du Nord, Paris's busiest railway station, were so crowded with commuters that some tumbled onto the tracks and had to be helped back up, television footage showed.
""I do understand why they're striking,"" said Marie Charles, a Paris commuter. ""But today is my first day in a new job so I have to admit I could have done without the strike."" 
The four main rail unions plan to strike for two days out of every five for the next three months -- a total of 36 days of disruption -- to fight a shake-up of the SNCF before its monopoly is ended in line with European Union rules.
The last French president to square off against rail unions over workers' benefits came off worst. The strikes of 1995 paralyzed France and forced Prime Minister Alain Juppe to pull the reforms -- a defeat that ultimately prompted Juppe to quit and then-president Jacques Chirac to dissolve the government.
The unions appear weaker now, however, and are divided over their responses to Macron's many social and economic reforms.
If Macron triumphs -- and this is by far the biggest test the 40-year-old former investment banker has faced so far -- it will set the tone for other proposed changes, including revamping the education system and overhauling pensions. Macron has already faced down the unions over easing labor laws.
PUBLICITY BATTLE
Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne urged labor unions to negotiate, telling BFM TV in an interview on Tuesday that ""some of them are clearly trying to turn this into a political issue"".
""The government will stand firm,"" Borne said.
In a battle for public support, union leaders, who also took to the airwaves first thing, hit back.
""The railway workers are not doing this for the fun of it,"" said Philippe Martinez, head of the hardline CGT union, the biggest among railway workers.
On the strike, he told public radio station France Inter: ""It's going to be huge. It's the government that has brought things to where they are now.""
A majority of French people view the strikes as unjustified, according to an Ifop poll published on Sunday. 
While that echoes earlier polls, such surveys also suggest voters are worried that Macron's reform plans will hit their spending power more broadly. His popularity rating is near the lowest seen since he took office in May 2017. 
As the industrial action began, nearly one in two SNCF staff stayed off work. Only one in eight high-speed TGV trains ran and international services were severely affected too.
No trains were set to run between France, Switzerland, Italy and Spain. One in every three trains to Germany was to operate, while the Eurostar service connecting London, Paris and Brussels was down to three out of every four trains, the SNCF said.
SHOWDOWN
Macron wants to transform SNCF, which adds 3 billion euros of debt a year to a pile now running at 47 billion euros, into a profit-maker. The unions say the debt was caused by excessive investment in TGV trains at the expense of everyday connections and accuse Macron of paving the way for privatization.
SNCF workers fear they could lose job-for-life guarantees, automatic annual pay rises and early retirement rights. 
The government has sought to ease tensions with assurances that the arrival of foreign competition on French rail tracks, penciled in for gradual rollout from 2020 onwards, can be delayed until as late as 2033 in some cases.
What remains unclear is whether Macron might offer further concessions to get the unions to back down before the strikes bite. It is also uncertain how long their members' resolve will last and whether the strikes will spread beyond the rail sector as the Communist-rooted CGT wants.
Energy sector workers already plan to join the strike action from April 3 to June 28, to protest against the planned liberalization of the power sector.
Air France unions have called for a strike over pay on Tuesday, although the company said it expected 75 percent of flights to operate as usual. Further Air France action is planned for April 7, 10 and 11.

The CGT has called for public and private sector workers nationwide to strike on April 19, but in a sign of union division, private sector unions have so far declined.

Asked if he believes the Jewish people have a right to a nation-state in at least part of their ancestral homeland, Mohammed bin Salman was quoted as saying: 
""I believe the Palestinians and the Israelis have the right to have their own land. But we have to have a peace agreement to assure the stability for everyone and to have normal relations.""
Saudi Arabia - birthplace of Islam and home to its holiest shrines - does not recognize Israel. It has maintained for years that normalizing relations hinges on Israeli withdrawal from Arab lands captured in the 1967 Middle East war, territory Palestinians seek for a future state.
""We have religious concerns about the fate of the holy mosque in Jerusalem and about the rights of the Palestinian people. This is what we have. We don't have any objection against any other people,"" said Prince Mohammed who is touring the United States to drum up investments and support for his efforts to contain Iranian influence.
Increased tension between Tehran and Riyadh has fueled speculation that shared interests may push Saudi Arabia and Israel to work together against what they see as a common Iranian threat.
""There are a lot of interests we share with Israel and if there is peace, there would be a lot of interest between Israel and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries"", Prince Mohammed added.
Saudi Arabia opened its airspace for the first time to a commercial flight to Israel last month, which an Israeli official hailed as historic following two years of efforts.
In November, an Israeli cabinet member disclosed covert contacts with Saudi Arabia, a rare acknowledgment of long-rumored secret dealings which Riyadh still denies. 

Saudi Arabia condemned U.S. President Donald Trump's move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel last year, but Arab officials told Reuters at the time that Riyadh appears to be on board with a broader U.S. strategy for an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan still in its early phases of development.

The grant comes a day before a visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to Ankara, where Putin and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan will also attend a ceremony to officially launch Akkuyu's first unit.
""As a result of the construction license process, an important step in the project started nearly three years ago, being completed ... it has been decided by TAEK to grant a construction license for the construction of the first unit of the Akkuyu Nuclear Plant,"" Anadolu quoted a TAEK statement.
The $20 billion, 4,800 megawatt (MW) plant, is part of Erdogan's ""2023 vision"" marking 100 years since the founding of modern Turkey and is intended to reduce Turkey's dependence on energy imports.
However, since Russia was awarded the contract in 2010, the project has been beset by delays.
Last month, sources familiar with the matter said Akkuyu was likely to miss its 2023 target start-up date, but Rosatom, which is looking for local partners to take a 49 percent stake in the project, said it is committed to the timetable.
The Interfax news agency later cited the head of Rosatom saying that the sale of the 49 percent stake was likely to be postponed from this year until 2019.
Turkish companies have been put off by the size of the financing required as well as by concerns they will not receive a sufficient share of the lucrative construction side of the deal, two industry sources have said.
Putin will make a two-day visit to Turkey from Tuesday where he will meet Erdogan and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani for a summit on Syria.

Libel is a felony in the former Soviet republic, punishable by up to seven years in prison, a policy criticized by international media rights groups as stifling press freedom.
Askar Aukenov, editor-in-chief of the Kazakh edition of Forbes magazine, said on Monday police had raided its editorial office and taken Alexander Vorotilov, the magazine's Russian deputy editor-in-chief, in for questioning.
Separately, news website Ratel.kz, known for its muckraking style, said police had raided its office and taken editor-in-chief Marat Asipov and his deputy Sapa Mekebayev to a police office for questioning.
In a brief statement, Almaty police confirmed it was investigating a libel complaint against two news websites but said it could not disclose any other information.
Vorotilov told Reuters later that none of the three journalists had been charged but police had taken his computer, phone, voice recorder and work documents.
Businessman Zeinulla Kakimzhanov told Reuters he had filed the complaint after the two outlets failed to comply with a court verdict issued in his and his family's civil case against them.
Kakimzhanov, a former government minister who has interests in wine-making among other businesses, won the lawsuit last year and the court ordered the outlets and their editors to pay him damages and withdraw all the news stories it had found libellous.
The outlets' subsequent appeal was rejected and Forbes has since paid the damages, Aukenov told Reuters.
But Kakimzhanov told Reuters on Monday that Ratel.kz had failed to withdraw the stories in question or apologize for running them, while Forbes expressed its disagreement with the court ruling as it withdrew the stories.
""What do I want?"" Kakimzhanov said. ""There is a court ruling that they must comply with.""

GAZA BORDER (Reuters) - Several thousand Palestinians remained in tent camps along the Gaza border on Monday, continuing their protest for a right of return for refugees and their descendants to what is now Israel even after 16 demonstrators were killed by Israeli troops.
The numbers were far smaller than at the peak of the demonstration over the weekend, which saw the worst violence in Gaza since the 2014 war between Israel and Hamas, the armed Islamist group that controls the sealed-off coastal enclave.
Many protesters on Monday stayed back a safe distance, wary of Israeli soldiers who remained in position on the other side of the barrier.
The Israeli military said some of those who were shot on Friday, the first day of the protest, had fired at soldiers, rolled burning tires and hurled rocks and fire bombs toward the border.
Hamas said five of the dead were members of its armed wing. Israel said eight of the 15 killed on Friday belonged to Hamas, and two to other militant factions. 
However, Hamas denied that its fighters had fired on Israeli forces, using the crowds as cover.
On Monday, the Palestinian death toll rose to 16, after Palestinian medical officials said that a 29-year-old man died of wounds he suffered on Friday. The armed wing of Islamic Jihad claimed him as a member. 
Gaza health officials said 12 people were wounded by Israeli fire on Monday and a military spokeswoman said she was checking the details.
Those who have stayed in the camps seemed to have divided into three groups. One, mostly youths, sometimes pushed to within a few dozen meters of the fence to hurl rocks at Israeli soldiers, who fired live and rubber bullets, and teargas canisters.
Others watched the stone-throwers from a distance. A third group stayed further back, sitting in and around the tents about 700 meters from the frontier. The mood there was calmer, with people snapping selfies and sharing stories about the protest while vendors sell ice cream, cigarettes and sandwiches.
HILLTOP VIEW
Gaza is home to 2 million Palestinians, the majority of them refugees. The protest, known as the ""Great March of Return"" is intended to culminate on May 15.
That is the day that Palestinians mark the 70th anniversary of the ""Nakba"" or ""Catastrophe"" when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were driven out of their homes amid violence culminating in war between the newly created State of Israel and its Arab neighbors in May 1948.
At one protest site on Monday, Medhat Basal brought seven of his grandchildren to a hilltop to look out over the border toward the town where his parents lived before 1948.
Basal, 69, said his mother gave birth to him while she was fleeing to Gaza from the family home in Beersheba, which is today an Israeli city which lies 25 miles (40 kms) from the Gaza border. 
""If I don't make it to Beersheba, one of my grandchildren may do,"" Basal said.
Israel has long ruled out any right of return for the refugees, fearing that it would lose its Jewish majority.
Last week's deaths prompted U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the European Union’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, to call for an independent investigation. In his Easter address, Pope Francis also referred to ""the wounds of ongoing conflict that do not spare the defenseless"".
But Israel's government has rejected the criticism, saying it had to prevent infiltration from Gaza. A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas, the armed Islamist group which controls Gaza, of sending ""children to war zones"". 
Hamas rejected Israeli accusations as ""lies aimed to justify Friday's massacre"".

Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli defense minister, said its soldiers did what was necessary to protect Israel's border.

Since that call, on March 20, preparations for a possible summit have not progressed because of a diplomatic row, the aide, Yuri Ushakov, said.
""When our presidents spoke on the phone, Trump proposed having the first meeting in Washington, in the White House,"" Ushakov told reporters at a briefing.
""Trump called Putin last month to congratulate him on his election victory and told reporters he believed he and Putin would meet ""in the not too distant future.""
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders did not confirm an invitation had been issued to Putin, but said the two had discussed a number of venues for a potential meeting, including the White House.
""We have nothing further to add at this time,"" she told reporters on Monday.
Rolling out a welcome for Putin in the White House, rather than at a neutral location, could anger Trump's domestic critics, who accuse Russia of hostile acts against Western countries, including the United States.
Some current and former members of Trump's team are under investigation for alleged collusion with Russia in the run-up to Trump's inauguration. Trump denies any collusion. 
Since the March 20 phone call, Washington expelled 60 Russian diplomats and closed a Russian consulate over allegations that Russia was behind the poisoning of former Russian spy and his daughter in Britain. 
Russia denies involvement and has retaliated against the diplomatic sanctions in kind.
""Against the backdrop of these events, it's difficult to discuss the possibility of holding a summit"", Ushakov said. 
""We want to believe that the discussions (on a proposed summit) will begin,"" Ushakov said. 

""We want to hope that... one day, at one time or another we can arrive at the start of a serious and constructive dialogue.""

73,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 11:04AM ET</span>","Winnie Mandela, 'mother' then 'mugger' of new South Africa, dies at 81","By Ed Cropley
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Hailed as mother of the 'new' South Africa, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's legacy as an anti-apartheid heroine was undone when she was revealed to be a ruthless ideologue prepared to sacrifice laws and lives in pursuit of revolution and redress.
Her uncompromising methods and refusal to forgive contrasted sharply with the reconciliation espoused by her husband Nelson Mandela as he worked to forge a stable, pluralistic democracy from the racial division and oppression of apartheid.
The contradiction helped kill their marriage and destroyed the esteem in which she was held by many South Africans, although the firebrand activist retained the support of radical black nationalists to the end.
In her twilight years, Madikizela-Mandela, who died on Monday aged 81, had frequent run-ins with authority that further undermined her reputation as a fighter against the white-minority regime that ran Africa's most advanced economy from 1948 to 1994.
During her husband's 27-year incarceration, Madikizela-Mandela campaigned tirelessly for his release and for the rights of black South Africans, suffering years of detention, banishment and arrest by the white authorities.
She remained steadfast and unbowed throughout, emerging to punch the air triumphantly in the clenched-fist salute of black power as she walked hand-in-hand with Mandela out of Cape Town's Victor Vester prison on Feb. 11, 1990.
For husband and wife, it was a crowning moment that led four years later to the end of centuries of white domination when Mandela became South Africa's first black president.
""HORRIBLY WRONG""
But for Madikizela-Mandela, the end of apartheid marked the start of a string of legal and political troubles that, accompanied by tales of her glamorous living, kept her in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.
As evidence emerged in the dying years of apartheid of the brutality of her Soweto enforcers, the ""Mandela United Football Club"" (MUFC), her soubriquet switched from 'Mother of the Nation' to 'Mugger'.
Blamed for the killing of activist Stompie Seipei, who was found near her Soweto home with his throat cut, she was convicted in 1991 of kidnapping and assaulting the 14-year-old because he was suspected of being an informer.
Her six-year jail term was reduced on appeal to a fine.
She and Mandela separated in 1992 and her reputation slipped further when he sacked her from his cabinet in 1995 after allegations of corruption. The couple divorced a year later, after which she adopted the surname Madikizela-Mandela.
Appearing at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) set up to unearth atrocities committed by both sides in the anti-apartheid struggle, Madikizela-Mandela refused to show remorse for abductions and murders carried out in her name.
Only after pleading from anguished TRC chairman Archbishop Desmond Tutu did she admit grudgingly that ""things went horribly wrong"".
In its final report, the TRC ruled that Madikizela-Mandela was ""politically and morally accountable for the gross violations of human rights committed by the MUFC"".
Four years later, she was back in court, facing fraud and theft charges in relation to an elaborate bank loan scheme.
""Somewhere it seems that something went wrong,"" magistrate Peet Johnson said as he sentenced her to five years in jail, later overturned on appeal. ""You should set the example for all of us.""
MARRIED TO THE STRUGGLE
Born on Sept. 26, 1936, in Bizana, Eastern Cape province, Madikizela-Mandela became politicized at an early age in her job as a hospital social worker.
""I started to realize the abject poverty under which most people were forced to live, the appalling conditions created by the inequalities of the system,"" she once said.
Strikingly attractive and with a steely air - her given name, Nomzamo, means 'one who strives' - the 22-year-old Winnie caught the eye of Mandela at a Soweto bus-stop in 1957, starting a whirlwind romance that led to their marriage a year later.
But with husband and wife pouring their energies into the fight against apartheid, the relationship struggled before being torn apart after six years when Mandela was arrested and sentenced to life in prison.
Madikizela-Mandela later described her marriage as a sham and the birth of their two daughters, Zindzi and Zenani, as ""quite coincidental"" to her one true love - the struggle against white rule.
""I was married to the ANC. It was the best marriage I ever had,"" she often said.
Graca Machel, who stepped into her shoes as South Africa's first lady when she married Mandela in 1998, paid tribute to her predecessor in the years after her union.

""I'M NOT SORRY"" 
As the years passed and Madikizela-Mandela's public standing plummeted, her relationship with the party she loved soured. She bore the air of a troublemaker, arriving late at rallies and haranguing comrades, including Thabo Mbeki, Mandela's successor as president.
In 2001, a television camera caught Mbeki brushing Madikizela-Mandela away and knocking off her hat after she arrived an hour late for a rally to commemorate a 1976 anti-apartheid uprising by Soweto schoolchildren and students.
Years later, she clashed with the next president, Jacob Zuma, becoming a political patron of renegade ANC youth leader Julius Malema, who quit the century-old movement to found his own ultra-leftist political party.
Confirming her support for Malema and his calls for seizure of white-owned farms and banks, Madikizela-Mandela revealed her contempt in 2010 for the deal her ex-husband struck with South Africa's white minority nearly two decades before.
In a London newspaper interview, she attacked Mandela, who died in December 2013, saying he had gone soft in prison and sold out the black cause.
""Mandela did go to prison and he went in there as a burning young revolutionary. But look what came out,"" she said. ""Mandela let us down. He agreed to a bad deal for the blacks.""
She also dismissed Tutu, post-apartheid South Africa's moral fulcrum, as a ""cretin"" and rubbished his attempts at national healing as a ""religious circus"".
""I told him a few home truths. I told him that he and his other like-minded cretins were only sitting here because of our struggle and me - because of the things I and people like me had done to get freedom,"" she said. 

""I am not sorry. I will never be sorry,"" she concluded. ""I would do everything I did again if I had to. Everything.""

The border guards were detained after crossing the frontier in a heavily forested area in north-eastern Greece in bad weather on March 1.
""It appears that Turkey - and this was one of our concerns from the outset - wants to use this for political purposes,"" said Greek government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos.
The rhetoric between the two countries has soured in recent years, and since eight soldiers fled to Greece in the wake of an aborted coup in Turkey in July 2016, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly accused Greece of harboring 'coupists'.
He has also accused Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of reneging on a promise to swiftly send the eight back.
Greece has said its two soldiers crossed into Turkey by mistake while on foot patrol in bad weather. Turkish courts have ordered their detention on suspicion of illegal entry and attempted military espionage.
""A month later and we don't even have charges by the Turkish judiciary against the two Greek soldiers, something which I think is crossing the line,"" Tzanakopoulos told Real FM, an Athens radio station.
Greece and Turkey have a host of historical grievances, from ethnically divided Cyprus to mineral and airspace rights in the Aegean Sea. 
While there has been no clear suggestion that the cases involving the two sides' soldiers are connected, there has been plenty of speculation. Tzanakopoulos said, however, that the two matters were ""totally unsimilar"".
Greek courts have now rejected three times Turkey's demands that the eight Turkish soldiers be extradited.
""The rule of law prevails in Greece, which has a Prime Minister who respects and is familiar with Greek judicial practice, and not a Sultan who can make promises on their (judicial) rulings,"" a statement from Tsipras's office said on Sunday.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has been re-elected with 97 percent of votes, the same proportion that the former military commander secured four years ago for his first term but with a lower turnout, official results showed on Monday.
Turnout was 41 percent, despite efforts to get as many Egyptians as possible to polling stations during last week's vote. Sisi had been virtually guaranteed a landslide win, confirmed by early tallies as voting ended on Wednesday.
The election featured only one other candidate - himself an ardent Sisi supporter - after all serious opposition contenders halted their campaigns in January. The main challenger was arrested and his campaign manager beaten up, while other presidential hopefuls pulled out, citing intimidation.
Sisi said he had wanted more candidates to run and that he had nothing to do with the opposition withdrawals.
The election commission said the vote was free and fair as it gave the results in a televised announcement on Monday.
Sisi won a total of 21.8 million votes compared with 656,534 for his opponent, Moussa Mostafa Moussa, whose tally was less than the 1.8 million spoiled ballots.
The lower turnout is a potential setback for Sisi, who suggested before the vote that he saw it as a referendum on his presidency rather than a genuine contest. Turnout in the 2014 vote that won him his first term was 47 percent.
State media had portrayed failure to vote as a betrayal of Egypt. Some voters said they were offered incentives to cast their ballots including money and food, local and international media reported, but did not say who had made the offers. 
Officials said that if any such incidents took place they were not state-sponsored and extremely limited.
CRITICISM
Critics say former general Sisi's popularity has been eroded amid tough economic reforms, which have left most Egyptians worse off, and also an unprecedented crackdown on dissent.
His supporters say those measures are needed to stabilize the country, which faces a stubborn Islamic State insurgency in the northern Sinai Peninsula and which was rocked by unrest after a 2011 uprising that ousted veteran leader Hosni Mubarak.
Sisi led the 2013 military overthrow of Egypt's first freely-elected president, Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood, after protests against Mursi. Sisi swept to victory in an election a year later with 97 percent of the vote.
The United Nations expressed concern over the crackdown on dissent, including media, which took place before last week's vote.
Sisi's main Western and regional allies have been mostly silent over alleged human rights abuses in Egypt.
During voting last week, the U.S. embassy in Cairo said on Twitter it was ""impressed by the enthusiasm and patriotism of Egyptian voters"".

Russia congratulated Sisi on his election win ahead of the official results, and regional ally King Salman of Saudi Arabia called Sisi on Monday to express support, saying his victory came as a result of strong efforts to combat terrorism.

Prime Minister Najib Razak's government secured a simple majority in parliament to pass the Anti-Fake News 2018 bill, which sets out fines of up to 500,000 ringgit ($123,000) and a maximum six years in jail. The first draft of the bill had proposed jail of up to 10 years.
The government said the law would not impinge on freedom of speech and cases under it would be handled through an independent court process.
""This law aims to protect the public from the spread of fake news, while allowing freedom of speech as provided for under the constitution,"" Law Minister Azalina Othman Said told parliament.
The law defines fake news as “news, information, data and reports which is or are wholly or partly false” and includes features, visuals and audio recordings.
It covers digital publications and social media and will apply to offenders who maliciously spread ""fake news"" inside and outside Malaysia, including foreigners, if Malaysia or a Malaysian citizen were affected.
Co-opted by U.S. President Donald Trump, the term ""fake news"" has quickly become part of the standard repertoire of leaders in authoritarian countries to describe media reports and organizations critical of them.
The U.N. Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, David Kaye, had earlier on Monday urged the government not to rush the legislation through parliament.
""I urge the government to reconsider the bill and open it up to regular and genuine public scrutiny before taking any further steps,"" David Kaye said in a Twitter post.
OTHERS CONSIDER LAWS
Other countries in Southeast Asia, including Singapore and the Philippines, are considering how to tackle ""fake news"" but human rights activists fear that laws against it could be used to stifle free speech.
Malaysia is among the first few countries to introduce a law against it. Germany approved a plan last year to fine social media networks if they fail to remove hateful postings.
Malaysia already has an arsenal of laws, including a colonial-era Sedition Act, that have been used to clamp down on unfavorable news and social media posts.
News reports and social media posts on a multi-billion dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) have hounded Prime Minister Najib, who faces arguably his toughest contest in a general election this year that could be called in days.
Najib has denied any wrongdoing in connection with losses at the fund.
A deputy minister was quoted in media last month as saying any news on 1MDB not verified by the government was ""fake"".

Lim Kit Siang, a senior opposition lawmaker with the Democratic Action Party, described the bill as a ""Save Najib from 1MDB Scandal Bill"" which would criminalize news on the affair.

79,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 11:23AM ET</span>","Israel says to send 16,000 African migrants to Western countries","By Maayan Lubell
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel said on Monday it has scrapped a plan to deport African migrants to Africa and reached an agreement with the U.N. refugee agency to send more than 16,000 to Western countries instead.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named Canada, Italy and Germany as some of the nations that will take in the migrants. 
Other migrants, many of whom are seeking asylum, will be allowed to remain in Israel, which they entered illegally on foot through the border with Egypt, for at least the next five years.
The fate of some 37,000 Africans in Israel has posed a moral dilemma for a state founded as a haven for Jews from persecution and a national home. The right-wing government has been under pressure from its nationalist voter base to expel the migrants.
But the planned mass deportation led to legal challenges in Israel, drew criticism from the United Nations and rights groups and triggered an emotional public debate among Israelis.
In February, Israeli authorities started handing out notices to 20,000 male African migrants giving them two months to leave for a third country in Africa or risk being put in jail indefinitely.
Teklit Michael, who came to Israel from Eritrea a decade ago, said he was delighted by the new deal.
""I saw in the past few years a lot of people lose their hopes because of that deportation to an unsafe place,"" said Michael, 29.
MONEY AND AN AIR TICKET
The Israeli government has offered migrants, most of them from Sudan and Eritrea, $3,500 and a plane ticket to what it says is a safe destination. At immigration hearings, migrants were told they could choose to go to Rwanda or Uganda.
But rights groups advocating on their behalf say that many fled abuse and war and that their expulsion, even to a different country in Africa, would endanger them further.
The groups had challenged the deportation plan in Israel's High Court, which on March 15 issued a temporary order that froze its implementation.
Netanyahu said the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees had agreed to organize and fund the new plan that would take five years to implement.
""The joint commitment is that 'You take out 16,250 and we will leave 16,250 as temporary residents'. That enables the departure of a very large number of people, 6,000 in the first 18 months,"" Netanyahu said at a news conference in Jerusalem.
A UNHCR spokeswoman in Tel Aviv confirmed that an agreement had been reached but gave no details.
The U.N.'s refugee agency had urged Israel to reconsider its original plan, saying migrants who have relocated to sub-Saharan Africa in the past few years were unsafe and ended up on the perilous migrant trail to Europe, some suffering abuse, torture and even dying on the way.

The largest community of African migrants, about 15,000, lives in south Tel Aviv, in a poor neighborhood where shops are dotted with signs in Tigrinya and other African languages and abandoned warehouses have been converted into churches for the largely Christian Eritreans.

80,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",UNHCR concerned over safety of 56 Rohingya refugees in stormy seas,"DHAKA (Reuters) - The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said on Monday it was concerned about the safety of 56 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar on a boat bound for Malaysia in stormy seas.
Some 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled from their homes in Myanmar's Rakhine State into Bangladesh after militant attacks in August sparked a military crackdown that the United Nations and Western countries have said constitutes ethnic cleansing.
Myanmar rejects that saying its forces have been waging a legitimate campaign against ""terrorists"" who attacked government forces.
The boat, which a UNHCR spokesman said was believed to have set sail from Rakhine State last week, stopped at an island in southern Thailand on Saturday evening after a storm. 
It was the first Rohingya vessel, plying a route refugees have used for years to get to Southeast Asia, to be spotted off Thailand in more than a year. There are signs that overcrowding in Bangladeshi camps could prompt many others to make similarly perilous voyages. 
""Given the poor weather conditions currently prevailing in the waters off the west coast of the Thailand-Malaysia border, we are concerned for the safety of the refugees,” said Caroline Gluck, a UNHCR spokeswoman based in southeast Bangladesh.
""If they are found to be in distress, we hope they will be rescued and allowed to disembark in accordance with international maritime law,” she said in an email.
The boat was restocked with essential supplies in Thailand on Sunday before setting back out to sea, on its way to Malaysia, Thai police said.
The UNHCR said it was in touch with Malaysian maritime authorities and was ready to provide any necessary assistance to the refugees when they arrived.
Tens of thousands of Rohingya fled by sea following an outbreak of sectarian violence in Rakhine State in 2012, some falling prey to human traffickers. 
That exodus peaked in 2015, when an estimated 25,000 people fled across the Andaman Sea for Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.
Rights groups expect another surge in Rohingya boats sailing for Southeast Asia, even if not at the levels of the past.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A ministerial committee set up to examine the future of a house that is at the center of a family feud between Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his two siblings said on Monday it had decided a future government of the island state should make the final call.
In a 21-page report it said there were three options for the former home of modern Singapore's founding leader, Lee Kuan Yew, whose children are battling over the property. Lee Kuan Yew died in 2015.
The government could keep the entire property as a national monument for conservation, it could retain only the room with most historical significance (the dining room) and demolish the rest, or it could knock down the property and redevelop the site.
By releasing the report, the committee said it hoped at least one aspect of the matter had been settled. ""With this, we hope to close the chapter on this topic, and focus on other pressing national issues ahead of us,"" said Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, who chaired the panel.
Lee Hsien Loong may not be running the government that makes the final decision. He said in October he intends to step down and hand over to a successor in a couple of years time.
His younger brother, Lee Hsien Yang, who owns the property, and sister Lee Wei Ling, who still lives there, had wanted the house to be eventually demolished in accordance with what they say were their father's wishes as stated in his will. 
Last summer they accused their brother, the prime minister, of seeking to turn the home into a shrine to a political dynasty. They also said they feared their brother was going to use the organs of the state against them.
The prime minister last year denied there was any abuse of power and questioned whether his father really wanted the home, which is near Singapore's bustling Orchard Road shopping district, to be knocked down.
The committee said in its view ""that while Mr Lee Kuan Yew's preference was for the Property to be demolished, he was prepared to accept options other than demolition,"" adding that their conclusions were made on the grounds that the house had an ""architectural, heritage and historical significance"".
The public conflict that gripped Singapore for at least a month last year prompted a two-day long parliamentary debate which found no evidence of abuse of power. Prime Minister Lee's siblings called the debate a ""whitewash"" at the time.
In a statement on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) after the report was issued, the prime minister noted he had recused himself from the discussions and said that the committee was correct to point out that there was no need for a decision now as his sister was still living in the house. 
""I hope that when the time comes to decide on what to do with the house, this report will help the Government of the day to make an informed decision that both respects my father’s wishes and is in the public interest,"" he said.

Andrei Karlov was shot dead by an off-duty policeman while speaking at an Ankara exhibit opening in December 2016. The gunman shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" and ""Don't forget Aleppo!"" as he opened fire, apparently referring to Russia's involvement in neighboring Syria. He was shot dead by police at the scene.
Putin arrives on a two-day visit on Tuesday and will meet President Tayyip Erdogan and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Their three countries are the guarantors of the Astana peace talks that has set up ""de-escalation"" zones across war-torn Syria.
Erdogan said Gulen's movement was behind the assassination, a charge the cleric has denied. Erdogan also blames the preacher's network for an attempted military coup in July 2016.
Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, has denied the charge and condemned the coup. 
Haberturk said the authorities ordered the arrests of the eight as the killing was carried out on their orders. 
Authorities have so far arrested seven others, including three policeman, in relation to the killing, the Hurriyet newspaper reported.
No one was immediately available for comment at the Ankara prosecutor's office.
The gunman came from Soke in southwest Turkey, considered one of the country's most secular regions. His father said his son's behavior started changing after he joined the police academy, where he became more pious, according to media reports at the time.

While the slogans he shouted suggest he was sympathetic to radical Islamist ideology, Gulen's network preaches interfaith dialogue. The Turkish government says such teachings are designed to mask the true nature of what they call a dangerous, secretive organization.

Medics and a witness who saw the wreckage said the air strike had destroyed a house in al-Hali district, where displaced civilians from other provinces were settled. 
The 12 victims were all from the same family, they said.
A spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition told Reuters: ""We take this report very seriously and it will be fully investigated as all reports of this nature are - using an internationally approved, independent process. Whilst this is ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment further.""
Hodeidah is home to the impoverished country's biggest port from where most of the humanitarian aid reaches millions of civilians on the brink of famine. The operation of port, controlled by the Iran-aligned Houthis, was not affected by the air strike.
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened in a civil war in Yemen in 2015 against the Houthis to restore the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
The alliance, which includes other Sunni Muslim states, has conducted thousands of air strikes targeting Houthi fighters and has often hit civilian areas, although it denies ever doing so intentionally. 
The war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than 2 million and driven the country - already the poorest on the Arabian Peninsula - to the verge of famine.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Protesters led by India's lower-caste Dalit community on Monday set fire to police posts and blocked railway tracks as they opposed a Supreme Court ruling that bars immediate arrest of individuals accused of discriminating against them, media said.
Dalits are at the bottom of India's ancient caste hierarchy and form about a quarter of the population. Some protesters carried banners demanding a nationwide shutdown, while others held placards saying the judgment was diluting the law.
""Get out in strong numbers, block the roads if needed, but do not touch public property,"" Jignesh Mevani, an independent Dalit lawmaker from the western state of Gujarat, told the India Today news channel.
Although he backed the protests, Mevani said, he was opposed to any damage to public property.
Television showed images of police beating protesters and an unidentified person firing shots, with demonstrators in the northern state of Haryana also setting police posts ablaze and attacking shops.
Four people were killed in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, where police imposed a curfew and blocked internet services in some places, television showed.
Shops were shut as protesters blocked key roads in many areas, including the capital, New Delhi, and the industrial city of Ahmedabad in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat, the paper added. 
Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that arrests under a law meant to speed action on complaints of violence against Dalits required prior sanction from officials, and barred the immediate arrest of those accused in such complaints.
In its judgment the court said prior approval was required following the acknowledged abuse of provisions for arrest in such cases.
By the end of 2016, about 90 percent of roughly 145,000 cases involving Dalits were still awaiting trial, government data from last year showed.
Investigation showed that fewer than a tenth of the cases brought by Dalits in 2016 were proved false, according to government data. 
Modi's government on Monday submitted a review petition to the court, asking it to amend the judgment, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said in a televised interview. 

Hindus, who account for more than 85 percent of India's population of 1.3 billion, were traditionally grouped into thousands of castes, whose membership was determined by birth.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - The last Syrian rebel group in eastern Ghouta near Damascus began withdrawing on Monday under an agreement with the government, state media said, though a military source said a group of insurgents were still rejecting the deal.
Jaish al-Islam, which has been defending the eastern Ghouta town of Douma against a ferocious onslaught by Russian-backed Syrian government forces, has not confirmed the agreement with the government.
If confirmed, the departure of Jaish al-Islam from Douma would mark the end of the war for eastern Ghouta, wiping out an opposition stronghold near Damascus and underlining President Bashar al-Assad's unassailable position in the war.
It will mark his biggest victory over rebels fighting to unseat him since the recovery of eastern Aleppo in 2016.
Indicating divisions in Jaish al-Islam, a Syrian military source told Reuters some of the fighters were rejecting the deal and the army would use force unless they accepted it.
""They will all have to agree to the settlement in the end,"" the source said. 
Syrian state TV said eight buses carrying 448 people - fighters and their families - had left Douma so far on Monday, en route for the north. State media has said the rebels are due to go to areas near the Turkish-Syrian border that are controlled by opposition groups.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war, said dozens of buses had entered Douma early on Monday in readiness to evacuate the rebels and their families to the northern towns of Jarablus and al-Bab, near the Turkish border.
The towns are located in a section of the Turkish-Syrian frontier where Turkey has carved out a buffer zone controlled on the ground by its military and allied fighters from Free Syrian Army rebel groups that are hostile to Assad.
RETAKING CONTROL
Under the deal, Syrian state media said Jaish al-Islam would hand over heavy and medium-sized weapons and acknowledge the restoration of the Damascus government's control of Douma. 
The government lost control of Douma, the largest urban center in the eastern suburbs of Damascus, in the early phase of Syria's civil war, now in its eighth year.
Thousands of rebels, their families and other civilians have already departed other parts of eastern Ghouta for Idlib province, another insurgent-held area of northern Syria.
Tens of thousands more people have fled to shelters in government-held territory near Ghouta.
The government offensive on Ghouta has been one of the deadliest of the war, killing more than 1,600 civilians, according to the Observatory. The government says it is restoring security to Damascus, which was regularly shelled from eastern Ghouta during the war.
Assad, who has military support from Iran and Russia, now controls the bulk of Syria, though it may be difficult for him to recover much more territory without risking a collision with other foreign powers that have forces inside the country.
The second largest chunk of Syrian territory is controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces, an alliance of militias spearheaded by the Syrian Kurdish YPG and supported by the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State.
U.S. President Donald Trump added fresh uncertainty to the outlook for the conflict last week by indicating that the United States would soon be leaving Syria.
Trump has told advisers he wants an early exit of U.S. troops from Syria, two senior administration officials said on Friday, a stance that may put him at odds with U.S. military officials who see the fight against Islamic State as nowhere near complete.
Turkey, alarmed by the growth of Kurdish influence in Syria, has recently expanded its foothold in the north of the country by seizing the northwestern Afrin region from the YPG, supported by Turkey-backed Syrian militias.

Rebels also still control a significant chunk of territory on the frontiers with Jordan and Israel, which are both anxious about the growth of Iranian influence in Syria.

The lawsuit, filed on behalf of 3,000 people, is the first class-action lawsuit filed in a Thai court by plaintiffs from another country against a Thai company operating outside Thailand, the group, Inclusive Development International, said in a statement.
The plaintiffs accuse sugar producer Mitr Phol [MIDSMP.UL] of violently displacing them in Cambodia's northwestern Oddar Meanchey province between 2008 and 2009 to make way for plantations.
""Since Mitr Phol took my land, my family and I have suffered tremendously,"" Ma Okchoeurn, one of the affected people, said in a press release issued by the rights group.
""My house was burned down. I was arrested without reason, and as a result my family had nothing to eat and had to collect trash to survive. To this day, I have no land or house.""
Mitr Phol said in a statement emailed to Reuters it had invested in Cambodia in ""a good faith partnership"" with the government and got temporary concessions in compliance with all local and national laws and with assurances from authorities that ""all temporary concession areas had been processed legally and transparently"".
It said it had withdrawn from the project in 2014 due to a combination of factors including political tensions along the Thai-Cambodia border, business risks, adverse agricultural conditions and negative publicity.
Mitr Phol said after it withdrew from the project, it had recommended that the Cambodian government return land ""to the affected communities"".
Seng Loth, a spokesman at Land Management Ministry, which was responsible for the government's involvement in the project, said when contacted by Reuters he was in a meeting and too busy to comment.
Government spokesman Phay Siphan said he could not comment and referred queries to the Land Management Ministry.
Cambodia has awarded big concessions to foreign companies, mainly from China, Vietnam and South Korea, to operate mines, power plants and farms, in order to attract foreign investment.
Rights groups have said some concessions have led to forced evictions and land disputes.

A family friend said earlier Malala planned to return home after completing her education at Oxford University, where she is reading for a degree in politics, philosophy and economics. 
Malala wrote an anonymous blog for the BBC Urdu service as a schoolgirl during the Taliban rule and later became outspoken in advocating more educational opportunities for girls.

In 2014, Malala became the youngest Nobel laureate, honored for her work with the Malala Foundation, a charity she set up to support education advocacy groups with a focus on Pakistan, Nigeria, Jordan, Syria and Kenya.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia's parliament swore in Abiye Ahmed as prime minister on Monday with a mandate to implement democratic reforms aimed partly at defusing ethnic tensions in the Oromiya province from which the former army lieutenant general hails.
The ruling coalition picked Abiye last week to replace Hailemariam Desalegn who quit to clear the way for reforms. 
Oromiya, which surrounds the capital Addis Ababa, has been rocked by violence since 2015. This is fueled largely by a sense among young members of the Oromo ethnic group, which makes up roughly a third of Ethiopia's 100 million population, that they are politically and economically marginalized. 
Abiye, 42, took the oath of office in a ceremony at the House of People's Representatives in Addis Ababa.
""Today is a historic day. We bear witness to a peaceful transfer of power. Today our situation presents us with opportunities and threats. Today we are in the midst of uncertain times,"" Abiye said in a speech to parliament.
The ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) has been in power since 1991, when it took over from the Derg military regime. But the protests and unrest in Oromiya have posed the biggest ever threat to its continued rule.
Abiye's Oromo heritage appears to be a calculated attempt to soothe tensions in his home region. 
Human rights groups say that security forces have killed hundreds of people in violence. 
Tens of thousands were also jailed. But in the run-up to Haliemariam's resignation last month, more than 6,000 prisoners had been freed as the government struggled to calm discontent. It is unclear how many remain in jail.

Ethiopia, which is Africa's second most populous nation and also has had the continent's fastest growing economy over the past decade, has been under a state of emergency since Feb. 16, the day after Hailemariam resigned.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Floods caused by a tropical cyclone that brought torrential weekend rains to the Pacific island nation of Fiji have killed four people, with another presumed drowned, a disaster management official said on Monday.
Tropical Cyclone Josie, a category-one storm, caused severe flooding, with the northwestern town of Ba on Fiji's largest island, Viti Levu, said to be the worst hit.
Four bodies had been retrieved and authorities do not expect that the missing person survived, said Anare Leweniqila, the director of the Fiji National Disaster Management Office.
""The death toll will go to five when we find their body,"" he told Reuters by telephone.
He said 1,873 people sheltering in 35 evacuation centers would not be able to return home until mosquito spraying was completed.
""In two to three days people can go home after the clean-up and the vector spraying for diseases in the worst affected areas,"" Leweniqila added. 
The Fiji Meteorological Service warned of heavy rain expected on Monday afternoon in Fiji and surrounding islands, as Tropical Cyclone Josie moved away in a south-southeast direction.
Leweniqila said the authorities did not envisage any more flooding as the water level was receding even after heavy rain, but that road damage had been extensive.
Up to 74 roads were closed due to flooding.

In February, Fiji escaped without deaths or widespread damage when Gita, a category 4 tropical cyclone, lashed the country with winds of up to 275 km per hour (171 mph).

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - A Boko Haram attack in the Nigerian city of Maiduguri killed at least 15 people and wounded 83, a military spokesman said on Monday, in the biggest strike since the government said it was in talks with the Islamist militant group.
The military said the incident occurred late on Sunday and included gun battles between government troops and the militants as they tried to enter Maiduguri, a city in northeast Nigeria which is the epicentre of a nine-year conflict with Boko Harm that has caused the deaths of more than 20,000 people.
President Muhammadu Buhari has prioritized improving security and has previously declared the defeat of Boko Haram, which is trying to establish an Islamic state and which split into two factions in 2016. 
The military said troops clashed with the jihadists in a cashew plantation around Bille Shuwa and Alikaranti villages, near Giwa barracks on the edge of Maiduguri's inner city, at around 08:10 p.m. (1910 GMT) on Sunday and fought gun battles with government troops during which multiple blasts were heard. 
""Fifteen persons including a soldier have so far been confirmed dead in the encounter, while about 83 persons who suffered varying degrees of injuries are receiving due medical attention,"" said army spokesman Colonel Onyema Nwachukwu.
He said 13 insurgents had been killed, including seven bombers, adding that the retreating militants attacked locals. 
""It is clear that the remnants of the Boko Haram terrorists are hell-bent on remaining relevant by attacking soft and vulnerable targets,"" Nwachukwu added.
TALKS
It is the most significant attack on the city since the government said last week it was in talks with the insurgents with the aim of securing a permanent ceasefire.
The government has not disclosed which elements of Boko Haram it is in discussions with and it was also not clear which faction carried out Sunday's attack.
The government has been saying since December 2015 that the jihadist group has been defeated but high-profile attacks in the last few months - including the kidnap of 111 schoolgirls from the town of Dapchi and a strike in the town of Rann that killed three aid workers - has shown the jihadists remain active.
All but one of the girls taken from Dapchi, in Yobe state, on Feb. 19 were returned by the militants in March. The government later said it had negotiated their release as part of broader talks.
In early 2015 Boko Haram controlled a swathe of land in northeast Nigeria around the size of Belgium but was forced out of most of that territory by the army with the support of troops from neighbouring countries. 

Since then the group has continued to carry out suicide bombings, gun raids and kidnappings in northeastern Nigeria as well as in neighbouring Cameroon, Niger and Chad.

Ferdinand Marcos Jr, a former senator popularly known as Bongbong, is furious about having lost to Leni Robredo by about 260,000 votes in a May 2016 election he says was marred by massive cheating.
Many political commentators believe Marcos has ambitions to become president one day, and wanted to use the vice presidency as a stepping stone. Opinion polls had shown him the clear leader ahead of the vote, which is separate from that for the presidency.
The recount, ordered by the Supreme Court, began with Marcos questioning the condition of some ballots from the town of Bato in Robredo's home province of Camarines Sur.
""In four precincts in the town of Bato, all ballots are wet and thus useless,"" he told reporters. Alluding to foul play, he added that the ballots seemed to be ""only recently wet"".
Audit logs for most of the precincts were missing, he said, and he had seen a ballot box with a hole sealed with a masking tape.
""We have nothing to fear because the truth is what we are fighting for,"" Robredo, a one-term congresswoman before the 2016 election, said in a speech after a mass service organized by her supporters in the largely Roman Catholic country.
Robredo, who hails from a decades-old political clique that opposes Duterte and helped oust Marcos in 1986, had lodged a counter protest, questioning results in about 8,000 voting precincts.
Although he was not his running mate, Marcos is on good terms with President Rodrigo Duterte, who has made numerous concessions to the Marcos family.
He has constantly praised the leadership of the late dictator, fuelling concern among some Filipinos that he might cling on to power.

Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in 1972 and held power for 14 years until his removal in a bloodless, military-backed ""People Power"" uprising.

SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Costa Rica's President-elect Carlos Alvarado Quesada ran up a bigger-than-expected margin of victory in Sunday's runoff election, leading a progressive coalition to beat back a stiff run from a Christian conservative singer.
The 38-year-old former minister in the outgoing government is now set to join French President Emmanuel Macron and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern as democratically elected heads of state before turning 40.
Like them, Alvarado Munoz ran unabashedly on a center-left platform.
He has faced much stronger headwinds by backing gay marriage in the conservative Central American country. In the closing days of the campaign, a poll showed seven in 10 Costa Ricans were opposed to such unions.
His decisive 20-point margin of victory offers hope to fellow progressives elsewhere in Latin America working to defeat an evangelical-led backlash that has grown alongside expanding acceptance of gay and lesbian rights.
It also gives hope to his supporters that he can unite the country that decades ago gave up a standing army and is known worldwide for its ecological stewardship.
Alvarado Quesada, who earned his masters in Britain and worked for three years for Procter & Gamble in Panama, told Reuters in a recent interview he saw a larger trend in the divide exposed after a January court ruling called on Costa Rica to legalize same-sex marriage.
""I think it's a reflection of what's happening in the region and the world,"" he said. ""People are experimenting across the world with movements that push single-issue or populist agendas.""
Alvarado Quesada said he decided to step up after seeing what happened in the United Kingdom with the Brexit vote, what happened in Colombia after the referendum on peace, and seeing Western democracies face populist or fundamentalist movements.
Before deciding to run for president, Alvarado Quesada served as social development minister and then labor minister under Luis Guillermo Solis, whose center-left party he worked in his 20s.
As a younger man, he also sang in a college rock band called Dramatika.
Following college, his first job was at a sports gambling call center, where he took bets on mostly U.S. teams in order to make enough money to buy his first guitar. 
Costa Rica's future president later turned to fiction writing, publishing four books over the course of a decade, including his novel ""The life of Cornelius Brown.""
The married father of one will now face the difficult task of forging consensus in a country where large swaths of people have been polarized by faith-based appeals, a development many voters described as unprecedented.
But his supporters point to his reserved nature as a strength, arguing his instinct toward negotiation will serve the country well after a hard-fought campaign. 

Alvarado Quesada will take office on May 8.

96,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Mexican leftist has 18-point lead as campaign kicks off - poll,"By Christine Murray
MONTERREY (Reuters) - Mexican left-wing presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has an 18-point lead ahead of the July 1 election, according to a poll published on Monday that showed him with a growing advantage at the start of formal campaigning.
Lopez Obrador, who launched his campaign on Sunday, holds 38 percent of the vote, according to the poll by Parametria, published by Reuters on Monday ahead of wider distribution. That compared to 35 percent in its previous poll.
A Lopez Obrador victory could usher in a Mexican government less accommodating toward the United States, where President Donald Trump has stoked trade tensions with Mexico and aggressively moved to curb immigration.
Lopez Obrador has backed the North American Free Trade Agreement, but his plan to review newly issued oil contracts sparked worries he will deter foreign investment.
One of the factors that appeared to extend his lead was the expulsion of two independent hopefuls from the ballot for not reaching the required number of signatures. 
The previous poll is not an exact comparison because it included the now-disqualified candidates.
Neither second-place Ricardo Anaya nor third-place Jose Antonio Meade showed any sign of catching up with former Mexico City mayor Lopez Obrador.
""Lopez Obrador is breaking his ceiling ... he's growing in a way that wasn't expected,"" Parametria founder Francisco Abundis said.
Anaya, running for the right-left ""For Mexico in Front"" coalition, holds 20 percent of vote preferences, compared with 21 percent in the previous poll.
Former finance minister Meade, running for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), stood still on 16 percent of the vote, while independent candidate Margarita Zavala rose to 13 percent of the vote from 10 percent previously.
The youngest candidate, Anaya, 39, launched his campaign on Thursday, pitching himself as a forward-thinking alternative both to the unpopular PRI and Lopez Obrador's personalized leadership.
Meade's launch on Sunday highlighted his experience in government under two different political parties, unusual in Mexican politics.
But the focus was mostly on silver-haired Lopez Obrador, who struck a more nationalistic tone in his speech in the border city of Ciudad Juarez, demanding respect from U.S. President Donald Trump.
He also repeated a promise to cancel Mexico City's new $13 billion airport, the country's largest infrastructure project.
All major polls show Lopez Obrador far ahead, with most showing his lead growing, although Parametria gives him the widest advantage. One poll in March put Meade in second place, although most show Anaya ahead of him.
Attention has turned to which party will hold sway in the Senate and lower house of Congress, with some believing that Lopez Obrador's party, the National Regeneration Movement, could win the biggest share in both.
One game-changer could be the first television debate between the candidates on April 22.
Thirteen percent of those polled either did not answer, responded that they did not know or could not choose a candidate listed. 

The poll of 800 people had a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points. It was taken face-to-face from March 23-28, before campaigns officially started.

The Yomiuri newspaper's survey issued on Monday showed that the disapproval rating for Abe's Cabinet rose to 50 percent from early March, compared with 47.5 percent in the Kyodo news agency's survey published on Sunday.
The support rate for the Cabinet showed a slight rise to 42.4 percent in the Kyodo poll, while the Yomiuri poll showed a drop of six points to 42 percent. 
Both opinion polls were conducted between March 31-April 1.
The polls followed last week's testimony by ex-finance ministry official Nobuhisa Sagawa, who said neither Abe nor his wife influenced the murky sales of state-owned land to a school operator or the finance ministry's altering of documents about the deal.  

The slide in Abe's ratings has clouded his prospects of winning a third three-year term as president of his Liberal Democratic Party, a victory that would set him on track to become Japan's longest-serving premier. Abe has been prime minister since 2012.

The ""vast majority"" of the craft burnt up on re-entry, at around 8:15 a.m. (0015 GMT), the authority said in a brief statement on its website, without saying exactly where any pieces might have landed.
Brad Tucker, an astrophysicist at Australian National University, said the remnants of Tiangong-1 appeared to have landed about 100 km (62 miles) northwest of Tahiti.
""Small bits definitely will have made it to the surface,"" he told Reuters, adding that while about 90 percent would have burnt up in the atmosphere and just 10 percent made it to the ground, that fraction still amounted to 700 kg (1,543 lb) to 800 kg (1,764 lb).
""Most likely the debris is in the ocean, and even if people stumbled over it, it would just look like rubbish in the ocean and be spread over a huge area of thousands of square kilometers.""
China said on Friday it was unlikely any large pieces would reach the ground. 
The United States Air Force 18th Space Control Squadron, which tracks and detects all artificial objects in Earth's orbit, said it had also tracked the Tiangong-1 in its re-entry over the South Pacific.
It said in a statement it had confirmed re-entry in coordination with counterparts in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea and Britain.
The 10.4-metre-long (34.1-foot) Tiangong-1, or ""Heavenly Palace 1"", was launched in 2011 to carry out docking and orbit experiments as part of China's ambitious space program, which aims to place a permanent station in orbit by 2023.Decommissioning was originally planned for 2013 but the mission was repeatedly extended.
Asked about the space station, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular briefing he had no other information and reiterated that China had been reporting the situation to the U.N. space agency in an open and transparent way. 
""According to what I understand, at present there has not been found any damage on the ground,” he said, without elaborating.
China had earlier said re-entry would happen in late 2017, but that process was delayed, leading some experts to suggest the space laboratory was out of control.
Worldwide media hype about the re-entry reflected overseas ""envy"" of China's space industry, the Chinese tabloid Global Times said on Monday. 

""It's normal for spacecraft to re-enter the atmosphere, yet Tiangong-1 received so much attention, partly because some Western countries are trying to hype and sling mud at China's fast-growing aerospace industry,"" it said.

101,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>","Ex-Guatemala dictator Rios Montt, plagued by genocide charges, dies","By Sofia Menchu
GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Former Guatemalan military dictator Efrain Rios Montt, hounded by charges of genocide for decades, died on Sunday aged 91, leaving bitter memories of his bloody stewardship of the Central American nation during its civil war.
Thousands of mostly rural Maya civilians were victims of massacre, rape and torture under a ""scorched earth"" policy implemented during his 17-month rule between 1982 and 1983 at the height of the Cold War-era conflict.
Rios Montt, diagnosed with senile dementia in 2015, faced a new genocide trial in 2017 overseen by a Supreme Court tribunal that was ongoing at the time of his death.
On Sunday, his lawyer Luis Rosales said the former dictator maintained his innocence up to his death. 
In May 2013, a court found Rios Montt guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity, prompting Amnesty International to hail the proceedings as the trial of the decade.
But just 10 days afterwards, the country's top court quashed the conviction on a technicality after persistent efforts by his defense team to derail the trial with complex appeals.
Rios Montt took power in a bloodless coup in 1982 and founded the right-wing Guatemalan Republican Front party.
An evangelical Protestant, Rios Montt was overthrown in August 1983, but served in Congress for nearly two decades until he stepped down in 2012. At a stroke, he lost the immunity granted by law to public officials and became open to prosecution for atrocities committed under his rule.
In January 2012, a Guatemalan court charged Rios Montt for conceiving a counterinsurgency plan that killed at least 1,771 members of the Ixil tribe and displaced thousands more. One year later, a judge ordered him to stand trial for the bloodshed.
The former dictator took the witness stand hours before his conviction, telling the court he had never committed genocide.
""My job as head of state was national policy. I was not commanding troops,"" said Rios Montt, then 86.
Human rights activists in Spain also sought to charge Rios Montt with war crimes in Spanish courts.
Critics likened Rios Montt to other Latin American presidents who ruled with an iron hand, like Chile's Augusto Pinochet and Peru's Alberto Fujimori.
But at the time his regime received open support from U.S. President Ronald Reagan, who believed Guatemala faced a serious challenge from leftist guerrillas suspected of being in alliance with Cold War communists.
An estimated 200,000, mostly Maya, civilians were killed during the 1960-1996 war and another 45,000 went missing.
A United Nations-backed truth commission report released after the 1996 peace accords found that the army and paramilitary groups were responsible for over 90 percent of more than 400 massacres during the war.
CAREER SOLDIER
Born on June 16, 1926 in Guatemala's rural western highland department of Huehuetenango, Rios Montt was the third of 11 children and became fascinated with the army at an early age.
Joining the military academy in 1943, he participated in the 1954 U.S. Central Intelligence Agency-backed military coup that ousted democratically elected President Jacobo Arbenz who was seen by the United States as a communist sympathizer.
That coup eventually ignited the brutal civil war, pitting a string of right-wing governments against leftist guerillas.
Rios Montt rose to the rank of general in 1972 and sought the presidency in 1974, losing to rival Kjell Eugenio Laugerud, the handpicked successor of the incumbent.
He went into exile, serving in Spain as the Guatemalan military attaché, before returning home in 1977 where he was introduced to the evangelical Church of the Word, eventually becoming a lay minister.
On March 23, 1982, Rios Montt headed a junta which removed President Angel Guevara from power, denouncing the elections earlier in the month as fraudulent. Declaring his presidency to be the ""will of God,"" Rios Montt annulled the constitution, dissolved Congress and suspended political parties.
He lost little time in reviewing the government's anti-insurgency measures, opting for a crackdown that led to tens of thousands of deaths, tortures and displacements of Guatemala's rural population suspected of aiding leftist rebels.
""If you are with us, we'll feed you, if not, we'll kill you,"" he famously told a crowd of indigenous Maya in July 1982.
Such pronouncements did not prevent Reagan from describing Rios Montt as ""a man of great personal integrity"" who was ""totally committed to democracy.""
In the 1990s Rios Montt tried twice to run for president but was blocked by a constitutional clause that prevented anyone who had taken part in a military coup from becoming head of state.
He settled for a seat in Congress instead, and went on to serve as president of the legislature.
Rios Montt tried again for the presidency in 2003 and when denied the chance, called on his supporters to take to the streets in protest. Two days of rioting now known as Black Thursday and Friday of Mourning erupted in the capital as protesters torched cars and buildings and shot out windows.

The courts eventually let the former general stand as a candidate, but he came a distant third in the race.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Former Guatemalan military dictator Efrain Rios Montt died at the age of 91 on Sunday, a bitterly divisive figure in the country's long civil war who escaped a 2013 genocide conviction only to face renewed charges last year.
At the time of his death, which his lawyer Luis Rosales announced, Rios Montt was again on trial for genocide for his role during one of the bloodiest phases of the Cold War-era conflict that lasted from 1960 until 1996.
""He died facing justice,"" said on Twitter Claudia Paz y Paz, a former Guatemalan attorney general who was instrumental in bringing charges against members of the military accused of committing atrocities during the civil war.
""Thank you to the survivors for their dignity and bravery. May it never happen again,"" Paz y Paz added.
Ruling Guatemala from 1982 to 1983, Rios Montt was in 2013 convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity, to the relief of many victims' families. Then, barely a week later, judges at the country's top court threw out the sentence.
President Jimmy Morales, whose party has strong ties to the military, expressed his condolences to Rios Montt's family, while other leaders on the right also paid their respects.
Former conservative President Alfonso Portillo, a party colleague of Rios Montt's who was convicted of money laundering in 2014, said he had valued the retired general as a friend.
""I learnt a lot from him and his life is part of our history,"" he said, noting the two had also their differences.
An evangelical Protestant, Rios Montt served in Congress for nearly two decades and stepped down in 2012, putting an end to the immunity he enjoyed by law as a public official.
A Guatemalan court in January 2012 charged him for conceiving a counterinsurgency plan that killed at least 1,771 members of the Ixil tribe and displaced thousands more.
His lawyer Rosales said on Sunday that Rios Montt maintained he was innocent of genocide until the end.
An estimated 200,000, mostly Maya civilians were killed during the war, and a further 45,000 went missing.
Born on June 16, 1926 in Guatemala's rural western highland department of Huehuetenango, Rios Montt took part in the 1954 U.S. Central Intelligence Agency-backed military coup that ousted democratically elected President Jacobo Arbenz, who was seen by the United States as a communist sympathizer.
Rios Montt was a general by 1972 and two years later ran for the presidency. He lost and went to Spain, serving as military attache, then returned to Guatemala in 1977. In March 1982, he headed a junta which removed President Angel Guevara from power.
Rios Montt was diagnosed with senile dementia in 2015, and a new genocide trial overseen by a Supreme Court tribunal began against him in 2017. The process was ongoing when he died.
Hector Reyes, a lawyer for victims' families, said the genocide trial would continue because another general, Jose Rodriguez Sanchez, was still facing charges. Rios Montt's death meant that he was no longer part of the process, he added.
Rigoberta Menchu, a Guatemalan activist and Nobel peace laureate who fought for victims of the conflict, said the death of the general would now give some a measure of closure.

""Either way, for us, the victims, he has already been judged, and the crimes have been set out,"" she said.

In a televised speech, Suu Kyi made only a passing reference to the crisis in Rakhine state, where her government faces mounting international condemnation for a military operation against Rohingya Muslims that has sent nearly 700,000 members of the minority community fleeing to Bangladesh.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate has also struggled to match the sky-high expectations that swept her National League for Democracy (NLD) to power in 2016, and is struggling to rebut criticism over slower economic growth and continued fighting with ethnic armed groups. 
In the televised address, Suu Kyi urged people to be united. ""The world's focus in on Rakhine right now, but we also need to peacefully develop the country.""
""We are facing challenges from inside and outside of the country, as we are struggling to develop politics, society and economy,"" she said.
She also urged people to ""respect the intentions and vision of the international community."" She did not elaborate. 
The civilian government led by Suu Kyi has no control over the military, which launched the crackdown in Rakhine in response to insurgent attacks on security forces in August.
The United States and United Nations have described the operation as ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, which Myanmar denies. 
Suu Kyi also talked about her number one priority - to end decades of fighting between ethnic rebels and the military, which has kept Myanmar in a state of near-perpetual civil war since independence in 1948.
""While building peace and stability is the most important requirement for our country, we need the strength of unity,"" she said. 
Two ethnic armed groups in Myanmar signed a ceasefire with the government in February as Suu Kyi sought to revive the stuttering peace process. The Buddhist-majority country has seen the worst fighting with rebels in years since she took office. 

Myanmar on Friday swore in a close ally of Suu Kyi as the country's new president after the outgoing president retired. Analysts said the move was unlikely to affect a delicate balance of power between Suu Kyi and the military. [nL3N1R94QS]

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Tensions mounted over the fatal police shooting of an unarmed Sacramento, California, black man when a protester sustained minor injuries when struck by a sheriff's patrol car that was under attack by demonstrators, authorities said on Sunday.
About 150 people demonstrated in Sacramento on Saturday night to protest the March 18 shooting death of Stephon Clark, 22, who was gunned down in his grandmother's yard. 
The death of Clark, a father of two, was the latest in a string of killings of black men by police that have triggered street protests and fueled a renewed national debate about bias in the U.S. criminal justice system.
Protesters on Saturday night surrounded two marked Sacramento County Sheriff's Department patrol cars and ""began yelling while pounding and kicking the vehicles' exterior,"" the Sheriff's Department said in a statement early Sunday. 
""A collision occurred involving the sheriff's patrol vehicle and a protester who was walking in the roadway,"" the statement said. ""The patrol car was traveling at slow speeds.""
The protester was identified by local media as Wanda Cleveland, 61, who regularly attends Sacramento City Council meetings. 
The protester was transported by the Sacramento Metro Fire Department to a hospital, where she was treated for minor injuries, the Sheriff's Department said. 
""Vandals in the crowd"" damaged the patrol car, which ""sustained scratches, dents, and a shattered rear window,"" the Sheriff's Department said.
Demonstrators interviewed by local radio and television stations, who prompted a flurry of similar Twitter responses, said the sheriff's car failed to stop and called the incident a hit-and-run accident. 
The incident is under investigation by the Sheriff's Department and the California Highway Patrol.
Saturday's demonstration brought together a multi-racial crowd, many in it holding signs such as ""Stop Police Rage"" and ""Power to the People."" It was led by retired National Basketball Association player Matt Barnes, who grew up in the area and had two stints with the Sacramento Kings franchise. 
Clark was shot by police responding to a report that someone was breaking windows. Police said the officers feared he had a gun but that he was later found to have been holding a cellphone.
Police have said he was moving toward officers in a menacing way. The shooting was captured on a body cam video released by police.

In several days of sporadic protests, protesters have blocked traffic and twice delayed fans from reaching games played by the Kings at the Golden 1 Center.

""We have agreed that settling the maritime issues is extremely important for the healthy and sustainable development of bilateral relations,"" he told reporters after a meeting with Vietnamese Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Pham Binh Minh in Hanoi.
China claims 90 percent of the potentially energy-rich maritime territory and has been building on and militarizing rocky outcrops and reefs in its waters.
Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also lay claim to parts of it, through which about $5 trillion of trade passes each year. Vietnam is the country most openly at odds with China over the issue.
""The two sides should better manage disputes through talks and refrain from taking unilateral actions that may further complicate and expand the disputes,"" Wang said.
""At the same time, (the two sides) should promote cooperation at the sea, including holding talks on joint exploitation.""
Wang and Minh said bilateral relations had seen positive development, with rising trade and investment as the two neighbors further opened up markets to each other. Bilateral trade exceeded $100 billion last year.

Minh said Vietnam and China shared responsibility to maintain peace and stability in the region, reiterating Vietnam's stance that the maritime disputes must be resolved peacefully manner and according to international law.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his wife, Ri Sol Ju, were among the hundreds in Pyongyang on Sunday watching South Korean K-pop singers perform in the North for the first time in more than a decade as tensions between the old rivals thaw.
It was the first time a North Korean leader had attended a South Korean performance in the North's capital. Kim was seen clapping in time to the music and later took photographs with the performers.
""Our dear leader comrade said his heart swelled and he was moved by the sight of his people deepen their understanding of South Korean popular culture and cheer with sincerity,"" the North's KCNA state media said.
The audience cheered and sang along to songs during the two-hour concert and the South Korean performers were later presented with bouquets. 
""(Kim Jong Un) showed much interest during the show and asked questions about the songs and lyrics,"" Culture Minister Do Jong-whan told reporters after the show.
Tension over North Korea's tests of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile surged last year and raised fears of U.S. military action in response to North Korea's threat to develop a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United States.
But tension has eased significantly since North Korea decided to send athletes to the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February. The neighbours are technically still at war after the 1950-53 conflict ended with a ceasefire, not a truce.
The performance coincided with the beginning of annual joint South Korean-U.S. military drills, which have previously been met with denunciations and missile launches by the North. The exercises were delayed and shortened this year in order not to spoil the Olympic detente.
The two Koreas have set a date for their first summit in more than a decade on April 27, and Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump could meet in May.
The concert, billed as ""Spring is Coming"", was put on a the East Pyongyang Grand Theatre by an lineup of top South Korean performers including veteran vocalists Cho Yong-pil, Lee Sun-hee, rock star Yoon Do-hyun and singer Baek Ji-young, as well as K-pop girl band Red Velvet.
Echoing the concert theme, Kim said the performance had brought a ""spring of peace"" to the two Koreas, and expressed wishes for a ""prosperous autumn"", according to the North's news agency.
The North Korean leader appeared in a group photograph with the performers, distributed by North Korean media. He was also seen talking to members of Red Velvet, who have more than 4.6 million followers on Instagram.
The South Korean delegation travelled to Pyongyang on Saturday in a reciprocal cultural visit after North Korea sent performers to the South in February, the South's Culture Ministry said. 
A taekwondo performance was staged earlier on Sunday.
BANNED MEDIA
The images of Kim posing and laughing with South Korean pop stars and applauding in the stands contrasts with reports from North Korean defectors who say he has overseen a crackdown on anyone caught listening to foreign media.
""North Korean refugees overwhelmingly and consistently report that it has become more dangerous to consume foreign media under Kim Jong Un’s crackdowns,"" Sokeel Park, the South Korea country director for refugee aid organisation Liberty in North Korea, said on Twitter.
A 2015 survey of North Korean refugees by the U.S. government's Broadcasting Board of Governors found that 77 percent of respondents said it had become more dangerous to listen to foreign radio under Kim.
South Korean movies were often reported to be especially taboo compared with Chinese films, according to a report by the InterMedia consultancy group, with North Koreans facing prison time if caught.
Seohyun, an actress and vocalist with South Korean girl group Girls' Generation, sang a North Korean pop song called ""Blue Willow Tree"". She had performed with the North's Samjiyon Orchestra in Seoul in February.
Cho Yong-pil, 68, sang a string of hits including ""The Cafe in the Winter"", ""Short Hair"" and ""Let's Go on a Trip"". Cho staged a solo concert in Pyongyang in 2005 - the last concert by a South Korean artist in the North before Sunday's performance.
The same South Korean singers will hold another concert with North Korean performers on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Kim Yong Chol, North Korea's former intelligence chief who now handles inter-Korean affairs, met South Korean journalists on Monday to apologise for the fact they were unable to cover the concert after being invited to the country do so.
Kim ""asked pardon"" from the ""valued guests"".
""Having invited South Korean journalists to the North, we have a duty to ensure that you can gather news freely and film comfortably"", Kim was quoted as saying.

Kim said the journalists' inability to cover the concert stemmed from a breakdown in cooperation between Kim Jong Un's security detail and concert organisers.

Amos Chanda said ambassador Nelson Pages Vilas spoke at the party's launch on Saturday.
Political tensions were rekindled in Zambia last month when the country's main opposition party, the United Party for National Development (UPND), filed a motion seeking to impeach President Edgar Lungu over accusations of breaching the constitution.
The UPND challenged Lungu's 2016 election victory in court, alleging fraud, arguing that that obliged him to hand over power to parliament's speaker until the court considered its petition.
Lungu has denied electoral fraud.
He directed that the Cuban ambassador be recalled ""for behavior unbecoming of a diplomat,"" Chanda told a media briefing, adding that diplomatic ties with Cuba would be retained.
Reuters was not immediately able to contact the ambassador for comment.

Al Shabaab militants attacked an African Union (AU) peacekeeper base in the town of Bulamarer, 130 kilometers southwest of the capital Mogadishu, around 9 a.m. local time, residents from the area told Reuters.
Since withdrawing from Mogadishu in 2011, the al Qaeda-linked group has lost control of most of Somalia's cities and towns. But it still retains a strong presence in regions outside the capital.
The militants initially detonated two suicide car bombs that hit one AU vehicle and one Somali military vehicle, Somali army major Farah Osman, who is stationed near the AMISOM (African Union Mission in Somalia) base, said. 
""Then a large number of al Shabaab fighters began firing from under the trees ... it was a hellish battle,"" he said, adding there was an unknown number of casualties.
Militants on foot then attacked nearby villages, said Ali Nur, deputy governor of the Lower Shabelle region where the base is located. ""They were repulsed, but all these attacks were to stop reinforcement.""
The phone of the spokesman for the AMISOM force based in Mogadishu was switched off on Sunday and Reuters was unable to reach any other officials from the force for comment.
The Ugandan army said in a statement that Ugandan soldiers serving in the AU peacekeeping mission killed 22 al Shabaab militants that had attacked the Bulamarer base and two other posts, all in the Lower Shabelle region. Four Ugandan soldiers were killed, the army said.
Abdiasis Abu Musab, a spokesman for al Shabaab said 14 of the group's fighters and 59 AMISOM troops were killed in the incident. 
Nur, the government official, said no soldiers from the Somali army were killed and was not sure if any AMISOM troops were killed.
A police major stationed in a nearby town also said two car bombs exploded outside the base before the al Shabaab fighters entered it. 
Major Nur Ali told Reuters that Somali and AMISOM forces had attacked al Shabaab in rural areas near the base on Saturday night. ""Then al Shabaab attacked this morning as a revenge,"" he said.
Somalia has been mired in civil war since 1991.

Conservative German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Maas have joined the United States and other European countries in standing with Britain in a major standoff over the attack on former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter.
Maas, a member of the Social Democrats (SPD) who are split on how tough to be on Moscow, told Bild am Sonntag much trust had been lost in the last few years due to Russia's behavior.
""At the same time, we need Russia as a partner to settle regional conflicts, for disarmament and as an important pillar of multilateralism,"" he was quoted as saying in the paper.
""We are therefore open for dialogue and are trying to rebuild trust bit by bit if Russia is ready.""
He also, however, defended the decision to expel diplomats. ""to show solidarity with Britain but also as a signal of unity"".
In the last week, as part of mass expulsions on both sides, Germany expelled four Russian diplomats and Moscow has reciprocated with the same number, prompting talk of a crisis in relations between Russia and the West. 
Some Social Democrats have urged the 'grand coalition' of their party and Merkel's conservatives to ensure a new Cold War does not start, and business groups are also worried.
Germany relies on Russia for roughly a third of the gas it uses and, before Western states imposed sanctions on Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Europe's biggest economy exported about 38 billion euros of goods to Russia. 

London accuses Moscow of being responsible for the first known use of a military-grade nerve agent on European soil since World War Two and Germany has repeatedly called on Moscow to cooperate more with the investigations.

Some 700,000 Rohingya Muslims crossed the border from Myanmar's Rakhine State into Bangladesh after militant attacks in August sparked a military crackdown that United Nations and Western countries have said constitutes ethnic cleansing.
The boat, carrying 56 refugees, stopped on Lanta island in southern Krabi province after a heavy storm on Saturday evening. It was the first Rohingya vessel spotted off Thailand in more than a year, local police said.
""We treated them with humanitarian consideration and allowed them to return to sea because they told us they were heading to Malaysia,"" Lanta police chief, Police Colonel M.L. Pattanajak Chakrabandhu told Reuters. Locals gave the refugees food and water, he said.
Tens of thousands of Rohingya fled by sea following an outbreak of sectarian violence in Rakhine State in 2012, some falling prey to human traffickers. 
That exodus peaked in 2015, when an estimated 25,000 people fled across the Andaman Sea for Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.
Rights groups expect another surge in Rohingya boats reaching Southeast Asia, even if not at the levels of the past.
""We have received credible information about boats full of Rohingya refugees making their way to Malaysia over the last few months,"" Matthew Smith co-founder of advocacy group Fortify Rights told Reuters. ""The humanitarian situation in Bangladesh for the refugees is very difficult.""

SRINAGAR (Reuters) - Indian security forces killed at least three civilians and wounded about 70 in restive Kashmir on Sunday when hundreds of people tried to prevent them from carrying out operations against suspected militants, police and residents said.
At least 17 other people, including 13 suspected militants, were killed in gunbattles during the day in southern Kashmir, police officials said, the worst violence in the region this year.
When hundreds of people came out on the streets of Kachdoora village in Shopian district to try to halt a gunbattle between militants and security forces, troops used tear gas and pellet guns to disperse the crowd. They later opened fire. 
Local residents said that after the protests, the security forces called off the operation. Police said five militants and three soldiers were killed in the fighting.
Muslim separatists have been waging a violent campaign against Indian rule since the late 1980s in Indian-held Kashmir. 
Fighting also broke out in two other villages in the region on Sunday.
S.P. Vaid, the state director general of police, said the army received information on Saturday night about militants hiding in an area near Dragad village, about 50 km (30 miles) south of Kashmir's capital of Srinagar and also in Shopian district.
""In Dragad, 7 bodies of militants were recovered including top commanders. They were killed in a gunbattle,"" Vaid said, adding that the owner of the house in which the militants were trapped was also killed. 
Another militant was killed in Dialgam village in Anantnag district, about 60 km (37 miles) south of Srinagar, while one was caught alive, he said.
Authorities have directed schools and colleges in Kashmir to remain closed on Monday to prevent any recurrence of violence, and restrictions have been imposed in several areas. 
Train services to south Kashmir have been suspended as a precautionary measure, a railways official said, and internet services in five districts have also been blocked. 

In south Kashmir's Pulwama district the local administration has imposed restrictions on the movement of people and vehicles to prevent any violence.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis, in his Easter address on Sunday, called for peace in the Holy Land two days after 15 Palestinians were killed on the Israeli-Gaza border, saying the conflict there ""does not spare the defenseless"".
The pope made his appeal in his ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) message from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica to tens of thousands of people in the flower-bedecked square below where he earlier celebrated a Mass.
He also appealed for an end to the ""carnage"" in Syria, calling for humanitarian aid to be allowed to enter, and for peace in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Francis appeared to refer directly to the Gaza violence last Friday, calling for ""reconciliation for the Holy Land, also experiencing in these days the wounds of ongoing conflict that do not spare the defenseless.""
Israel's defense minister has rejected calls for an inquiry into the killings by the military during a Palestinian demonstration that turned violent at the Gaza-Israel border. 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Federica Mogherini, the European Union's foreign policy chief, and other leaders have called for an independent investigation into the bloodshed.
The Pope also begged for peace for ""the entire world, beginning with the beloved and long-suffering land of Syria, whose people are worn down by an apparently endless war.""
""This Easter, may the light of the risen Christ illumine the consciences of all political and military leaders, so that a swift end may be brought to the carnage in course ... "" he said.
He spoke a day after the Syrian army command said it had regained most of the towns and villages in eastern Ghouta. Tens of thousands of people have now evacuated once-bustling towns in the suburbs east of the capital, which had nearly 2 million people before the start of the conflict and were major commercial and industrial hubs. 
Francis called for international assistance for Venezuela, so that more people would not have to abandon their homeland because of the economic and political crisis.
He hoped the ""fruits of dialogue"" would advance peace and harmony on the Korean peninsula, where the two sides are set to hold their first summit in more than a decade on April 27, after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pledged his commitment to denuclearisation. 
Francis, celebrating his sixth Easter as Roman Catholic leader since his election in 2013, urged his listeners to work for an end to the ""so many acts of injustice"" in the world.

He prayed the power of Jesus' message ""bears fruits of hope and dignity where there are deprivation and exclusion, hunger and unemployment, where there are migrants and refugees - so often rejected by today’s culture of waste - and victims of the drug trade, human trafficking and contemporary forms of slavery"".

Retired teacher Mokgweetsi Masisi, who takes over from former army general Ian Khama, inherits a state with a reputation as one of Africa's rare political and economic success stories.
But he faces a huge task in attempting to reduce its dependence on the diamond trade while creating more jobs after collapsing commodity prices tipped it into recession in 2015.
""We still seek to build a Botswana in which sustained development is underpinned by economic diversification,"" Masisi told a cheering crowd in parliament. ""One of my top priorities ... will be to address the problem of unemployment especially amongst the young.""
Botswana, with a population of some 2 million, has a jobless rate of around 20 percent, with youth unemployment thought to be much higher.
Khama, 65, and a son of the country first president Seretse, bowed out after two five-year terms in a scripted succession that compelled him to hand over power to his deputy.
Masisi becomes only Botswana's third leader outside the Khama dynasty since its independence from Britain in 1966. 
As part of efforts to branch out of diamonds, he also said his government would scale up access to technical education and set up initiatives in tourism, mining, beef and financial services. 
CHALLENGING TIMES
But the country's opposition predicted little change, saying Masisi as deputy president was instrumental in an economic strategy that had failed to adapt the economy to the needs of a new generation of finance and science graduates. 
""There is no need to celebrate, the change of guard will just be cosmetic. As vice president he... failed even at the time he was at the ministry of education,"" said a spokesman for the UDC opposition coalition, Moeti Mohwasa.
After working for United Nations Children's Fund, Masisi became a lawmaker in 2009. He served as a minister of public affairs from 2011 to 2014, when Khama named him minister of education and, later the same year, also vice president. 
Viewed by the markets as more business-friendly than his predecessor, Masisi will serve as leader until national elections in October 2019, for which the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) is expected to name him as its presidential candidate.

The BDP has governed the country since independence but for the first time won less than 50 percent of the vote for the legislature in the previous election in 2014. Polls suggest its share will fall further in next year's ballot.

114,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2018 10:52PM ET</span>",Last eastern Ghouta rebels poised to surrender: Syrian state media,"By Suleiman Al-Khalidi
AMMAN (Reuters) - The group in control of the last rebel bastion near Damascus appeared on Sunday to have agreed a deal for its fighters to make peace with the government or quit the eastern Ghouta enclave, Syrian state media said.
Jaish al Islam, most of whose members are drawn from the area, has been defending the city of Douma against a months-long onslaught by government forces. 
If confirmed, its surrender or departure for rebel-held areas in northwest Syria would herald an end to large-scale conflict in the enclave.
State television and Syrian newspapers said information indicated that, under the deal, the group would hand over heavy and mid-sized weapons and acknowledge the restoration of state sovereignty over Douma.
A Hezbollah run-media unit said on Sunday an agreement had been reached after several days of negotiations to spare bloodshed in Douma.
The unit of the powerful Lebanese Shi'ite militia that has been fighting with the Syrian army said among the terms of the deal was setting up a Syrian government-approved local council to run the city's affairs after rebels withdraw.
It also said a Russian-led committee with representatives from Turkey, Iran and Russia, the three guarantors of the Astana peace talks who set up ""de-escalation"" zones across Syria, would be responsible for handing over prisoners of war jailed by the rebels.
Jaish al Islam had no immediate comment on the reports but responded to earlier claims by the Syrian government that it was negotiating a deal to stay and not to pull out of the city.
The government lost control of Douma, the largest urban center in the eastern suburbs of Damascus in insurgent hands, in the early phase of Syria's civil war, now in its eighth year.
If confirmed, the agreement with Jaish al Islam would mirror others reached by insurgents following heavy bombing of areas under their control by government forces and Russian jets that has killed hundreds of civilians.
Late on Saturday, negotiators reached a deal to evacuate wounded Jaish al Islam civilians and fighters to Idlib in the northwest. 
A group of stranded fighters from another insurgent group, Failaq al Rahman, who had fled to Douma from advancing army troops at the start of the latest campaign, left the city on Sunday, state media said. 
Syria's state news agency SANA said 24 buses carrying around 1,200 fighters from Failaq al Rahman and their families left Douma on Sunday in the first such pullout of fighters.
On Saturday the rebel group concluded a week-long evacuation of thousands of its fighters from areas it had controlled in other parts of the enclave.
SEEKING A WAY OUT
A political official in Jaish al Islam denied they had agreed to evacuate Douma and said the government-inspired reports were stepped up psychological warfare aimed at forcing them to capitulate.
""Jaish al Islam has taken the decision to remain steadfast and the idea of leaving is not on the table,"" said the official.
Opposition sources say Jaish al Islam officials have been desperately trying to strike a deal that would bring Russian military police into Douma, and let the group keep a role in maintaining internal security but under the state's overall jurisdiction.
Russian military officers negotiating with Jaish al Islam told the group it accepted such an arrangement but the Syrian government remained against it, a senior opposition source familiar with the talks said.
Russia, a key ally of President Bashar al-Assad, was behind the main battle plan, directing elite forces and militias on the ground and calling in air strikes from Syrian and Russian warplanes, two Western intelligence sources based in the region told Reuters this week.
The Syrian army last week warned the insurgents to surrender or face a military assault to drive them out.
The Syrian army command said on Saturday it had regained most of the towns and villages in eastern Ghouta and was pressing its military operations in Douma.
The city's fall would seal the rebels' worst defeat since 2016.
The once bustling commercial hub on the outskirts of the capital was the main center of street protests in the Damascus suburbs against Assad's one party rule that ignited the conflict more than seven years ago. 
A resident reached by phone described a sense of foreboding among those still in the besieged city.
""The fear is of the unknown and not bombardment or hunger ... what the coming days will bring we cannot predict,"" said the resident, Bilal Bwaidani.
Defense analysts say a major goal of the government's campaign was to complete a security belt around the capital, where for years rebels dug into a network of tunnels and well-fortified positions resisted countless offensives to seize the enclave.

Many of the predominantly Sunni Muslim inhabitants of eastern Ghouta say they fear their displacement was part of a deliberate attempt to bring demographic changes in strategic areas that dilutes their presence in favor of Assad's Alawite sect and other minorities.

President Ashraf Ghani, his credibility on the line with both Afghan voters and increasingly impatient international partners, has vowed to hold the elections before presidential elections next year.
But the elections, now three years late, have been repeatedly postponed and have been again pushed by from a July date announced last year as political disputes and wrangling over voter registration have blocked progress.
""Today the Independent Election Commission officially announces to the people of Afghanistan that the election will be held on (Oct. 20),"" IEC Chairman Gula Jan Abdul Badi Sayad told a news conference.
International partners, desperate for signs of progress 17 years after the ousting of the Taliban, have exerted heavy pressure on the Kabul government and political groups to ensure the success of the elections.
But the vote, seen as a dry run before the even more important presidential election next year, has faced repeated delays and questions over the commitment of the Afghan political class to its success.
An ambitious biometric registration system originally envisaged as a means of avoiding the massive voter fraud that marred previous ballots including the 2014 presidential election was abandoned last year.
But a major push to register voters, many of whom have no national identity papers, will need to succeed for the vote to be broad-based enough to be accepted as legitimate.
With time pressing, voters must be issued with identity papers under a strict timetable and registered in the voting centres where they will cast their ballot, a move aimed at reducing the scope for multiple voting.
Tadamichi Yamamoto, head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said the announcement of a firm election date would allow authorities to move from planning to implementation.
""The participation of all Afghans in the electoral process, not merely the elections themselves, is critical,"" he said in a statement.
The IEC, the body overseeing the process, said it was confident the vote could go ahead this year despite the difficulties in areas controlled by the Taliban.
""Afghan security forces have assured us they will carry out operations in insecure areas not in government control and to ensure security for people in the voter registration and voting stages of the election,"" Sayad said.
If the vote cannot be held by October, Afghanistan's harsh geography and climate mean that the process will be delayed for the winter, meaning the vote may not be able to be held before the presidential elections.
However, time is very tight and the process could be easily derailed, said one Western official, who follows the process closely and who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.

""There's maybe a few days flexibility but no more than that.""

GARART AL-GATEF, Libya (Reuters) - The wind whips up sand storms in Garart al-Gatef. Snakes and scorpions lurk amongst the desert scrub. 
But hundreds of people who were stranded while trying to return to a town emptied in an act of collective punishment during Libya's 2011 revolution have sworn to stay put here until they are allowed home.
The makeshift camp of 250 tents sprang up in early February after armed groups from the city of Misrata blocked convoys of displaced families trying to approach Tawergha, a town of about 40,000 that still lies in ruins.
In doing so, they thwarted – at least temporarily – a landmark reconciliation effort to resolve a case that has symbolized the political and communal divisions which surfaced during and after Libya's uprising. 
It was forces from Misrata that chased Tawergha's residents from their homes more than six years ago, accusing them of supporting a military siege of their city by Muammar Gaddafi, part of his failed attempt to crush the NATO-backed revolt that overthrew him. 
Tawergha's residents, many of them the dark-skinned descendants of sub-Saharan African slaves, have since been scattered in squalid camps across Libya. 
After long negotiations, they were told by the internationally recognized government in Tripoli that they could start moving back on February 1. Officials had even ordered 3,000 meals and a stage for a ceremony in Tawergha, said Mustafa Ghrema, a town council member living at Garart al-Gtaf. Diggers had started clearing some of the land.
But repeated attempts to approach Tawergha and set up camp there were blocked by a combination of uniformed forces and militiamen in civilian clothes, some of whom opened fire, Ghrema said.
'ABUSE'
""The militiamen who shot at us were not the same as the first group, who appeared to be organized military forces. They talked to us with respect and told us it was a problem and we could be exposed to danger,"" he said. 
""The militias used racist words, abuse and repugnant terms, and fired on us.""
Nearly 200 families settled on the roadside at Garart al-Gatef, about 27 km (17 miles) from Tawergha. A smaller number trying to return from Benghazi were blocked east of Tawergha.
Local and international aid agencies are now delivering food, water and medical assistance at Garart al-Gatef. A nursery has been up in one large tent, and some young children are being bussed to a local school. 
But conditions are harsh. ""You can see the wind for yourselves. It's difficult to describe what the dust does to your eyes,"" said Ghazala Awad, 41, as she stood allocating tents to families at the camp. ""Sometimes we can't even hear, and it doesn't make a difference if you put a scarf on.""
Tawergha, about 200 km south-east of Tripoli, is an eerie collection of bombed-out, abandoned buildings that have been left all but untouched.
The U.N. concluded that the town was deliberately destroyed in 2011 in order to make it uninhabitable, and said Misrata's militias had committed crimes against humanity. 
For the past few weeks, the Tripoli government and the United Nations have both been pushing to resolve the standoff. 
The camp's residents say they will only go in one direction.
""These camps are temporary, not permanent,"" said Salem Ibrahim, 61, a retired teacher who arrived at Garart al-Gatef in a convoy from Tripoli.

""We will not relinquish our land and our home and the soil we grew up on. We will stay here until we return.""

GAZA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's defense minister rejected on Sunday calls for an inquiry into the killing of 15 Palestinians by the military during a Palestinian demonstration that turned violent on Friday at the Gaza-Israel border.
Hamas, the dominant Palestinian group in Gaza, said five of the dead were members of its armed wing. Israel said eight of the 15 belonged to Hamas, designated a terrorist group by Israel and the West, and two others came from other militant factions.
A tense calm descended on Sunday on the border area, where hundreds of Palestinians, a fraction of the tens of thousands who initially turned out, remained in tent encampments along the fenced 65-km (40-mile) border.
Organizers expect many to come back on Friday, when schools and businesses are closed for the Muslim sabbath, and rejoin the planned six-week protest pressing for right of return for refugees and their descendents to what is now Israel.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the European Union's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, have called for an independent investigation into Friday's bloodshed.
Pope Francis, in an apparent reference to the events in Gaza in his Easter address, called for ""reconciliation for the Holy Land, also experiencing in these days the wounds of ongoing conflict that do not spare the defenseless.""
Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli defense minister, rejected criticism of Israel's actions, saying soldiers along the Gaza frontier ""deserve a medal"" and did what was necessary to protect the border.
""As for a commission of inquiry - there won't be one,"" he told Israeli Army Radio.
The United States blocked a Kuwait-drafted U.N. Security Council statement on Saturday, diplomats said, that would have called for an independent investigation and urged restraint by all sides. 
WOUNDED
In a Gaza hospital on Sunday, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy hit by Israeli gunfire on Friday said that when he approached the border fence with others in the crowd, he thought he would be safe as long as he did not touch the barrier or throw stones.
Hundreds had ignored calls by protest organizers and by the Israeli military to stay away from the frontier. The military said some of those who were shot had fired at soldiers, rolled burning tires and hurled rocks and fire bombs toward the border.
""I was just standing there when I felt something hit my leg and it pushed me to the ground,"" the boy, Bashar Wahdan, told Reuters, estimating his distance from the fence at 30 meters (yards). The bullet cut through blood vessels and broke a bone.
At his bedside, Bashar's father said he had no idea his son had gone to the protest.
The Israeli military accused Hamas of ""cynically exploiting women and children"" by sending them to the fence. A Hamas spokesman called the allegations ""lies aimed at justifying the massacres"".
On Saturday, Israeli troops using live ammunition and rubber bullets shot and wounded about 70 Palestinians among demonstrators at the border, Palestinian officials said. Witnesses said stones were thrown at the soldiers.
Doctors at Gaza's crowded Shifa hospital said they were running out of medicine and other supplies.

The protest is scheduled to culminate on May 15, when Palestinians mark the ""Nakba"" or ""Catastrophe"" when hundreds of thousands fled or were driven out of their homes in 1948, when the state of Israel was created. Israel has long ruled out any right of return, fearing it would lose its Jewish majority.

CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexico's presidential front-runner launches his campaign close to the U.S. border on Sunday amid tension over U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to put up a wall between the countries.
If leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador wins the July 1 election, he is expected to be less accommodating toward Trump than the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has been lagging in polls because of anger over its failure to contain violence and graft. 
His three-month campaign starts in Ciudad Juarez, a tribute to the city's namesake Benito Juarez, the 19th century Mexican president from indigenous roots whose exiled government resisted a French colonialist intervention from the unruly border city.
Lopez Obrador recently criticized President Enrique Pena Nieto for ""governing with recipes sent from abroad,"" but he has lately softened his opposition to the government's policy of allowing foreign investment in the oil industry.
The ruling party candidate trailing in third place, former finance minister Jose Antonio Meade, launches his own campaign on Sunday at the other end of the country in the southeastern town of Merida.
Second-place Ricardo Anaya began campaigning on Friday. 
Silver-haired leftist Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor, first ran for president in 2006. He would seek a meeting with Trump ""as soon as possible"" a senior advisor said, while indicating foreign policy would hew less closely to U.S. regional priorities if he wins. 
Trump's tough trade policies, insults against Mexican migrants and demands for the border wall have angered ordinary Mexicans who see their country as a natural ally of the United States.
Lopez Obrador has made clear U.S.-Mexican relations will remain strong if he wins, while promising to throw Trump a ""curve ball"" and defend Mexican pride. His unconventional, and at times inconsistent, policy stances have sometimes led to comparisons with the U.S. president.
He supports the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and the United States, but has called for talks started by Trump to renegotiate the deal to be suspended until after the election. 
In a possible sign of the moderation Lopez Obrador is keen to project, Ciudad Juarez also harbored another of his heroes -- Francisco I. Madero, a wealthy, U.S.-educated, moderate leader of the Mexican revolution who tried to unite conservatives and radicals.
However, the 64-year-old continues to play to his leftist base, attacking the current government over a $13 billion airport project he says is tainted by corruption. 
He has promised to ""consult the people"" on reforms and plans to turn the presidential residence into a cultural center, sell the presidential plane and cut his salary in half.
The candidate's foreign policy advisor, Hector Vasconcelos, has said U.S. relations should be aimed at bolstering economic cooperation and that the current ties over-emphasize police and military relations. 
Vasconcelos also said Mexico would not follow the United States in sanctioning socialist Venezuela, and would refrain from foreign interference to focus on critical problems at home such as violence.
As well as its storied history, in modern times Ciudad Juarez, opposite El Paso in Texas, has been the scene of the murders of hundreds of women, many of them low-salaried workers in export factories. 
That horror, mirrored in towns across Mexico during a decade of extreme drug violence, is another reason Lopez Obrador chose the city to start campaigning, an advisor said. 
""It is a symbol of the need to heal Mexican pain,"" said senior campaign member Tatiana Clouthier. 
Angel Perez, 29, a Mexican national who lives in El Paso, said he would attend Sunday's campaign launch with his wife and two daughters, hopeful that Lopez Obrador will deliver on promises for change. 

""I think he has what it takes to put Trump in his place,"" he said.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A Thai editor faces possible criminal charges for sharing a student's ""disrespectful"" picture of historic kings wearing face masks to highlight air pollution in the northern city of Chiang Mai.
The governor of Chiang Mai told Reuters on Sunday that he believed Pim Kemasingki, editor of the Chiang Mai Citylife magazine, had breached the Computer Crime Act by sharing the picture.
""It is up to the police to gather evidence,"" Pawin Chamniprasart said.
In a letter to police, he wrote that the kings are worshipped and respected in Chiang Mai and ""using the picture with the three kings wearing masks is disrespectful.""
Thailand's cyber crime law, which criminalizes defamation and obscenity, has been widely critisized by international rights groups for curtailing freedom of expression.
Pim, a Thai-British national, said the image of the three statues wearing masks had been shared on a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page publicizing a ""Right to Breathe"" anti-air pollution rally that had later been canceled at the request of the governor.
""I shared this picture thinking it was pertinent and powerful,"" Pim told Reuters.
""For decades I've been promoting the city and loving it... so it's quite unsettling that fighting for healthy air for my fellow citizens has turned into me besmirching the city.""
Recently, Thailand has suffered from some of its worst air pollution in years.
Achariya Ruangrattanapong, a lawyer for Pim, said he was confident that sharing the picture was not a violation of the cyber crime law.
""How can this be a computer crime if it involves a picture that a child drew?"" he said.
Pawin said he was not seeking charges of royal insult against Pim. Under Thailand's strict lese majeste law, those found guilty of insulting the monarchy face up to 15 years in prison.

SAN JOSE (Reuters) - The center-left's Carlos Alvarado Quesada decisively defeated a conservative Protestant singer in Costa Rica's presidential runoff election on Sunday by promising to allow gay marriage, protecting the country's reputation for tolerance. 
A former minister and fiction writer, Quesada, 38, had 61 percent of the vote with results in from 95 percent of polling stations, a far bigger lead than predicted by opinion polls that foresaw a tight race. 
""My commitment is to a government for everybody, in equality and liberty for a more prosperous future,"" he told thousands of cheering supporters blowing horns and waving Costa Rica's red, white and blue flag.
""There is much more that unites us than divides us."" 
His rival, Alvarado Munoz, a 43-year-old former TV journalist known for religious dance songs, quickly conceded, sinking to his knees, arms raised, in front of supporters, some of them crying.
""We didn't win the election,"" he said, adding that he had congratulated his opponent in a telephone call and, in another sign of Costa Rica's cordial politics, promised to help him resolve the country's problems. 
The election had exposed divisions in the Central American tourist destination known for laid-back beach culture and pristine rainforests, but where some rural communities remain socially conservative.
It could also reflect the mood elsewhere in Latin America, where elections are being held this year in several countries that have backed same sex unions, provoking a conservative reaction.
Alvarado Quesada, until recently a minister in the outgoing government, will be the youngest president in the modern history of Costa Rica when he takes office in May. 
Also known for his student prog-rock band, he used the campaign to appeal to his country's centrist streak. His vice presidential candidate, Epsy Campbell, will be the country's first Afro-Costa Rican to serve in that role.
Opponent Alvarado Munoz had vowed to restore what he called traditional values by preventing gay marriage and restricting women's access to abortions. 
The two men took opposing positions on a January decision by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, an influential regional body based in San Jose. 
Fabricio, as supporters refer to Alvarado Munoz, called the ruling an affront to sovereignty. Threatening to remove the country from the court's jurisdiction, he shot from the margins to win the first round of voting in February. 

Quesada, by contrast, backed the court's ruling. In the campaign's final debate, he called his opponent's comments homophobic.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The governor of Russia's Kemerovo region resigned on Sunday over a mall fire that killed more than 60 after a litany of violations in safety procedures left shoppers and children trapped inside the building.
Aman Tuleyev, 73, said in a video posted on the regional administration's website that stepping down was the only course of action possible. President Vladimir Putin accepted his resignation, the Kremlin said.
""With such a heavy burden, it's impossible to work as the governor,"" said Tuleyev, who governed the region for more than two decades. ""It's morally impossible.""
Last Sunday's fire, one of the deadliest in Russia since the break-up of the Soviet Union, swept through a cinema complex and children's play area on the upper floors of the Winter Cherry shopping center in the regional capital.
Investigators said last week that fire exits had been illegally blocked, the public address system was not switched on, the alarm system was broken, and children had been locked inside cinemas.
Putin said the incident had been caused by criminal negligence and those responsible would be punished. 
On Sunday he appointed Sergei Tsivilyov, one of the region's deputy governors, to replace Tuleyev as acting governor.
Tsivilyov, 56, has served as the director of Kolmar, a coal mining and processing company, for the past four years.
""I want to tell you, residents of Kemerovo and all the region, that I will do everything for those guilty in this terrible tragedy to receive the harshest punishment,"" Tsivilyov said in a video address posted on the regional administration's website. 
On Friday, police arrested an executive with the firm that owns the shopping mall.

The calamitous way the emergency was handled stirred public anger in Kemerovo and focused attention on corruption and lax fire safety standards. Rallies commemorating the victims were held across the country, including in Moscow and St Petersburg.

Rescue operations were complete and no other casualties were likely, assistant sub-inspector Ramesh Kirade told Reuters by telephone.
While the building was old, the reason for its collapse was not immediately known, Kirade said.
According to local news reports, the building collapsed after a heavy vehicle rammed into it. 
Building collapses are common in India, where unscrupulous builders and officials often dodge regulations or overlook the need to renovate old structures. 

In August, a 117-year-old building collapsed in the financial hub of Mumbai killing at least 22 people.

China's Manned Space Agency did not specify a time when it expects the craft to re-enter the atmosphere, the statement on Sunday said. 
No one knows for sure where debris from the spacecraft may land and many experts believe much of the craft is expected to burn up during the re-entry. 
Beijing said on Friday it is unlikely for any large part of the craft to reach the ground.
South Korea's Ministry of Science and ICT said on Sunday it expects the Tiangong-1 to re-enter Earth's atmosphere sometime between 7:26 a.m. and 3:26 p.m. on Monday (2226 GMT to 0626 GMT), according to the Yonhap news agency.
The 10.4-metre-long (34.1-foot) Tiangong-1, or ""Heavenly Palace 1"", was launched in 2011 to carry out docking and orbit experiments as part of China's ambitious space program, which aims to place a permanent station in orbit by 2023. 
The spacelab was originally planned to be decommissioned in 2013 but its mission was repeatedly extended. 
China had said its re-entry into Earth's atmosphere would happen in late 2017 but that process was delayed, leading some experts to suggest the space laboratory is out of control.

In March, China's parliament passed the restructuring plan that merged several ministries and regulators in a bid to streamline the organizational structure and increase the ruling Communist Party's control.
The biggest moves included the merger of the country's banking and insurance regulators and increasing the central bank's financial sector oversight.
Seven new ministries and eight new administrations are under the state council, including a new market regulatory administration with a broad remit ranging from anti-monopoly and pricing supervision to product quality and safety.
China is also consolidating film, news and publishing regulation under the Communist Party's publicity department, signaling tighter media control.

The report said Geingob, currently on a state visit to China, said ""comments smearing bilateral cooperation"" between China and Namibia are ""doomed to fail.""
""We are mature, we can choose our friends, we can choose what we want for, and what's good for us,"" Geingob said.
Africa has been a region of focus for Beijing's quest for greater global influence, with billions of dollars being pumped into infrastructure projects in the continent. Some critics have questioned China's motives, however, accusing it of seeking to secure key raw materials such as oil and minerals. 
In March, then-U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned African countries should be careful not to forfeit their sovereignty when they accept loans from China. He said at that time that if an African government ""gets into trouble"" after accepting a Chinese loan they could lose control of its infrastructure or resources through default.
China has repeatedly rejected accusations that it is only interested in Africa for its mineral resources and said its no-strings-attached aid programs are widely welcomed.
Geingob also told Xinhua that China-Africa cooperation is on equal footing and that China's investment in his country is not just ""digging out resources.""
""No country in the world has added so much value to our products as China has. China has done a lot of technology transfer and job creation,"" the Namibian president told Xinhua.

126,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2018 07:31PM ET</span>",Anxious Hong Kong Catholics told to make leap of faith over China deal,"By Greg Torode and Venus Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - A looming deal between the Vatican and China is causing divisions between the church hierarchy and Catholics in Hong Kong, which has long been a vital beachhead for the faith on the southern edge of officially atheist China. 
Some senior Catholic clergy and Vatican officials have been urging groups of restive Hong Kong brethren in recent weeks to back a deal many fear will betray the so-called ""underground"" mainland Catholics that they have been supporting for years. 
But some in Hong Kong fear any deal on the appointment of bishops in China could be a trap leading to greater persecution of underground believers as they come into the open, and ultimately to tighter Communist Party control of their religion. 
Others, including some whose families fled the communist takeover of China in 1949, are angry the Vatican is prepared to do a deal even when some elderly bishops are in detention and concerns are growing over the party's reach into Hong Kong. 
""Some just cannot believe the Vatican would do this, and it is shaking the foundations of their faith,"" said one missionary priest with more than 20 years experience in parishes on both sides of the border. 
""I fear some will turn away from the Vatican."" 
The 12 million Catholics in China are split between followers of the state's Catholic Patriotic Association, which operates independently of the Pope, and an underground community that swears loyalty to the Vatican. 
Vatican officials say a historic agreement with China's leaders on the appointment of bishops could help avoid further division between the two Catholic groups, even if broader diplomatic issues and human rights concerns remain unresolved. 
Despite mainland reports that a pact is imminent, a Vatican source said on Thursday there is no timeline for a signing. 
'FOLLOW THE LINE' 
The Hong Kong congregation has been told to look at any accord ""with fresh eyes"", to see beyond the politics to consider the long-term importance of building a stronger mainland flock. 
""This isn't about politics, it is about faith,"" said one person familiar with the official message. 
One former Hong Kong bishop, Cardinal Joseph Zen, has campaigned against the deal, saying he fears it is communist manipulation of the church, and has publicly sparred with Vatican officials. Another former bishop, Cardinal Tong Hon, has backed it. 
Zen told Reuters on Thursday that while he was still ""heartbroken"" over what he called the Holy See's ""betrayal"" of Chinese Catholics, the unity of the church should be a priority. 
Those without a strong opinion should ""follow the line"", Zen said. But if some turn away from the Church's leadership, he would not persuade them to change their mind. 
""If they simply give up, it's more prudent (than to fight on). It would do less damage to the Church."" 
'FALLEN INTO A TRAP' 
In one recent meeting, a group of some 30 official and underground clergymen visiting from China joined counterparts in Hong Kong for talks with senior Church officials, according to a Hong Kong cleric with knowledge of the matter. 
During the hour-long discussion, the mainland clergy expressed anxiety, but fell silent after an official, looking resigned, asked what they would do if they were the Pope. 
The cleric, previously critical of the Vatican, now said unity within the Church was the priority. 
""We don't have a deal yet, but the church is already splitting up. The Chinese Communist Party doesn't have to do much and it's already enjoying the results,"" the Hong Kong cleric said.
""We have fallen into a trap."" 
Hong Kong has for decades been one of the most important Catholic cities in Asia, home to an extensive network of aid agencies, missions, scholars and media that have supported Catholics in China and elsewhere. 
Missionary priests who operate underground on the mainland use the city as a base, while other Hong Kong Catholics provide funds and expertise to mainland counterparts. 
Catholics are also prominent across Hong Kong's government and business elites, as well as its democracy groups. 
Hong Kong's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, is a Catholic who is close to the Beijing leadership. She has not yet responded to Reuters' questions about her thoughts on the deal. 
Hong Kong is home to the only Vatican representatives in greater China under Communist Party control, with monsignors operating discreetly out of an art deco villa in the Kowloon suburbs. 
The Holy See Study Mission has no formal diplomatic status, given the Vatican's on-going recognition of Taiwan. But it quietly liaises with both Hong Kong and mainland clergy and missionaries. 
Western diplomats familiar with their work say the exceptionally low-key mission is monitored closely by Chinese security officials. The Study Mission has not responded to requests for comment. 
An Easter editorial in this weekend's Sunday Examiner Catholic paper stressed that ""faith needs courage"". 

""We Christians in Hong Kong are anxious of the prospects of surrendering to the pressures of the atheist government,"" it said.

The Foal Eagle field exercise, which usually involves combined ground, air, naval and special operations troops, will continue for a month. The computer-simulated Key Resolve will be held for two weeks starting in mid-April.
A Pentagon spokesman said in March the two joint drills would involve about 23,700 U.S. troops and 300,000 South Korean forces. Military officials in Seoul have said the scale of the exercises would not go beyond those seen in previous years.
The Foal Eagle and Key Resolve exercises are usually held every year around March but they were postponed this year until after the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and Paralympics, which started in February and ended last month.
North Korea, which has traditionally accused both South Korea and the United States of practising invading the North during joint military drills, has remained quiet on the issue.
In March, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told a visiting South Korean delegation in Pyongyang that he ""understands"" the situation regarding the joint drills, according to South Korea's National Security Office head Chung Eui-yong, who had led the delegation.
The joint exercises come roughly a month ahead of an April 27 summit between the two Koreas, their first in more than a decade.
Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in are widely expected to discuss denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and improvement of inter-Korean relations at the summit.

""The prosecutor's office has issued arrest warrants for five officials of PoliCarabobo who have been signaled as responsible for the tragic incident that led to the death of 68 citizens in the cells of the headquarters of said regional police: THEY HAVE BEEN DETAINED #Justice,"" tweeted prosecutor Tarek Saab. Saab, a former Socialist Party governor close to leftist President Nicolas Maduro, did not provide any further details on the cause of the disaster, the worst to affect Venezuela's notoriously violent jails in over two decades.
Relatives of dead inmates and one surviving prisoner told Reuters there was a shoot-out with police on Wednesday morning in the jail in Carabobo state capital Valencia. 
One inmate's widow said officials had doused the area with gasoline, which fueled a fire through the small cells strung with hammocks and divided with sheets. There was no immediate comment from Carabobo state police.
Venezuela's opposition blames the tragedy on Maduro's inability to reform Venezuela's lawless jails, where inmates strut around with weapons and orchestrate crimes from cells.
""The situation in detention centers and police jail cells in Venezuela is unacceptable!"" said opposition lawmaker Miguel Pizarro.
Opposition politicians have also criticized the government for its long silence about the incident. Maduro's administration only issued a statement late on Friday night expressing its condolences to relatives and the president has yet to publicly speak about the deaths.
A former bus driver and union leader who has grown widely unpopular, Maduro is running for re-election in a May election largely boycotted by the opposition.
With heavy use of state resources and a compliant electoral council, he is expected to win a six-year term despite salary-destroying hyperinflation, a fifth straight year of recession, and rampant crime.
State television focused on showing images of Venezuelans on the beach during the Easter holiday, while Maduro's ministers also largely remained mum on the Valencia disaster.
But Delcy Rodriguez, the president of the pro-government legislative super body known as the constituent assembly, struck back at criticism of the government's handling of the jail fire.

""We repudiate the use of Venezuelans' pain as a political tool,"" tweeted Rodriguez.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Saturday led an Easter vigil service, baptizing eight adults, including a formerly undocumented Nigerian migrant beggar who became a hero when he disarmed an Italian thief wielding a cleaver.
The baptism took place during a long Holy Saturday, or Easter eve, Mass for some 10,000 people in St. Peter's Basilica.
The church, the largest in Christendom, was dark at the start of the service before lights were turned on, signifying the passage from darkness to light when the Bible says Jesus rose from the dead.
The pope traditionally welcomes new members of the Church during the Saturday night service. 
This year, among those he baptized was John Ogah, 31, who Italian newspapers last year dubbed the ""migrant hero"" and held up as an example of bravery and good citizenship. 
Ogah was begging for change outside a supermarket in a Rome neighborhood where many migrants live last September when he stopped a 37-year-old Italian who had just held up the store with a cleaver and was getting away with about 400 euros, according to the Catholic television station TV2000.
The Nigerian, who did not have permission to stay in Italy, held the man down until police arrived and then left the scene, fearing it would be discovered he did not have documents, according to La Repubblica newspaper.
Police using footage from surveillance cameras tracked him down and rewarded him by helping him get legal permission to stay in the country.
An Italian Carabinieri police captain who worked in the neighborhood, Nunzio Carbone, was his godfather, or sponsor, at Saturday's baptism service.
Carbone and his fellow policemen helped Ogah get his immigration papers. The Nigerian now works as a stockman at a warehouse for a charity organization.
The other newly baptized at the service came from Albania, Peru, Italy and the United States.
Francis has made defense of migrants a key part of his papacy.

On Sunday, the pope ends Holy See services by celebrating an Easter Mass and then delivers his twice-yearly ""Urbi et Orbi"" (""to the city and the world"") blessing and message from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica.

A spokeswoman for Baylor, a private Baptist university in Waco, said the money was severance pay, made as part of a legal settlement, and came from institutional reserves.
Kenneth Starr, who was forced to step down as the university's president and chancellor in the wake of the scandal, received more than $4.5 million in severance pay, the school said. Starr rose to prominence in the 1990s for his investigation of Bill Clinton's sex scandals while Clinton was U.S. president.
Starr said in 2016 he was not aware of the assault allegations but accepted responsibility. Both Briles and Baylor have said there were ""serious shortcomings"" in how they responded to the complaints of assault.
The payments, which were first reported by the Dallas Morning News, appear in the university's 990 form, a disclosure document the university must file annually with the Internal Revenue Service as a non-profit organization.
Last year, Baylor reached a settlement with a former student who had sued, saying she was a victim of gang rape by football players, and that the school overlooked a violent culture in order to keep good players on its team.
The U.S. Department of Education is investigating the school's response to students' complaints of sexual assault by football players.
In a statement, Baylor said the payments to the staff it removed were legal settlements, and that it had improved its procedures for reporting sexual assault, among other measures.

""Baylor remains steadfast in our unwavering commitment to care for our students and respond appropriately to incidents of sexual violence,"" the school's statement said.

AMMAN (Reuters) - The Syrian army command said on Saturday it had regained most of the towns and villages in eastern Ghouta and was pressing its military operations in the last rebel bastion of Douma. 
In a televised statement, the Syrian army spokesman said the weeks-long military campaign had now brought security to the Syrian capital, Damascus, and also secured its main links to other parts of the country, stretching north and all the way to the Iraqi border to the east. 
A last group of fighters and families had earlier left the main towns of Jobar, Zamalka, Arbeen and Ain Tarma after the fall of other towns, leaving only the city of Douma still in rebel hands. 
Footage on state television showed top army commanders entering by the same route the rebel convoys had used to leave.
Tens of thousands of people have now evacuated once-bustling towns in the suburbs east of the capital, which had nearly 2 million people before the start of the conflict and were major commercial and industrial hubs.
The army command said military operations were continuing in the outskirts of the city of Douma, controlled by the Jaish al-Islam rebel group, the last patch of eastern Ghouta still held by insurgents. 
Douma's fall would seal the rebels' worst defeat since 2016, driving them from their last big stronghold near the capital, and would also carry potent symbolism. The town was the main center of street protests in the Damascus suburbs against President Bashar al-Assad's rule that ignited the conflict seven years ago. 
The army said hundreds of rebels had been killed in the ferocious offensive. The opposition says a relentless air campaign was waged in which the army used napalm, chlorine and incendiary bombs to demoralize rebels by targeting civilian areas. 
The rebels say the indiscriminate bombing forced them to capitulate and agree to surrender deals that force them either to make peace or leave to rebel-held areas after weeks of bombing and sieges that prevented food from reaching the enclaves.
The Syrian army has repeatedly said regaining control over rebel-held suburbs would stop rocket attacks on the capital.
They deny that many civilians were killed in bombardments that rescuers and residents say reduced whole neighborhoods to rubble in densely populated areas where at least 350,000 people lived.
Defense analysts say a major goal of the campaign was to complete a security belt around the capital, where for years rebels dug into an elaborate network of tunnels and well- fortified positions had resisted countless offensives to seize the enclave. 
President Assad said recently securing eastern Ghouta, which was the soft belly of the heavily defended capital, had foiled plots by his foreign enemies to topple him.
""The gains have been achieved after units of the army eliminated hundreds of terrorists, their headquarter and their fortifications,"" the army statement said.
Douma is surrounded by government forces, many of whom were elite forces from the Republican Guards and special army units, who have been amassing troops in recent days and threatening to storm the city if the rebels do not agree to leave. 
Tens of thousands of civilians remain in Douma, which is the largest urban center in the enclave, facing worsening humanitarian conditions. 
The rebels there deny they are negotiating an evacuation deal and say talks with the Russian military aim to find a solution that would allow them to stay in the city under Moscow's protection.
Negotiators, however, reached a deal with the Russian military late on Saturday to evacuate wounded in the city to insurgent-held areas in northwestern Syria, local sources said.
It was not clear if the step would pave the way towards a broader deal to evacuate fighters in an arrangement similar to one that was brokered by the other main rival rebel group, Failaq al Rahman, with Moscow that has allowed most of its fighters to leave their former areas of control.
The Syrian army offers defeated rebels either the option of making peace and switching sides or surrendering their weapons and leaving for government-controlled areas.
""Army units are continuing their combat operations to rid Douma of terrorists,"" the army statement said.
The Russian-backed offensive in eastern Ghouta has killed more than 1,600 civilians and thousands of wounded, rescuers said. The authorities say about 150,000 people have now been displaced from eastern Ghouta.
Thousands of people -- fighters, their families and other civilians -- have been leaving for northwestern Syria from other parts of eastern Ghouta in convoys of buses that have been given safe passage to Idlib province.
Many evacuees who arrived at rebel-held territory after a grueling trip through government-controlled villages said many residents hurled abuses and threw shoes and stones at their buses.

The conflict began after mass protests calling for an end to Assad's authoritarian rule on March 15 2011, dragging in regional and global powers and forcing millions of people - more than half the pre-war population - to flee their homes.

DHARAMSALA, INDIA (Reuters) - The Dalai Lama called on his people to remain united as the Tibetan community gathered on Saturday in a small hill town to mark 60 years of political asylum in India - although just one federal minister appeared at the event.
The ""Thank You India"" event had been scheduled for India's capital, New Delhi, but was shifted to Dharamsala, a small town in the country's north where Tibetans run a government in exile, as India tries to avoid a confrontation with China, which views the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist.
Officially, New Delhi says its policy toward the Dalai Lama remains the same, and the Tibetan government in exile says it moved the event to Dharamsala out of respect for India's foreign policy needs. India's culture minister was the only minister present at the event.
""Today we are celebrating 60 years in exile and we are confident, and we can see how our future shapes up,"" the Dalai Lama said at the event.
He emphasized the ""strong bond between India and Tibet"", saying the two shared a ""deep connection of culture and literature"".
China took control of Tibet in 1950 in what it called a ""peaceful liberation"". In March 1959, the Dalai Lama, then 23 years old, fled to India along with his followers. 
Then-Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru welcomed the monk and allowed him to make Dharamsala his seat. But the ties have weakened as India tries to improve relations with China and avoid a standoff such as a 73-day military face-off along a stretch of their disputed border last year.
""From Nehru to Modi, we have followed a one-China policy,"" Ram Madhav, the general secretary of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party said. The links between India and Tibet were ""very little political but more spiritual, religious and cultural,"" he added.
Earlier this month, India issued an unprecedented ban on Tibetans holding a rally with the Dalai Lama in New Delhi to mark the 60th anniversary of the start of a failed uprising against Chinese rule.
The Dalai Lama also canceled a visit to the Indian border state of Sikkim this week, hosted by authorities there, officials say, lest it offended China.
That is in contrast to the Dalai Lama's free movement within India, including the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims as its own.
Lobsang Sangay, the head of the Tibetan government in exile, was critical of China's Tibet policy at Saturday's event.

""It's been 60 years since China's illegal invasion and occupation of Tibet, 60 years of destruction of Tibetan civilization, Tibetan culture and Tibetan identity,"" Sangay said, thanking India for its support.

The episode angered many politicians, some of whom saw it as a violation of Italian territory.
The ministry, which had earlier summoned the French ambassador for an explanation, said in a statement that it had conveyed the Rome government's ""firm protest for the behavior of the French customs agents, which was unacceptable ...""
The NGO, Rainbow for Africa, said that on Friday evening the French brought a Nigerian migrant to the railway station of the Italian border town of Bardonecchia.
The NGO said they entered the clinic, which is in the train station, and conducted a urine test on the man because they suspected him of drug trafficking.
The foreign ministry said France had been told earlier this month that the station was no longer accessible for its police because it was now being used for humanitarian purposes.
In their account of the incident, French customs said they had the written consent of the man for the test and the NGO had also given them permission to use the facilities for it. The test was negative.
French customs said they had followed regulations and were ready to clarify with the Italians any legal and operational procedures to avoid future incidents. 
Massimiliano Fedriga of the right-wing League, which made big gains in recent elections, said the French had made Italy look like the laughing stock of Europe.
""French police do whatever they want on Italian territory without being disturbed, as if they are at home. What happened in Bardonecchia is grave and shows how our so-called friends in Europe have little or no consideration for us,"" he said in a statement.

The latest draw marks only the fourth time the jackpot has surpassed the half-billion-dollar mark in the game's history, the Mega Millions lottery said.
The winning numbers drawn on Friday night were 11, 28, 31, 46, and 59 with a ""mega Ball"" of 1. They appear on a single ticket sold at a Lukoil gas station in Riverdale, New Jersey, the New Jersey Lottery said on Twitter.
The drawing follows a March 27 Mega Millions drawing that was the twenty-third in a row without a jackpot-winning ticket. 
The grand prize has rolled higher since it was last won on Jan. 5 at $451 million by a 20-year-old Florida man, the lottery said. 
Friday's 11 pm ET jackpot drawing was for the tenth largest prize ever offered in the United States. Powerball holds the record with a $1.586 billion payout in 2016. 
The Mega Millions record is $656 million won in 2012.

138,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2018 10:41AM ET</span>","At rhino's memorial, Kenyan minister urges life sentences for ivory possession","NANYUKI, Kenya (Reuters) - The death of the world's last male northern white rhinoceros this month led a Kenyan government official to declare anyone caught possessing ivory should be sentenced to life in prison.
""Ivory belongs to elephants and rhinos,"" said Najib Balala, Kenya's tourism minister, during a memorial service held at Ol Pejeta Conservancy on Saturday for Sudan, the 45-year-old rhino, who died 11 days ago.
Wildlife officials at Ol Pejeta, about 250 kilometers (155 miles) north of Nairobi, put down the rhino on March 19 because of rapid deterioration in his health.
Sudan is survived by the last two females of his species, his 27-year-old daughter Najin and 17-year-old granddaughter Fatu. The only hope for preserving their species is through in vitro fertilization using their eggs and stored semen, according to Ol Pejeta.
Thousand of southern white rhinos still roam sub-Saharan Africa, but decades of rampant poaching have drastically cut the number of northern whites. Poachers could sell northern white rhino horns for $50,000 per kilo, making them more valuable than gold.
Kenya had 20,000 rhinos in the 1970s, falling to 400 in the 1990s. It now has 650, almost all of them black rhinos.
""We are going to change our laws so that anyone caught with ivory will be jailed for life,"" Balala said.
Kenya introduced tough wildlife-protection laws in 2013 in an attempt to stop highly lucrative ivory smuggling, mainly to Asia, which has led to the slaughter of thousands of rare and endangered animals.
Those found guilty of ivory trafficking already face a life sentence. But the minimum sentence for possessing it is just five years. 
After a court sentenced a Kenyan man to 20 years in jail for possessing ivory, the top prosecutor sought for the punishment to be changed to a life sentenced. The convicted man's appeal is still in the courts.
The slaughter of endangered animals in Africa for profit continues, but there is ever greater awareness of the bloody cost of ivory, and more international action to stop the trade.

In a move with major implications for the illegal wildlife trade from Africa, China banned ivory sales in December. The country is the world's largest importer and end user of elephant tusks.

Hawking, crippled since a young man by a degenerative disease, beat the odds stacked against him to became the most celebrated scientist of his era. His work ranged from the origins of the universe itself, through time travel and probing black holes in space. 
He achieved international renown after the publication of ""A Brief History of Time"" in 1988.
His coffin was topped with white ""Universe"" lilies and white ""Polar Star"" roses and carried by pallbearers from the University of Cambridge, where he worked. It was greeted by a large crowd outside the church who clapped as it was carried in. 
The 76-year-old scientist was mourned by his children Robert, Lucy and Timothy, joined by guests including playwright Alan Bennett, businessman Elon Musk and model Lily Cole. 
Eddie Redmayne, the actor who played Professor Hawking in the 2014 film ""The Theory of Everything"" was one of the readers in the ceremony and Felicity Jones, who played his wife, Jane Hawking in the film also attended the service. 
The ceremony included space-themed music composed specially for Hawking called ""Beyond the Night Sky"", inspired by a poem and quotes from ""A Brief History of Time"" and whistling and ""shh"" sounds based on recordings of space.
Astronomer Royal Martin Rees, a personal friend, read from Plato's Apology 40, ""The Death of Socrates"", which talks of the search for knowledge persisting after death. 
Confined to a wheelchair for most of his life after being diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease when he was 21, Hawking's towering intellect and sheer persistence struck a chord with ordinary people, Rees said in an appreciation published earlier this month.
""Why did he become such a 'cult figure'? The concept of an imprisoned mind roaming the cosmos plainly grabbed people's imagination,"" he said.
""His name will live in the annals of science; millions have had their cosmic horizons widened by his best-selling books; and even more, around the world, have been inspired by a unique example of achievement against all the odds – a manifestation of amazing will-power and determination.""

Hawking's ashes will be interred at Westminster Abbey in June, among some of the greatest scientists in history, Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin.

140,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>",Syrian mother hopes to reunite family shattered by war,"DAMASCUS (Reuters) - Amira Gharmoush's family has been a victim of both sides of the war for the eastern Ghouta region near Damascus. The 67-year-old Syrian mother of nine is now hoping to piece back together what's left of it.
She fled eastern Ghouta four years ago when, she said, one of her three daughters was killed by insurgents in the area, the last major rebel stronghold near Damascus until the Syrian government launched a ferocious campaign to recapture it.
Two her six sons accompanied her on her journey out of eastern Ghouta at the time. They were detained by the Syrian government and she has not heard from them since.
The other four sons stayed inside eastern Ghouta, separated from their mother by the frontlines of a war that has broken up countless families and killed hundreds of thousands of people over the last seven years.
As the frontlines shifted in recent weeks, Gharmoush was reunited with two more of her sons. They fled eastern Ghouta two weeks ago as the government offensive pushed closer to their homes, uprooting them and many thousands more.
Backed by Russia, the assault has underlined President Bashar al-Assad's unassailable position in the war. 
TEARS, HOPE
Gharmoush spoke at a Syrian government supervised shelter for displaced people, where she was visiting the sons who left Ghouta recently. She expressed hope that she would soon see the two sons who remain in the area. 
Both are in Douma, the last town under rebel control. ""It's been four years since I've seen them,"" she said, her eyes full of tears. 
""My hope is that my sons who are in Ghouta get out, and that the ones who are detainees get out, and to bring my children together so we all live together,"" said Gharmoush. 
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says more than 1,600 civilians have been killed in the government bombardment of the area, which has been besieged for years. 
More than 140,000 people have been displaced from eastern Ghouta since the offensive got underway in February, according to figures cited by the Russian military and the Observatory. 
The Russian defense ministry said on Friday around 32,000 rebel fighters and members of their families had so far been transported to opposition-held areas in the Idlib region of northwestern Syria, Interfax reported.
Many of those who have not gone to Idlib are in shelters for the displaced near Damascus. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Aid has said the displaced are not permitted to leave the shelters until they have undergone a screening process. 
Gharmoush sat next to her seven-year-old granddaughter - the child of the daughter who was killed four years ago, who she has cared for ever since. 
Gharmoush says her daughter was killed for delivering bread to government troops stationed at a checkpoint near their village, Otaya.
She did not say which rebel group the killers belonged to. Reuters could not verify the account.
Gharmoush, who has been working as a household servant in the capital since fleeing her farm, says she dreams of going back to her home in Otaya, where they kept sheep and cows.

""I would be the first one to return. If my home is destroyed I will put up a tent like the one I am in now and stay there. I will gather my children and we will stay together.""

The report says that so far, it has not been possible to build an encryption device for secure data transfer into the jet, which entered service in the 1970s.
The communication devices of the Tornado also do not meet current standards, the report said, meaning there's a risk that information could be intercepted. 
""This could in the worst case mean that the demand for an encrypted communication system for the Tornado weapons system can't be achieved. That means the Tornado weapons system may not take part in NATO missions,"" the report states. 
A spokesman for the German air force said its 10 Tornado jets registered for the NATO Response Force met current requirements, without providing further details. 
The report was first cited by German magazine Spiegel. 
Germany wants to start phasing out the Tornado jets in 2025 and the defense ministry has said that the Eurofighter Typhoon is the leading candidate, with Lockheed Martin's F-35 and Boeing's F-15 and F-18 fighters also options.

An annual report released in February said Germany's military must move faster to tackle persistent gaps in personnel and equipment.

They told Reuters that, as of 1100 GMT, fire trucks had not been able to put out the blaze in the warehousing area, which they said appeared to have been caused by an electrical short circuit.
Reuters television footage showed thick plumes of smoke rising into the air and fire fighters dousing flames.
Hodeidah port, on the Red Sea, handles the bulk of Yemen's imports, including critically-needed food and aid supplies. The three-year war in the country, which was already the Arab world's poorest, has pushed it to the verge of famine.
""The fire destroyed huge amounts of fuel and humanitarian aid and foodstuff,"" a U.N. World Food Programme (WFP) employee told Reuters by telephone, adding that there would be an investigation to determine the cause.
The Houthi-run Saba news agency reported the fire at the port, but did not mention the cause.
Workers said the warehouses also contained hundreds of thousands of mattresses meant for those displaced by the war, which has killed more than 10,000 people and crippled the economy. The United Nations says that three out of four Yemenis - 22 million civilians - need relief aid. 
A Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognized Yemeni government that was forced into exile by the Iran-aligned Houthis. 
Late year the coalition, under international pressure, eased a three-week blockade imposed on Yemeni ports and airports in November in response to a ballistic missile fired by the Houthis toward the Saudi capital, Riyadh.

Mokgweetsi Masisi becomes only the third leader to take charge of the southern African nation outside the Khama political dynasty that has dominated national politics since independence from Britain in 1966.
Masisi, 55, inherits a country that has for decades been heralded as a beacon of African democracy and sound economic management but faces a huge task of reducing the country's dependence on diamonds. 
""I am not sure about his competency in as far as the economy is concerned, but if he has the respect of his ministers then he should be able to make them deliver,"" said political analyst Ndulamo Anthony Morima. 
Masisi, a trained teacher who has also worked for the United Nations Children's Fund as an education project officer for eight years until 2003, was elected lawmaker in 2009. He served in the president's office as a minister of public affairs from 2011 until 2014 when Khama named him minister of education, a post he held until appointed vice president last year. 
""The business community sees him as being more business-friendly so that should work well for the economy. He seems to be more likely to come up with regulation that enables more economic activity,"" said RMB Botswana economist Moatlhodi Sebabole. 
Masisi takes office more than a year before the election under Botswana's constitution that restricts the president to serving two five-year terms. Khama, son the son of Botswana's first president, Seretse, also took over from Festus Mogae a year before the 2009 election.
One of the world's poorest countries in the 1970s, Botswana transformed itself into one of the fastest-growing economies by harnessing around $3 billion a year in diamond sales, to become one of the world's biggest producers, and gained middle-income status. 
But dependence on its wealth from the diamond industry might be catching up with the landlocked country of just two million after the collapse in commodity prices in 2014 tipped its economy into recession three years ago.
""He is well versed with current challenges that the country is facing and I am sure he is quite capable of delivering,"" said Mothusi Sename, a 41-year-old taxi driver in Gaborone, referring to Masisi. 
END OF POLITICAL DYNASTY?
Khama's departure leaves his younger brother and tourism minister Tshekedi as the only member of the family holding a high-profile post in the government, and depending on who Masisi picks as vice president, it would be the first time a Khama is not part of the top tier of national leadership. 
Khama, a 65-year old bachelor, is known as a straight talker having publicly criticized leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump for an alleged slur against African countries and then-president Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe for overstaying his welcome.
Khama was born in Britain after his father a married a white British woman Ruth Williams, defying convention and opposition in Africa and Britain. Their story was depicted in the 2016 film 'A United Kingdom'.
His party, Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), is expected to name Masisi as its presidential candidate for next year's election.

Masisi will be inaugurated on Sunday.

FREETOWN (Reuters) - Sierra Leone voted on Saturday in a poll delayed by fraud allegations to choose a successor to President Ernest Bai Koroma who leaves a country still struggling after the Ebola epidemic. 
The face-off between opposition leader Julius Maada Bio and ruling party standard-bearer Samura Kamara was supposed to take place on Tuesday but was rescheduled after a complaint about fraud in the first round of voting this month from a member of Kamara's All People's Congress. 
The successor to Koroma, who is stepping aside after his maximum two five-year terms in office, faces an uphill struggle to overturn years of hardship caused by a slump in the price of its commodity exports and Ebola.
Voting got under way early in peaceful conditions, according to witnesses, though some complained that a heavy police presence inside polling stations was deterring people from casting their ballot. 
Staff at two polling stations said turnout in the morning was lower than in the first round. Many were forced to walk to their nearest voting station because of a driving ban imposed on election day for security reasons. 
""There is low turnout in different parts of the country because of the huge presence of security forces,"" Julius Maada Bio said after voting in Freetown.
President Koroma also noted the low turnout when he spoke in Freetown, and urged people to head to their polling stations.
Concern about policing comes after the National Electoral Commission last week said that police had tried to intimidate staff in the run-up to the election.
Speaking to the media, army spokesman Major Paow Kagbo said the military personnel were there to ensure the election was ""free and fair"". 
Politics in the West African country of over seven million people has been dominated by two parties since independence from Britain in 1961: the ruling All People's Congress, now fielding ex-foreign minister Samura Kamara, and the Sierra Leone People's Party behind Julius Maada Bio, who briefly ruled as head of a military junta in 1996.
The first round of voting was marred by allegations of fraud in some districts. In some districts, police fired tear gas to disperse crowds after a dispute over voting irregularities.
But the generally peaceful nature of the election, and the fact Koroma is stepping down while some other African presidents seek to extend their mandates, is seen as a positive sign for Sierra Leone that was ripped apart by a 1990s civil war. 
The Ebola crisis in 2014 and 2015 and the global commodities downturn slowed the economy, which shrank by a fifth in 2015.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo authorities have launched an investigation into the arrest and extradition of six Turkish citizens, which activists said represented a violation of human rights, Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj said on Saturday. 
The six Turkish nationals were arrested in Kosovo on Thursday, at Turkey's request, over alleged links to schools financed by the Gulen movement, which Ankara blames for a failed 2016 coup.
On Friday Haradinaj sacked the Kosovo interior minister and secret service chief for failing to inform him about the arrests. 
""Today we have decided to start an investigation of all (state) structures that were involved in arresting and deporting the six Turkish men,"" Haradinaj said on Saturday after an urgent meeting of Kosovo's security council. 
Ankara accused the six arrested men of being recruiters for a network run by the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, and said they had helped people accused of connections to the network to leave Turkey. Ankara blames Gulen and his movement for the coup attempt in 2016. Gulen denies involvement.
Human Rights Watch criticized the Kosovo authorities over the arrests. 
""In addition to the questionable arrests, the men were sent to a country where they face a serious risk of torture,"" the watchdog said in a statement. 
Kosovo has been under pressure from Turkey in recent weeks to take action against schools funded by the Gulen organization.
Family members of the six had stayed at Pristina airport until the early hours of Saturday after rumors spread that they might still be in Kosovo.
They left after the police said the six had been sent to Turkey on Thursday. 
""My father was kidnapped,"" said one family member, Mustafa Gunakan, outside the airport. ""We thought we were safe in Kosovo. We never thought it would end this way.""
Florian Bieber, a Balkans expert at the University of Graz, said the incident could be damaging for Kosovo, which is seeking to build closer ties with the European Union. 

""It certainly will hurt Kosovo, both for throwing doubt on the rule of law and political authority and for cooperation with a regime that is authoritarian and increasingly antagonistic with the EU,"" Bieber told Reuters.

In the southern Gaza Strip, residents said Israeli troops fired warning shots toward a crowd of youths, some of whom burned tyres. Health officials said two people were wounded and an Israeli military spokesman said he was checking the details.
On Friday, at least 15 Palestinians were killed by Israeli security forces confronting protesters, some of whom the military said had opened fire, rolled burning tyres and hurled rocks and fire bombs toward troops across the border.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared Saturday a national day of mourning and a general strike was called across the occupied West Bank. Thousands in Gaza marched through the streets at funerals for those killed. 
Tens of thousands of Palestinians had gathered on Friday along the fenced 65-km (40-mile) frontier, where tents were erected for a planned six-week protest pressing for a right of return for refugees and their descendents to what is now Israel. The Israeli military estimate was 30,000.
Families brought their children to the encampments just a few hundred metres (yards) from the Israeli security barrier with the Islamist Hamas-run enclave. Football pitches were marked out in the sand and scout bands played.
But as Friday wore on, hundreds of Palestinian youths ignored calls from the organizers and the Israeli military to stay away from the frontier, where Israeli soldiers on the other side kept watch from dirt mound embankments, and violence broke out.
PALESTINIANS MARKING ""CATASTROPHE"" 
The protest, organized by Hamas and other Palestinian factions, is scheduled to culminate on May 15, the day Palestinians commemorate what they call the ""Nakba"" or ""Catastrophe"" when hundreds of thousands fled or were driven out of their homes in 1948, when the state of Israel was created.
Israel has long ruled out any right of return, fearing an influx of Arabs that would wipe out its Jewish majority. It argues that refugees should resettle in a future state the Palestinians seek in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. Peace talks to that end have been frozen since 2014.
Abbas's spokesman, Nabil Abu Rdainah, said: ""The message of the Palestinian people is clear. The Palestinian land will always belong to its legitimate owners and the occupation will be removed."" 
Israeli military spokesman Brigadier-General Ronen Manelis said Hamas was using the protests as a guise to launch attacks against Israel and ignite the area. He said violence would likely continue along the border until May 15. 
""We won't let this turn into a ping-pong zone where they perpetrate a terrorist act and we respond with pinpoint action. If this continues we will not have no choice but to respond inside the Gaza Strip,"" Manelis told reporters in a phone briefing.

The Gaza Health Ministry had said on Friday 16 people were killed but revised the death toll to 15 on Saturday.

ULAANBAATAR (Reuters) - Thousands of Mongolians protested in front of parliament in Ulaanbaatar on Saturday to demand more action to prevent child abuse, after the widely-reported rape of a male infant shocked the country.
After the reported rape earlier this month in Dornogobi province in Mongolia's southeast, a group of concerned mothers created a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group announcing the Saturday protest last week, and it quickly reached more than 400,000 members. 
""We want to show child abusers that we are strong in order to protect our children,"" said Davaa Baatar, 41, the father of three children who was attending the protest. 
The protesters held placards with messages such as ""Stop child abuse"", ""No child rape"" and ""Our children, our future"".
The protest organizers are demanding stricter laws regarding child abuse, better government services for survivors and more public awareness.
""We will give our policy demands to the parliament, government and the president's office on Monday,"" said Odontuya Tsolmon, one of the protest organizers.
The government has promised a response.
""As soon as we get the proposed demands from organizers, the cabinet will be open to discuss it,"" a government spokesman told Reuters, adding that the prime minister's advisors were at the demonstration.
Some group members have advocated for the death penalty for sex offenders, though the protest organizers said they were opposed to capital punishment. 
President Khaltmaa Battulga formed a commission to reinstate capital punishment for such crimes last year after similar widely-publicised incidents of child sexual assaults provoked a public outcry. 
According to the state prosecutors office, there were 298 reported incidents of child rape in 2015 and 2016. Experts believe this is a small proportion of actual incidents of child sexual abuse due to a pervasive cultural stigma over the topic. 
""The fear of being blamed and shamed means victims and their families keep quiet and don't report to the police,"" Ganbayasgakh Geleg, a founder of the Gender Equality Centre which fights human trafficking and sexual violence, told Reuters.
Mongolia, a thinly populated and mineral-rich country of just three million people sandwiched between Russia and China, transitioned to a parliamentary democracy in 1990 having previously been a satellite of the Soviet Union. 
But there has been continued public frustration about the economy, corruption and air pollution, among other issues. 

Last year, a slump in foreign investment and declining commodity prices forced Mongolia to agree to a $5.5 billion bailout led by the International Monetary Fund to relieve fiscal strains and try to restore investor confidence.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Moscow has told Britain it must cut ""just over 50"" more of its diplomatic and technical staff in Russia in a worsening standoff over the poisoning of a Russian former spy and his daughter in England, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Saturday.
Separately, Moscow also demanded an official explanation for the search of a Russian passenger plane in London on Thursday and said it could reserve the right to take similar action against British airlines in Russia. 
More than 100 Russian diplomats have been expelled by various countries, including 23 from Britain itself, to punish the Kremlin over the March 4 attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the historic English city of Salisbury. 
London says Moscow was responsible for poisoning the Skripals in the first known use of a military-grade nerve agent on European soil since World War Two. Russia flatly denies that and has cast the allegations as part of an elaborate Western plot to sabotage East-West relations and isolate Moscow.
Russia had already retaliated in kind by ejecting 23 British diplomats. On Friday, the Foreign Ministry summoned British Ambassador Laurie Bristow and told him London had one month to further cut its diplomatic contingent in Russia to the same size as the Russian mission in Britain. It also expelled 59 diplomats from 23 other countries for backing Britain. 
A spokeswoman for Britain's foreign ministry called the Russian move regrettable, and said it was considering the implications of the measures. It did not say how many diplomatic staff in Russia would be affected, while the British Embassy in Moscow says it does not make staff numbers public. 
Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Reuters the demand meant Britain would have to cut ""a little over 50"" more of its diplomatic and technical staff in Russia on top of the 23 diplomats who have already gone home. 
""We asked for parity. The Brits have 50 diplomats more than the Russians,"" Zakharova said on Saturday.
When asked if that meant London would now have to cut exactly 50 diplomatic and technical staff, she said: ""A little over 50.""
Russia's Ministry of Transport meanwhile demanded Britain explain why the Aeroflot (MM:AFLT) passenger plane was searched at Heathrow airport on Friday, in what the Russian Embassy in London called a ""blatant provocation"".
Britain said the search was a normal security measure.
""It is routine for (Britain's border agency) to search aircraft to protect the UK from organized crime and from those who attempt to bring harmful substances like drugs or firearms into the country,"" Security Minister Ben Wallace said in a written statement.
""Once these checks were carried out, the plane was allowed to carry on with its onward journey.""
VISITS?
Britain's foreign office also said on Saturday it was considering allowing visits under consular access terms to Yulia Skripal, who is recovering in hospital against all expectations and no longer in critical condition.
Russia's embassy said that it had contacted Viktoria Skripal, Yulia's cousin. ""Upon receiving confirmation that Yulia Skripal's condition is getting better and she is able to communicate, she said she would like to go to London and to visit her cousin,"" the embassy said.
The BBC, citing sources, reported on Friday that Yulia was ""conscious and talking,"" a factor which may influence the investigation of how she and her father were poisoned.
Britain must now decide how it wants to make the cuts to its Russian diplomatic team and may be forced to lay off some Russian support staff as well as sending home fully-fledged diplomats to satisfy Moscow's demand. 
Russia ordered the closure of another British consulate, in St Petersburg, earlier this month in its first retaliatory step.

The poisoning on UK territory has united much of the West in taking action against what it regards as the hostile policies of President Vladimir Putin. This includes the United States under President Donald Trump, who Putin had hoped would improve ties.

In a statement carried by state news agency SPA the coalition said that according to initial findings an Indian resident was injured by falling debris after the missile was intercepted.
The Houthi-run Saba news agency earlier said a missile was fired at a Saudi National Guard base in Najran, and that it had led to ""losses in the ranks of the enemy and its military equipment"".
The Iran-aligned Houthis have launched scores of missiles at the kingdom since the coalition intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 after the Houthis drove Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile. 
Last week, Saudi air defense forces intercepted a flurry of missiles, and falling debris caused the first death in the capital Riyadh. 
Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of supplying missile parts and expertise to the Houthis, who have taken over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and other parts of the country. Tehran and the Houthis deny the charge.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - About 200 demonstrators squared off with police in riot gear overnight in California's capital and more protests were planned for Saturday after an autopsy on Stephon Clark contradicted the police account of the shooting of the unarmed black man by officers. 
Waving signs and chanting Clark's name in unison, the protesters gathered at city hall before marching into the Old Sacramento part of the city, filled with bars, restaurants and tourists.
Protesters, some with megaphones and black masks covering their faces, shouted ""Shoot us down, we shut you down"", along with expletives directed at the police.
More than 80 police and California Highway Patrol officers in riot gear blocked protesters from marching onto a highway. There were no arrests, the Sacramento Bee reported.
Clark's death two weeks ago was the most recent in a string of fatal shootings of black men by police that have triggered protests across the United States and fueled a national debate about bias in the American criminal justice system.
Clark, a 22-year-old father of two, was gunned down in the backyard of his grandparents' house by police responding to a report that someone was breaking windows. Police said the officers who shot at Clark 20 times feared he was holding a gun, but that he was later found to have been holding a cellphone.
Police have said he was moving toward officers in a menacing way when they fired. The incident was captured on a body cam video released by police on Wednesday.
The latest demonstrations were touched off by a new private autopsy on Clark that showed that none of the eight bullets that hit him struck him in the front, contradicting the police version of events, a lawyer for the deceased's family said on Friday.
Clark was shot six times in the back, once in the side and once in the leg, the autopsy found.
Dr. Bennet Omalu, the forensic pathologist who conducted the independent autopsy, said at a briefing that any one of seven bullets that entered the upper half of Clark's body could have killed him.
Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Clark's family, said: ""This independent autopsy affirms that Stephon was not a threat to police and was slain in another senseless police killing under increasingly questionable circumstances."" 
The Sacramento Police Department said it would have no further comment on the case until after the release of the findings of an official autopsy by the county coroner, and a review by state and local prosecutors. 
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra has said state investigators will oversee the investigation and review the police department's procedures and practices.
On several occasions since Clark was killed, protesters have marched, held demonstrations and twice blocked fans from reaching games played by the Sacramento Kings NBA basketball team at the Golden 1 Center. 

Another protest is planned for noon on Saturday and is to be led by retired Sacramento Kings basketball star Matt Barnes, a statement from the organizers of the Unity and Action rally said.

152,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2018 02:50AM ET</span>",China to spend $300 million on improved irrigation in southern Xinjiang,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The Chinese government will spend 1.875 billion yuan ($298.92 million) to improve irrigation systems in the heavily ethnic Uighur southern part of the violence-prone far western region of Xinjiang, state news agency Xinhua said on Saturday.
The government has increasingly turned its focus to development in southern Xinjiang in recent years, in an implicit recognition of the economic causes of some of the unrest there.
Xinjiang, a huge region bordering Central Asia, has long been a security worry for Beijing, which has led a massive clamp down after deadly bouts of ethnic violence it blames on Islamist and separatist extremists amongst the Uighur population.
Xinhua said the funds will be used to upgrade irrigation facilities and promote water-saving technology to boost farm output in southern Xinjiang, where it said most the region's poorest people live.
Southern Xinjiang is a major producer of cotton and fruit.
""However, a lack of water and outdated irrigation systems have long hampered agricultural development in the region,"" Xinhua said. It did not provide a timeframe for the investment.
Aksu, Kashgar and Hotan in southern Xinjiang are among the poorest parts of China, with more than 1.6 million people living below the poverty line as of the end of 2017, the report added.
These three areas have also been at the epicenter of what China terms its war on terror, with hundreds having died in violence over the past few years.
The Uighurs are a mostly Muslim people who speak a Turkic language.
Rights groups and exiled Uighurs say repressive Chinese government policies are more to blame for the unrest than any organized Islamist or separatist groups. China denies any repression in Xinjiang.
But recognizing the economic roots of some of the violence and frustration of many young Uighurs at missing out on China's economic boom, Beijing has increased its focus on southern Xinjiang, pumping in money and encouraging development.

""An unmanned Israeli spy plane crashes between the villages of Beit Yahoun and Baraachit,"" al-Manar reported. 
A statement from the Israeli military said the drone had crashed because of a technical malfunction. ""The incident is currently being reviewed. There is no risk of leaked information,” the statement said.
Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah last fought a war in 2006. Israeli and U.S. officials say Iran is helping the group build factories to manufacture precision-guided missiles or refit its longer-range missiles with precision guidance systems. 
The heavily armed Hezbollah joined the Syrian civil war in support of Assad in 2012, and has played a critical part in helping his government defeat Sunni rebels backed by the United States and its regional allies - Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey.
Hezbollah has spearheaded a coalition of Tehran-backed Shi'ite militias that have deployed to Syria from Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Iran's expanding power in Syria has caused deep alarm in neighboring Israel.
Israel has mounted numerous air strikes in Syria against what it has described as Hezbollah and Iranian targets.
Sheikh Naim Qassem, the deputy leader of the Iran-backed Shi’ite group, told Reuters in an interview on March 15 that Hezbollah does not expect Israel to launch a war for now in Lebanon but that it is prepared for one.

MINGORA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai visited her birthplace in Pakistan's Swat Valley on Saturday, bursting into tears as she entered her childhood home for the first time since a Taliban gunman shot her in 2012.
The 20-year-old told a family friend she planned to return home after completing her education at Oxford, where she is reading for a degree in politics, philosophy and economics.
Roads were blocked off in the town of Mingora as Yousafzai, known universally by her first name, flew in by military helicopter with her parents and brother.
Security was tight around her former home, now rented by a family friend, Farid-ul-Haq Haqqani, who has kept the young woman's room intact with her books, school trophies and luggage.
""They were weeping. They were kneeling on the ground. They were touching the mud with their eyes,” Haqqani said of Malala and her family. He agreed to be interviewed inside the family home and pointed out a shelf in her room with books including Shakespeare's ""Comedy of Errors"" and ""Romeo and Juliet"" as well as a copy of the television series ""Ugly Betty"".
""I asked her when are you permanently coming back and she said 'God willing, when my education is completed, I will God willing come back to Pakistan.'""
He added that Malala chatted in her room with four friends from her school days in Swat, while her parents greeted neighbors who dropped by - since the security detail would not allow her to go to other houses or even up on the roof of her home.
Malala has been visiting Pakistan since Thursday, her first trip home since she was shot and airlifted abroad for treatment. The government and military have been providing security.
It had been uncertain whether she would be able to visit Swat, a scenic mountain region parts of which spent nearly two years under the control of Pakistani Taliban militants and their harsh interpretation of Islamic law, due to continued concerns for her safety.
""I miss everything about Pakistan ... from the rivers, the mountains, to even the dirty streets and the garbage around our house, and my friends and how we used to have gossip ...to how we used to fight with our neighbors,"" Malala told Reuters in an interview on Friday.
""I had never been so excited for anything. I've never been so happy before,"" she said of returning to Pakistan.
""WEAPON OF EDUCATION""
Two security officials told Reuters the trip to Swat would likely be just for one day.
Another family friend, Jawad Iqbal Yousafzai, who is from the same Pashtun clan as Malala, said the family also visited a local army cadet college.
The Pakistani army wrested control of Swat back from the Taliban in 2009 and the area remains mostly peaceful, but the militants still occasionally launch attacks, including one on the military a few weeks ago.
The Taliban claimed responsibility in 2012 for the attack on Yousafzai for her outspoken advocacy for girls' education, which was forbidden under the militants' rule over Swat.
She wrote an anonymous blog for the BBC Urdu service as a schoolgirl during the Taliban rule and later became outspoken in advocating more educational opportunities for girls.
In 2014, Malala became the youngest Nobel laureate, honored for her work with the Malala Foundation, a charity she set up to support education advocacy groups with a focus on Pakistan, Nigeria, Jordan, Syria and Kenya.
This month, a new girls' school built with her Nobel prize money opened in the village of Shangla in Swat Valley.
""The people of Swat and the whole of Pakistan are with Malala,"" Jawad Iqbal Yousafzai said.
""God willing, we will counter the terrorism and extremism in our region with the weapon of education, with the weapon of a pen, with the weapons of teachers and with the weapons of books.""
Haqqani said Malala and her brother requested to be sent dried plums from a tree in the garden once they were harvested.
The family visit lasted about 90 minutes, he said.

""They were leaving the house slowly. They were dragging their feet. They were coming back inside again and again,"" he said.

ACAPULCO (Reuters) - Dozens of Roman Catholic devotees dressed as ancient Romans and biblical figures fled a Good Friday procession in panic on Friday in the Mexican resort town of Acapulco after gunfire rang out over a nearby car robbery. 
One of the robbers died from a heart attack during a shootout with police while an accomplice escaped, said the government of Guerrero, one of Mexico's most violent states.
Minutes after the confrontation, another man in a home nearby was killed in what was reported to police as a subsequent slew of gunfire. No people in the procession were reported injured.
Murder rates in Acapulco and the popular Los Cabos resort further north have soared in recent years as Mexico fights entrenched drug crime. 
Mexico registered a record number of murders last year, staining the reputation of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) whose presidential candidate, Jose Antonio Meade, trails third in polls to win the July 1 election. 
Campaigns officially kicked off on Friday, with the second- and fourth-place contenders holding midnight rallies to deliver vows to curb corruption and violence, two of Mexico's most critical and intertwined issues that are shaping the race.
Meade and leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who ranks first in polls, will launch their campaigns on Sunday.
In Acapulco on Friday, a video verified by Reuters shows onlookers who had just concluded the re-enactment of Jesus Christ's crucifixion darting in terror down a major street, yelling, ""Stay calm, stay calm!"" 
One man crouched behind a large wooden crucifix propped against a parked car, while a group of men in flowing red capes and Romanesque armor streamed past. Women grabbed hands with children, pushing them through the confused mob. 
A shootout also interrupted a Good Friday procession in the violent northern city of Reynosa and left one dead, local media reported.
According to a video aired on television, several dozen religious marchers darted to the sidewalk amid shouts of ""Get to the ground!"" after the pop-pop of gunfire cut into choral singing.

A Jesus figure wearing white robes tinged with fake blood kneeled behind a giant crucifix as more gunfire rang out, dropping it when a companion yelled for him to ""leave the cross!"" and take cover off the street.

157,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2018 10:11PM ET</span>","Venezuela government breaks silence over jail riot, fire that killed 68","CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s government broke its silence about a riot and fire in a police station’s cells that killed dozens of prisoners on Wednesday, issuing a statement on Friday night sending condolences to relatives and promising an investigation.
“The Bolivarian government of the Venezuelan republic ... sends its profound condolences to the relatives and loved ones of each of the people who died in this unfortunate incident,” the statement by the Foreign Ministry read.
The statement did not give any details on the cause of the disaster, which inmates’ relatives and a surviving prisoner told Reuters stemmed from a shootout with police in an overcrowded and lawless jail.
Venezuela’s opposition says leftist president Nicolas Maduro’s response to the 68 deaths in Valencia has been woefully insufficient. Maduro has yet to personally speak about the incident and has instead been tweeting about Easter holidays, a visit by Hollywood actor Danny Glover, and the upcoming presidential election.
In its statement, Venezuela also criticized the United Nations human rights office for “precipitated and disproportionate” comments about the disaster.
From Geneva, the United Nations had called on Venezuelan authorities to carry out a speedy investigation and provide reparations to victims’ families.
Venezuela’s Foreign Ministry said those comments betrayed “bias” and were part of a “multi pronged attack” against the South American nation.
Prison violence has been an issue in Venezuela long before Maduro’s late predecessor Hugo Chavez took office in 1999. Chavez once described the problem as the world's most ""savage"" and promised to clean it up.
But opposition politicians said the Valencia disaster was another sign of the ruling socialists' incompetence in a country that is deep in economic crisis and is plagued with food shortages, hyperinflation, and rampant crime.

“While in Venezuela all sorts of human rights violations are going on, Maduro is busy with ... increasing his levels of corruption and showing that he is an incapable leader who has the people going without food and medicine,” said opposition lawmaker Angel Alvarez from Carabobo state, where the jail riot occurred.

Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab and electoral board president Tibisay Lucena were also named in the advisory along with Socialist Party No. 2 Diosdado Cabello, the elder brother of late president Hugo Chavez, and 16 firms in Venezuela.
The economy and finance ministry's National Commission Against Money Laundering released the list late on Thursday, following its initial announcement on Tuesday. 
Maduro's socialist government has repeatedly vowed to combat corruption that has plagued Venezuela and its oil industry for decades, contributing to its devastating economic collapse. 
But critics say the administration, despite making graft-related arrests, is still crippled by financial malfeasance. 
Millions of Venezuelans suffer from food and medicine shortages, and the currency has fallen 99.99 percent against the U.S. dollar on the black market since Maduro came to power in 2013.
Panama's advisory calls on financial and non-financial entities in the country to redouble efforts to prevent risk in any transaction involving the listed people and companies. 
""It's recommended... that they adopt policies and procedures of ample due diligence,"" says the document. 
In Caracas, Maduro's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

The United States has slammed Caracas with a wave of sanctions and other measures to pressure Maduro for change, and is considering adding broad oil sanctions that would target the linchpin of Venezuela's economy.

(Reuters) - A white Louisiana police officer was fired on Friday and a second suspended for the killing of Alton Sterling, a black man shot in a 2016 incident that inflamed the U.S. debate on racial bias in law enforcement, a police official said.
Baton Rouge officer Blane Salamoni, who shot Sterling in a confrontation outside a convenience store, was dismissed for violating department standards on use of force and for losing his temper, Police Chief Murphy Paul told a news conference.
The second officer, Howie Lake, was suspended for three days for failing to maintain his composure. The decisions followed an administrative review of the July 2016 shooting, and both officers plan to appeal, Paul said.
The steps are designed ""to bring closure to a cloud that has been over our community for far too long,"" he said.
Sterling was among black men slain by police whose deaths sparked U.S. protests and helped fuel the Black Lives Matter movement. 
Police released four videos of the confrontation with Sterling outside a convenience store, where he was selling CDs.
Paul called the footage from a police dash camera, officers' body cameras, and a store surveillance camera ""graphic and shocking to the conscience.""
Salamoni's camera shows him yelling at Sterling with expletives to put his hands on a car. He points a gun at his Sterling's head and shouts he will shoot him if he moves.
While struggling with Sterling, both officers' cameras came loose. Lake's footage ends by showing Sterling on his back in the parking lot, blood draining from his body.
Sterling, 37, was shot after a resident reported he had been threatened by a black man selling CDs. Police said Sterling was trying to pull a loaded gun out of his pocket when Salamoni opened fire.
Lawyers representing Sterling's five children applauded Salamoni's firing, but expressed disappointment that the officers would not face charges.
""The person who was out of control was Blane Salamoni,"" attorney Michael Adams said at a news conference. ""The person who stood by and let him be out of control was Howie Lake. That’s a tragedy.""
Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said this week that Lake and Salamoni would not face charges since they had reason to believe that Sterling was armed and was resisting arrest.
The U.S. Department of Justice declined to prosecute the officers for civil rights violations in 2017, citing insufficient evidence.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Friday asked a judge to sentence Macau billionaire Ng Lap Seng to more than six years in prison, after his conviction last July for bribing two U.N. ambassadors to help him build a multi-billion dollar conference center.
Prosecutors made their request in a filing with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, and are also seeking a $2 million fine.
The request came four weeks after Ng's lawyers urged that their 69-year-old client be sentenced to time served, and allowed to return to his family in China.
Lawyers for Ng did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ng's sentencing by U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick is scheduled for May 11. Probation officials recommended a six-year prison term.
Ng was convicted on all six counts he faced, including bribery, money laundering and corruption, after a four-week trial and less than a day of jury deliberations.
Prosecutors accused him of paying more than $1 million of bribes to officials including the late former U.N. General Assembly President John Ashe.
They said Ng hoped the conference center, which was never built, would pave the way for luxury housing, hotels, a shopping mall, marinas and a heliport, turning Macau into the ""Geneva of Asia"" and winning himself fame and greater riches.
""The defendant, a sophisticated, international businessman, repeatedly used his wealth and power to seek to corrupt decision-making at the United Nations,"" prosecutors said in Friday's filing. ""That was a choice. It warrants substantial and meaningful punishment.""
Defense lawyers have said Ng's goals were consistent with the types of public-private partnerships that the United Nations favors, and that other diplomats abused Ng's trust.
In their sentencing request, they called it ""far more reasonable"" to conclude that Ng's motivations were patriotic and philanthropic.
They also said there was ""no chance of recidivism,"" and that Ng could assure the court that once in China, he would not seek to return to the United States or conduct business there.

Ng has been allowed to live in his Manhattan apartment under 24-hour guard on $50 million bail. He was arrested in 2015.

Francis, 81, presided at a traditional Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession around Rome's ancient Colosseum attended by 20,000 people on the day that Christians commemorate Jesus' death by crucifixion.
Security was tighter than last year, with more checks as participants approached the area. This week, Italian police carried out four raids against suspected supporters of Islamist terrorism, arresting seven people, including one man who was planning a truck attack.
The Colosseum, in Rome's historic center, is one of the tourist attractions in the city where police have set up military jeeps and armored vehicles to form barriers against truck attacks. Several have also been set up near the Vatican. 
Francis wove his comments, made at the end of the torchlight service, around the themes of shame and repentance, conjuring up the image of a modern world where pride, arrogance and selfishness often trump humility and generosity.
Speaking in somber tones, he spoke of ""shame because so many people, even some of your (God's) ministers, have let themselves be deceived by ambition and vainglory, thereby losing their worthiness .. ""
Since his election in 2013, Francis has often urged Catholic priests and prelates to live simply, to serve others, and not to seek careers and status in the Church or in society at large.
Good Friday, the most somber day of the Christian liturgical calendar, commemorates the day the Bible says Jesus was crucified. The Way of the Cross service marks 14 events, called stations, from the time Roman governor Pontius Pilate condemns Jesus to death until his burial in a tomb.
""SENSE OF SHAME""
Francis said many people in the world today should feel ""shame for having lost a sense of shame"", adding that shame could be seen as a ""grace"" from God.
He said many should feel ""shame because our generations are leaving young people a world that is fractured by divisions and wars, a world devoured by selfishness ...""
The leader of the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics praised those in the Church who are trying to arouse ""humanity's sleeping conscience"" through their work helping the poor, immigrants, and prison inmates.
This year's meditations, one for each of the ""stations"" were written by high school and college students in Rome.
Earlier on Friday in St Peter's Basilica, Francis presided at a ""Passion of the Lord"" service, during which he prostrated himself in prayer on the marble pavement. 

On Saturday night, Francis leads an Easter vigil service and on Easter Sunday he delivers his twice-yearly ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) message.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council blacklisted dozens of ships and shipping companies on Friday over oil and coal smuggling by North Korea, boosting pressure on Pyongyang as leader Kim Jong Un plans to meet with his South Korean and U.S. counterparts.
The council's North Korea sanctions committee acted on a request by the United States, designating 21 shipping companies -- including five based in China -- 15 North Korean ships, 12 non-North Korean ships and a Taiwanese man.
The move comes days after Kim met Chinese President Xi Jinping and an announcement that the North Korean leader would meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in on April 27. He is also scheduled to meet U.S. President Donald Trump some time in May.
While Trump has agreed to meet Kim, he tweeted on Wednesday that ""maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained.""
Tension over North Korea's tests of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles surged last year and raised fears of U.S. military action in response to the North's threat to develop a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.
But the situation has eased significantly since North Korea sent athletes to the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said the U.N. sanctions designations -- the largest agreed by the council's committee -- were aimed at shutting down North Korea's illegal smuggling activities to obtain oil and sell coal.
""The approval of this historic sanctions package is a clear sign that the international community is united in our efforts to keep up maximum pressure on the North Korean regime,"" she said in a statement. 
The list was part of a request by Washington late last month for 33 ships, 27 shipping companies and the Taiwanese man to be sanctioned. China delayed that bid on March 2, but did not give a reason. The 15-member committee works by consensus. 
Washington then proposed a shortened list on Thursday, which was unanimously agreed by the committee on Friday.
The 12 non-North Korea ships are now subjected to a global port ban and must be deregistered, while the 15 North Korean ships are subjected to an asset freeze and 13 of those a global port ban.
The Taiwanese man, Tsang Yung Yuan, is accused of coordinating ""North Korean coal exports with a North Korean broker operating in a third country, and he has a history of other sanctions evasion activities,"" according to the U.N. listing. He is subjected to an asset freeze and travel ban. 
The assets of the 21 shipping companies, which include businesses based in the Marshall Islands, Singapore, Panama and Samoa, must now be frozen. 

The U.N. Security Council has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, banning exports including coal, iron, lead, textiles and seafood, and capping imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products.

MINGORA, Pakistan (Reuters) - In the Pakistani hometown of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai, reminders are frequent of the daughter of scenic northwestern Swat Valley who survived a gun attack – and so are memories of harsh rule by the Taliban.
Yousafzai is visiting Pakistan for the first time since the Pakistani Taliban - now on the run but still able to launch attacks - shot her in the head in 2012 over her advocacy for girls' education and opposition to Islamist militancy. 
By late Friday it was not yet clear whether security considerations would allow Yousafzai to return to Swat Valley, but many are eagerly awaiting her. 
""We're very happy that Malala has come to Pakistan. We welcome Malala,"" said Arfa Akhtar, a third grade student in a school where Yousafzai once studied. ""I'm also Malala. I'm with Malala in this mission.""
Barkat Ali, 66, says he remembers holding Malala in his lap when she was a child in Mingora. He is proud of the 20-year-old's struggle to promote girls' education, just as he is of his refusal 10 years ago to turn over his son when the Taliban demanded new fighters.
""They were the old illiterate people who would say that our daughters will not go to schools,"" Ali said, recalling two mortar shells landing in his street, often patrolled by the Taliban.
""Now people have become sensible. They educate their girls.""
The Pakistani Taliban took over much of the valley starting in 2007, banning girls' education, killing people, flogging women and hanging bodies from electric poles to enforce their harsh interpretation of Islamic law before the Pakistani army drove them out in 2009.
Not everyone in Swat, though, has such reverence for Yousafzai who became the youngest Nobel laureate in history in 2014 at age 17.
Swat resident Mohammad Nisar Khan says the international celebrity and official protection given to the young woman overshadows the sacrifices made by others in Swat.
""We were the ones who stood up against the Taliban... My four uncles and two cousins were slaughtered by the Taliban in Matta. They were brutally martyred. Yet, no one has asked about me,"" Khan said.
""Can someone show me one brave deed that Malala Yousafzai has performed ... that we have not performed at age 50?""
Elsewhere in parts of Pakistan, her arrival was met with outright hostility from those who accuse her of building a career abroad by painting a negative picture of her homeland.
In the eastern city of Lahore, a group of private schools staged a protest with teachers and their students chanting ""I am not Malala"", some wearing black armbands.
The organizer of the protest, Kashif Mirza, said dozens of private school chains participated and teachers told students in classes ""that Malala does not represent true Pakistan"".
""She maligned Pakistan, Islam and the Pakistani army after going abroad,"" said Mirza, who leads the President of All Pakistan Private Schools Federation. He said his group condemned the gun attack on Yousafzai but said since going abroad she had been influenced by foreign powers.
Other private schools, however, declined to join the anti-Malala protest.
""No such day was observed in any of our branches, because we don't support any event which spreads hatred,” said Tabraiz Bokhari, spokesman of Beacon House School System, with 200 affiliates across Pakistan.
In the nine years since the army drove out the Taliban, Swat has become mostly peaceful, though there are still occasional militant attacks including one several weeks ago targeting the military.
Many Swat residents, including family friend Jawad Iqbal, are hopeful Malala will be able to return on this trip.
""The people of Swat and the whole of Pakistan are with Malala,” Iqbal said standing in front of a portrait of Yousafzai with her father, who is a teacher.
“God willing, we will counter the terrorism and extremism in our region with the weapon of education, with the weapon of a pen, with the weapons of teachers and with the weapons of books.""
Along the road where Malala was shot on her school bus, resident Amir Zeb also said he hopes Malala will visit her hometown.

""Malala Yousafzai is the daughter of Pakistan,"" he said, adding. ""We're proud of her.""

The 136 migrants, from Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, were rescued in the violent southeastern state of Veracruz after 24 hours in temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius), Mexico's migration institute INM said.
Tens of thousands of Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty in their homelands aim to pass through Mexico to the United States every year, often transported by human traffickers who subject them to perilous conditions.
More than 800 Central American migrants have been found in truck trailers or safe houses in Mexico so far this year, according to a government document seen by Reuters.
Border apprehensions fell when U.S. President Donald Trump took office last year and vowed to stamp out illegal immigration, suggesting fewer crossing attempts, but have picked up in recent months.
The migrants in Veracruz were discovered by federal police and migration agents who heard cries for help from within the truck, which had been abandoned near a freeway.
Authorities said they counted 49 minors among the group, 13 of whom were traveling alone and will receive aid to apply for refugee status in Mexico. The adults, as well as the accompanied children, will be sent back to their home countries.
Last month, 103 Central Americans, including 36 minors, were rescued from an abandoned truck in the violent northern state of Tamaulipas, where migrants often attempt illegal border crossings.
In July, 10 people died after a truck stuffed with more than 100 Guatemalan and Mexican migrants was abandoned in a Texas parking lot.

166,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2018 02:55AM ET</span>",Trump tells advisers he wants U.S. out of Syria: senior officials,"By Steve Holland
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has told advisers he wants an early exit of U.S. troops from Syria, two senior administration officials said on Friday, a stance that may put him at odds with U.S. military officials who see the fight against Islamic State as nowhere near complete. 
A National Security Council meeting is set for early next week to discuss the U.S.-led campaign against Islamic State in Syria, according to U.S. officials familiar with the plan. 
Two other administration officials confirmed a Wall Street Journal report on Friday that said Trump had ordered the State Department to freeze more than $200 million in funds for recovery efforts in Syria while his administration reassesses Washington's role in the conflict there. 
Trump called for the freeze after reading a news report that the U.S. had recently committed an additional $200 million to stabilize areas recaptured from Islamic State, the paper said. 
The funding was announced by departing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in February at a meeting in Kuwait of the global coalition against Islamic State. 
The decision to freeze the funds was in line with Trump's declaration during a speech in Richfield, Ohio, on Thursday, where he said it was time for America to exit Syria. 
A spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council said that ""in line with the President's guidance, the Department of State continually re-evaluates appropriate assistance levels and how best they might be utilized, which they do on an ongoing basis."" 
Trump is spending Easter weekend at his Palm Beach, Florida, estate. 
""We'll be coming out of Syria, like, very soon,"" Trump said on Thursday, based on allied victories against Islamic State militants. 
""Let the other people take care of it now. Very soon, very soon, we're coming out,"" Trump said. ""We're going to get back to our country, where we belong, where we want to be.""
Trump's comments came as France said on Friday it could increase its military presence in Syria to bolster the U.S.-led campaign. 
While the Pentagon has estimated that Islamic State has lost about 98 percent of the territory it once held in Iraq and Syria, U.S. military officials have warned that the militants could regain the freed areas quickly unless they are stabilized.
Trump still needs to be convinced of that, said the U.S. officials with knowledge of the NSC meeting. 
U.S. DELIBERATIONS
The two administration officials who confirmed the Wall Street Journal report and spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said Trump's comments on Thursday reflected internal deliberations with advisers in which he has wondered aloud why U.S. forces should remain with the militants on their heels. 
Trump has made clear that ""once ISIS and its remnants are destroyed that the United States would be looking toward having countries in the region playing a larger role in ensuring security and leaving it at that,"" one official said.
Such a policy is nowhere near complete, however, the official added. 
The second official said Trump's national security advisers have told him U.S. forces should stay in small numbers for at least a couple of years to make sure gains against the militants are held and ensure Syria does not essentially become a permanent Iranian base. 
Top national security aides discussed Syria in a White House meeting recently but have yet to settle on a strategy for U.S. forces in Syria to recommend to Trump going forward, the official said. 
""So far he has not given an order to just get out,"" the official said. About 2,000 U.S. troops are deployed in Syria. 
Trump last year went through a similar wrenching debate over whether to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan, ultimately agreeing to keep them there but only after repeatedly raising questions of why they should stay. 

Trump's view on Syria may put him at odds with those of former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, named by Trump a week ago to replace H.R. McMaster as White House national security adviser.

168,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2018 12:08PM ET</span>",'I've never been so happy': Nobel winner Malala in Pakistan,"By Kay Johnson
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai says she has pined for her home in Pakistan's picturesque Swat Valley, even as she recalled two years living in fear under the Taliban's harsh interpretation of Islamic law.
Visiting her homeland for the first time since a Taliban gunman shot her in the head over her blog advocating girls' education, 20-year-old Yousafzai also contradicted Pakistani critics who accuse her of promoting an ideology at odds with the country's Islamic values.
""I am proud of my religion, and I am proud of my country,"" she told Reuters in an interview at her hotel on Friday. 
Wearing a rose-printed head scarf and flowing tunic and trousers - one of many outfits family and friends brought her from Pakistan to Britain, where she is studying at Oxford University - Yousafzai said she was elated at being home. 
""I had never been so excited for anything. I've never been so happy before,"" she said, though she would not discuss whether she had received security clearance to visit Swat.
""I miss everything about Pakistan ... right from the rivers, the mountains, to even the dirty streets and the garbage around our house, and my friends and how we used to have gossip and talk about our school life, to how we used to fight with our neighbors.""
She said she has wanted to return before but, aside from security concerns, there was the hectic pace of school and her entry exams to Oxford, where she began studying last year for a degree in politics, philosophy and economics.
NOBEL PRIZE
Yousafzai's journey to becoming the youngest ever Nobel winner began with the local branch of the hardline Taliban movement taking over her hometown in Swat, about 250 km (160 miles) from the capital, Islamabad, in 2007, when she was 9 years old.
The Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) banned television, music and girls' education, and burned about 200 schools, following the example of the 1990s Taliban government in neighboring Afghanistan, which forcibly excluded women from nearly every aspect of public life.
""I still remember each and every moment, right from the fear while sleeping at night that you might not be alive the next day,"" Yousafzai said. ""The fear that if you are going to school, someone might stop you and throw acid in your face.""
Her father was a teacher in a school that educated girls and managed to stay open until early 2009. 
After the Pakistani army drove out the Taliban in mid-2009 she became a symbol for girls' education through a blog she wrote for the BBC's Urdu service, which started while the Taliban were still in power, and a documentary ""Class Dismissed"", that profiled her.
It made her a target. In 2012, a masked gunman boarded her school bus, singled her out and shot her. The Taliban later said it had carried out the attack for her promotion of liberalism.
She was flown to Britain for surgery and has remained abroad since, co-writing a best-selling book ""I Am Malala"" and starting a foundation advocating girls' education worldwide.
In 2014 she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, along with an Indian activist.
POLARIZING FIGURE
Though she is perhaps the world's best-known Pakistani, Yousafzai - known almost universally as just ""Malala"" - is polarizing figure at home, beloved by many but reviled by others.
A group of private schools in Pakistan declared Friday to be ""I Am Not Malala Day"", for what its spokesman described as her ""anti-Islam and anti-Pakistan ideology"".
That description puzzles Malala.
""I just don't know anything I've said that makes me anti-Pakistan or anti-Islam,"" she said. ""Islam has taught me the importance of peace. Islam has taught me the importance of education. The first word of Islam, or the first word of the Koran, is 'Iqra' which means 'read'.""
Government commitment to education was one of the subjects of her meeting on Thursday with Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, whose government, along with the army, helped arrange her trip, including providing security.
""We did talk about education and I appreciated what he has done, but I think there is a lot more that needs to be done. The government promised 4 percent of GDP for education but only so far has increased it to 2.7,"" she said.
Meetings with the prime minister - as well as other world leaders - might seem a far cry from a schoolgirl's life in the Swat Valley, but Malala said some aspects of her life, like attending Oxford, were longtime dreams.
""My initial plan was that I would continue my education, I would continue speaking out for the girls who cannot go to school ... and one day once I finish my secondary education, I will apply to Oxford,"" she said.

""So it was in my plan ... I did not know that this attack would happen and I would move to the UK, but I wanted to focus on Pakistan and continue to do as much as I could for girls education.""

The report by finance, sports and infrastructure inspectors called for Olympic village plans to be revised to take account of remnants of archaeological value at the site, a residency for migrants and a high school.
It said plans for a media village should be scaled down and it warned that the swimming center and surrounding developments were at risk of running as much as 170 million euros ($210 million) over budget.
""At this point the total potential risks identified by the cases under consideration stand at 500 million euros,"" the report said, adding the figure could be kept to 200 million if its recommendations were followed.
""Nonetheless, the main risk is that indispensable structures are not delivered in time for the Olympic and Paralympic Games,"" it said.
The overall budget for hosting the games was initially set at 6.8 billion euros, with an investment of public money of 1.5 billion euros. 
Separate reports from the Senate and the public audit office have already warned that a massive expansion of the Paris metro network may run billions over budget and not be ready in time for the Olympics.

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - The widow of the Pulse nightclub gunman walked free on Friday after a jury cleared her of charges related to the 2016 massacre that killed 49 people in Orlando, stunning survivors who had longed to hold someone accountable.
Noor Salman, 31, could have faced up to life in prison had she been convicted of federal charges of obstruction of justice and aiding her husband, Omar Mateen, in providing support to the Islamic State militant group.
Instead, the U.S. District Court jury in Orlando acquitted Salman after roughly 12 hours of deliberation that began on Wednesday. Hours later, she walked out of Orange County jail, her head bowed as she held hands with defense lawyer Fritz Scheller.
""We just relived the whole thing all over again,"" said India Godman, who was in the nightclub when shots rang out, killing 14 of her friends.
Salman was home with the couple's then 3-year-old son at the time of the rampage on June 12, 2016. Mateen died in an exchange of gunfire with police at Pulse, a gay nightspot.
The acquittal was an emotional blow for the survivors and families of those killed. The attack stunned and dismayed lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and Latinos who frequented Pulse. 
Godman was among several survivors and their supporters who gathered on Friday outside Pulse, about 2 miles (3 km) from the courthouse.
""I'm in shock. I think that she knew that he was up to something,"" said Neema Bahrami, an event manager at the nightclub who survived the shooting while his best friend was killed. 
Then the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, it has since been surpassed by the Las Vegas attack in which a shooter opened fire on an outdoor concert from his hotel room last year, killing 58 people.
When U.S. District Judge Paul Byron announced Friday's verdict, Salman broke down in tears and hugged her defense lawyers, according to reporters inside the courtroom. Her relatives gasped while families of the victims sat silently, showing little emotion. 
""We knew from day one she was innocent,"" Salman's aunt, Susan Adieh, told reporters just after the verdict.
Salman, who had been jailed during the trial, will move to California, where she has relatives, a spokeswoman for the family said.""This was really her opportunity to clear her name and move on with her life,"" spokeswoman Susan Clary said. ""She just really needs to get back to her son.""
Mateen, 29, opened fire shortly after 2 a.m. during Latin night, shooting patrons on the dance floor and spraying bullets at others hiding in bathroom stalls. He then held hostages during a standoff with police, claiming allegiance to a leader of Islamic State before he was shot dead.
Prosecutors said Salman cased possible attack sites with her husband and did nothing to stop his plans. They claimed she initially told investigators her husband acted without her knowledge but later said she knew he was watching Islamic State videos, had purchased an assault rifle, and examined three possible attack locations.
However, the Federal Bureau of Investigation did not record the interrogation and the defense said she was coerced into making statements.
The jury appeared to believe the defense portrayal of Salman as a battered spouse kept in the dark, said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor and now a partner at Coral Gables, Florida-based Hinshaw & Culbertson.

""The lack of a videotaped confession had to have had an impact on the jury's acceptance of her confession. ... It is clear they believed it was coerced,"" Weinstein said in a statement.

Greece has contested Macedonia's name since it broke away from the former Yugoslavia in 1991, arguing it implied a claim on Greece's own region of Macedonia as well as its history.
U.N. envoy Matthew Nimetz brokered a deal in 1995 allowing the Balkan state to join the U.N under the temporary designation ""Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"", but talks since have failed to settle on a permanent name acceptable to both sides.
A new round of talks began in January, and Skopje is hoping for a solution by a July summit of NATO, which it is seeking to join.
""Difficult issues were addressed - they're still on - difficult issues were resolved,"" Nimetz said in Vienna after meeting the foreign ministers of both countries.
""In my opinion, having been in this a very long time, there is a very positive feeling ... I'm hopeful that we can continue to work in a very positive way,"" he said. A series of talks would take place in the coming months, he added.
Greece's foreign minister, Nikos Kotzias, told reporters the two sides had identified the main issues dividing them.
""I hope that at our next meeting we will be ready to take a big step,"" he said. 
Both countries have said they would be ready to accept a compound name with a geographical qualifier such as ""northern"" or ""upper"" Macedonia, but they have yet to agree if that would require a change to Macedonia's constitution and to what extent.
A solution would pave Macedonia's way towards NATO and EU membership, both of which have been blocked by Athens.
Macedonia's Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov was quoted as saying by state news agency MIA that there had been ""conditional progress in the negotiations.""

""It is not surprising that the more openly and more concretely we walk towards a solution, the more the difficulties come to light,"" he said.

The elections are considered a dry run for the presidential vote to be held in 2019 and a test of whether Afghanistan's Western-backed government can overcome past election problems of poor security and fraud.
President Ashraf Ghani and international donor countries have all said elections need to happen this year. Some Western diplomats doubt, however, that there is enough time to organize the vote in 2018. 
The Independent Elections Commission (IEC) would hold the election on Oct. 20, IEC chairman Gula Jan Abdul Badi Sayad said on Friday. He said voter registration would start in mid-April.
The current parliament's five-year term was to expire in June 2015, but Ghani extended it by decree amid security fears and disagreements on how to prevent fraud. 
The main challenges ahead of the vote are registering Afghans, many of whom do not have identification documents, and setting up ballot stations in remote areas. Plans for voter security and preventing fraud are also critical. 
Afghanistan has held two parliamentary elections since the end of Taliban rule, in 2005 and 2010. District council elections have never been held.

The 2014 presidential election produced no agreed winner and led to a U.S.-brokered deal that saw former rivals Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah forced into an uneasy coalition that has struggled to win popular support.

The explosion struck a checkpoint on Thursday at the eastern exit of Ajdabiya, a town south of Benghazi, a military source said. It is close to the oil export ports of Brega and Zueitina.
Amaq said 14 troops of General Khalifa Haftar had been killed of wounded. His forces allied to a parallel government based in the east control Ajdabiya and much of eastern Libya.
According to medics, six people were killed and nine wounded.
Islamic State, which lost in 2016 its stronghold Sirte in central Libya, had in October claimed an attack about 60 km (37 miles) south of Ajdabiya during which two soldiers were killed.
The group has retreated since the fall of Sirte to camps in the desert in southern Libya from where it has launched suicide bombings and attacks in coastal towns.

President Donald Trump had indicated on Thursday the United States would be withdrawing forces from Syria ""very soon"".
The SDF, which is spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, has been the main partner for the U.S.-led coalition in Syria, where some 2,000 U.S. forces are operating in the fight against Islamic State, also known as ISIS.
""Our work and coordination (with the coalition) is continuing in the framework of the support program and joint operations in all regions,"" SDF spokesman Kino Gabriel told Reuters in a written message.
Referring to Trump's statement, he said it ""was not clear"", and noted ""statements that came from other American officials in the American administration did not confirm that or deny it"".
Asked whether the United States would be withdrawing troops from Syria, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said she was not aware of any such plan.
Asked on Friday whether U.S. forces had been informed of a decision to withdraw or were preparing to do so, the spokesman for the coalition said he would not comment on future operations.
In emailed answers to Reuters, Col. Ryan Dillon said Islamic State still held territory at two locations in Syria - near Hajin along the Euphrates River and at Dashisha near the border with Iraq.
He said coalition offensive operations had been limited as a result of events in northwest Syria, where the SDF and YPG have been fighting a Turkish incursion targeting the YPG in the Afrin region.

""The coalition and the SDF continue to find opportunities to exploit ISIS weaknesses and conduct strikes against the remaining terrorists,"" he said.

Galizia, killed in a car-bomb attack in Oct. 2017, had reported that the Maltese prime minister's wife was the ultimate beneficiary of funds in a secret company in Panama, including funds from Azerbaijan transferred through Pilatus Bank. 
    The prime minister and his wife have denied the accusation, and a magistrate's investigation in Malta is under way.
Three men have been charged with Galizia's death.
Efimova has been held in the women's wing of the Korydallos maximum security prison in Athens since earlier in March. Greek lawyer Alexandros Papasteriopoulos told Reuters TV in an interview in Athens that she turned herself in because she felt there was a risk to her safety.
""She received a message that, 'you have to protect yourself' and therefore she went to seek for this protection from the Greek police,"" he said. He did not say who sent Efimova the message.
A Greek court is scheduled to hear a Maltese extradition request on April 12 for Efimova on the strength of an arrest warrant for alleged misappropriation of funds.
Efimova denies the charges brought by her former employers and says she had permission to use the money. Papasteriopoulos said she has filed a lawsuit against the bank for unpaid wages.
""She says that 'I will never have any fair trial in Malta and I am directly afraid of (sic) my life', this is very clear,"" Papasteriopoulos said.
On Tuesday anti-corruption activists in Malta wrote to Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras urging him to grant asylum to Efimova, but Papasteriopoulos said it was unlikely she would request it. 

""Malta is a European member state and its quite difficult to prove that the rule of law is severely violated there, so I don't think that at the time being she thinks of submitting a political asylum request in Greece,"" he said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia expelled 59 diplomats from 23 countries on Friday and said it reserved the right to take action against four other nations in a worsening standoff with the West over the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Britain.
Russia said it was responding to what it called the baseless demands for scores of its own diplomats to leave a slew of mostly Western countries that have joined London and Washington in censuring Moscow over the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia.
A day earlier, Moscow ordered the expulsion of 60 U.S. diplomats and the closing of the U.S. consulate in St Petersburg, Russia's second city, in retaliation for the biggest ejection of diplomats since the Cold War.
Preparations appeared to be under way on Friday to close the St Petersburg mission down, with a removals truck making repeated journeys to and from the consulate which took delivery of a large pizza order for its staff. 
Russia summoned senior envoys on Friday from most of the other countries that have expelled Russian diplomats and told them it was expelling a commensurate number of theirs. 
Russia has already retaliated in kind against Britain for ejecting 23 diplomats over the first known use of a military-grade nerve agent on European soil since World War Two. British ambassador Laurie Bristow was summoned again on Friday.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said Bristow had been told London had just one month to cut its diplomatic contingent in Russia to the same size as the Russian mission in Britain. 
A spokeswoman for the British Foreign Office did not say how many British diplomats would be affected, but said Russia's response was regrettable and Moscow was in flagrant breach of international law over the killing of the former spy. 
The poisoning, in southern England, has united much of the West in taking action against what it regards as the hostile policies of President Vladimir Putin. This includes the United States under President Donald Trump, who Putin had hoped would improve ties.
Russia rejects Britain's accusation it stood behind the attack and has cast the allegations as part of an elaborate Western plot to sabotage East-West relations and isolate Moscow.
The hospital where she is being treated said on Thursday that Yulia Skripal was getting better after spending three weeks in a critical condition due to the nerve toxin attack. Her father remains in a critical but stable condition.
The BBC, citing sources, reported on Friday that Yulia was ""conscious and talking"".
EXPULSIONS
During the course of Friday, the Russian Foreign Ministry summoned senior embassy officials from Australia, Albania, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, the Netherlands, Croatia, Ukraine, Denmark, Ireland, Spain, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Romania, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Canada and the Czech Republic. 
All were seen arriving in their official cars at the Foreign Ministry's gothic building in Moscow.
""They (the diplomats) were handed protest notes and told that in response to the unwarranted demands of the relevant states on expelling Russian diplomats ... that the Russian side declares the corresponding number of staff working in those countries' embassies in the Russian Federation persona non grata,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Four other countries -- Belgium, Hungary, Georgia and Montenegro -- had only ""at the last moment"" announced that they too were expelling Russian diplomats over the Skripal affair, and Moscow reserved the right to take retaliatory action against them too, it said.
Emerging from the Foreign Ministry building, German ambassador Rudiger von Fritsch said Russia had questions to answer about the poisoning of Skripal, but Berlin remained open to dialogue with Moscow.
The U.S State Department said after Russia announced the expulsions on Thursday evening that it reserved the right to respond further, saying the list of diplomats designated for expulsion by Russia showed Moscow was not interested in diplomacy.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, in a conference call with reporters on Friday, disagreed with that assessment, saying that Putin still favored mending ties with other countries, including with the United States.

""I refuse to sign this bill and I am sending it back to parliament to discuss it again,"" Duda said in a televised address, describing it as unfair.
The bill would have reduced to the rank of private those generals and military officers who served on the military council which ran Poland during communist times from December 1981 until July 1983, many of who are now deceased.
They would have had no right of appeal.
Duda's move may be seen as a bid to improve his chances for re-election in 2020. Support for the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), his ally, fell 12 percentage points over one month in a poll published on Thursday.
""One has to remember that a president who wants to win in the first or second round has to win much more votes than the ruling party in a general election,"" Rafal Chwedoruk, a political scientist from Warsaw University, said.
""A recent poll has shown that the vast majority of Poles are against demoting generals. ... The number of PiS voters from villages and small towns accepted the decision on imposing martial law,"" Chwedoruk said. 
The PiS has made much of its efforts to erase the legacy of four decades of post-war Soviet-dominated communist rule and restore what it considers to be Poland's true identity - even though some leading PiS figures are former communists.
The law would demote to the rank of private members of the Military Council of National Salvation (WRON), led by the late generals Wojciech Jaruzelski and Czeslaw Kiszczak.
But it would also demote 77-year-old Miroslaw Hermaszewski, Poland's only astronaut, one of the few WRON members still alive, who was drafted onto the council in 1981 without his knowledge or consent, and discharged from it after two weeks.
Hermaszewski spent almost eight days on board the Soviet Salyut space station in 1978, and is still seen as a national hero, also by PiS voters.

179,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2018 05:55PM ET</span>",U.S. visa applicants to be asked for social media history: State Department,"By Brendan O'Brien
(Reuters) - In a broad expansion of the information gathered from applicants for U.S. visas, the federal government is proposing to collect social media identities from nearly everyone who seeks entry into the United States, according to a State Department filing on Friday. 
The proposal, if approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), would require most immigrant and non-immigrant visa applicants to list all social media identities they have used in the past five years.
The information will be used to vet and identify them, according to the proposals, which would affect about 14.7 million people annually.
The proposals support President Donald Trump's promise to institute ""extreme vetting"" of foreigners entering the United states to prevent terrorism. 
Previously, under rules instituted last May, consular officials were instructed to collect social media identifiers only when they determined “that such information is required to confirm identity or conduct more rigorous national security vetting,” a State Department official said at the time.
The State Department said then that the tighter vetting would apply only to those “who have been determined to warrant additional scrutiny in connection with terrorism or other national security-related visa ineligibilities.” 
The American Civil Liberties Union expressed concern, saying the move would have a ""chilling"" effect on freedom of speech and association.
""People will now have to wonder if what they say online will be misconstrued or misunderstood by a government official,"" Hina Shamsi, director ACLU’s National Security Project, said in a statement. 
""We’re also concerned about how the Trump administration defines the vague and over-broad term ‘terrorist activities’ because it is inherently political and can be used to discriminate against immigrants who have done nothing wrong,"" she said.
""There is a real risk that social media vetting will unfairly target immigrants and travelers from Muslim-majority countries for discriminatory visa denials, without doing anything to protect national security.” 
The new proposal was published in the Federal Register on Friday. The public has 60 days to comment on the revised procedures before the OMB approves or rejects them.
If approved, the measures also will require applicants to submit five years of previously used telephone numbers, email addresses and their international travel history. They will be asked if they have been deported or removed from any country and whether family members have been involved in terrorist activities, the department said.
The department said it intends not to routinely ask most diplomatic and official visa applicants for the additional information.

The town of Douma, controlled by the Jaish al-Islam rebel group, is the last patch of eastern Ghouta still held by insurgents who have been routed in a ferocious offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian military that began in February.
Its recovery would seal a major victory for President Bashar al-Assad, crushing the last big rebel stronghold near Damascus seven years into a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions.
Thousands of people - fighters from other rebel factions, their families and other civilians - have been leaving for northwestern Syria from other parts of eastern Ghouta in convoys of buses that have been given safe passage to Idlib province.
Jaish al-Islam has so far refused such an evacuation, saying it amounts to forced demographic change by Assad and his allies. 
The Russian news agency Interfax quoted the Russian military's general staff as saying it had reached agreement with insurgents in Douma to leave, without saying where they would go.
""Agreement was reached today with the leaders of illegal armed groups on the departure in the near future of the rebels and their family members from the town of Douma,"" it cited Sergei Rudskoy, an official with the general staff, as saying.
The Jaish al-Islam military spokesman quickly denied the report. ""Our position is still clear and firm and it is rejecting forced displacement and demographic change in what remains of eastern Ghouta,"" Jaish al-Islam military spokesman Hamza Birqdar said in a message posted on his Telegram feed. 
But Mohammad Alloush, the group's political official, said the talks over Douma were moving in the right direction and the ""chances (of agreement) are getting stronger day after day"".
Alloush, who is based outside Syria, made the comments in a report whose accuracy he confirmed to Reuters.
Douma is surrounded by Syrian government forces. There are tens of thousands of civilians in the town.
Syrian state TV said a deal had nearly been reached for Jaish al-Islam to leave Douma to the Idlib, citing preliminary information. 
The government offensive in eastern Ghouta has killed more than 1,600 civilians, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says. It said a total of 144,000 people have now been displaced from eastern Ghouta.

While thousands have gone to rebel-held territory near the Turkish border, the bulk of the displaced have fled the fighting to shelters in government-held areas near eastern Ghouta.

DAKAR (Reuters) - Eight in ten Congolese have an unfavorable opinion of President Joseph Kabila - but nearly seven in ten don't think the December vote to replace him will be fair, according to a national poll published on Friday.
The survey, conducted last month by the Congo Research Group at New York University and Congolese polling firm BERCI, gives a rare glimpse into the national mood as Congolese wait to see if Kabila finally steps down after 17 years in power.
Elections in Democratic Republic of Congo are scheduled for Dec. 23, two years after Kabila's mandate officially expired. But Kabila, who succeeded his assassinated father in 2001, has refused to publicly commit to stepping down.
Uncertainty about his intentions and the prospect of the vote being delayed again have bred mistrust among Congo's 80 million people. Security forces have killed dozens of people during street protests against the president's extended rule. 
The political crisis has also contributed to rising militia violence in eastern Congo's borderlands with Rwanda and Uganda, where millions died from hunger, disease and conflict in wars around the turn of the century.
The Congo Research Group is directed by Jason Stearns, a former U.N. investigator in the country. Over 1,000 Congolese citizens in all 26 provinces were questioned. 
When asked if they had a ""good opinion, bad opinion or no opinion at all"" of their president, 80 percent said they had a bad opinion and 20 percent said they had a good opinion. In an indication of Kabila's polarizing effect, zero percent had no opinion.
Congolese are eager for change, according to the poll. Ninety-five percent of those surveyed said they planned to vote in December and 64 percent said they were optimistic about the country's future in the next five years.
Exiled opposition leader Moise Katumbi would lead the presidential vote with 24 percent, trailed by another opposition leader, Felix Tshisekedi, with 13 percent.
Katumbi's support has fallen from 38 percent in a previous poll by CRG and BERCI a year ago. The pollsters said that could be due to his two-year absence from the country after being accused of hiring foreign mercenaries.
Still, most in the vast nation that spans much of Central Africa are skeptical about the electoral process. Sixty-nine percent said they do not trust the electoral commission to conduct ""free, fair and transparent elections"", up from 54 percent last year.

The commission plans to use 100,000 electronic voting machines in December, a move that opposition leaders and international donors said could increase the risk of fraud.

U.S. intelligence agencies have called Kremlin-backed RT ""Russia's state-run propaganda machine"" and accused it of contributing to Moscow's campaign to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election, something Russia denies.
The U.S. Department of Justice forced RT to register as ""a foreign agent"" in November last year, a designation that requires it to disclose financial information.
Margarita Simonyan, RT's editor-in-chief, said on Thursday evening on social media that the channel was being ""kicked off the air"" in Washington because of its status as ""a foreign agent."" 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters on Friday that lawyers were examining the case. 
""These cable providers announced that they won't provide their services to RT,"" said Peskov. ""Lawyers are examining the details, but as of now and at first glance it looks like a groundless decision.""
Peskov said the Kremlin was deeply concerned about how Russian media were being treated in the United States. 
""It's a very worrying tendency,"" he said. ""They are demonstrating a discriminatory policy towards the media in the U.S., which probably breaks the law and contradicts all these statements about freedom of speech which we hear day and night from Washington.""

Rahim Namazov was an outspoken critic of the Azeri political leadership and served time in prison before seeking exile in France in 2010.
In a video posted on YouTube in December that year, Namazov said he was jailed after writing stories about brutality against soldiers in units of the Azeri military. He said he had spent six months in solitary confinement.
""It's the journalistic profession, the father of a family and the freedom of the press that has been attacked today,"" Karine Michelet-Traval, the mayor of Colomiers where the shooting occurred, said in a statement.
In separate comments to La Depeche newspaper, she said: ""You can't help but think this was a settling of scores.""
Namazov's wife was killed in the shooting. A police source said she had been shot in the head, apparently at close range. Witnesses spoke of hearing multiple gunshots, local media reported.
The local prosecutor is due to make a statement at 16h00 (1400 GMT).
Human Rights Watch said last year the Azeri government continued its crackdown on dissenting voices and that reports of torture persisted. It also said independent media outlets faced harassment and closure and critical journalists faced threats and intimidation aimed at silencing them.

Tension over North Korea's tests of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles surged last year and raised fears of U.S. military action in response to the North's threat to develop a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United States.
But the situation has eased significantly since North Korea decided to send athletes to the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February.
The two sides, still technically at war after the 1950-53 conflict ended with a ceasefire, not a truce, are set to hold their first summit in more than a decade on April 27, after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pledged his commitment to denuclearisation. 
Yang, a top Chinese diplomat and a member of China's elite Politburo, told Moon on a visit to Seoul it was a crucial moment for alleviating the situation on the Korean peninsula, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said.
""All sides must seize the moment, work together, promote smooth meetings that achieve positive outcomes between leaders of South and North Korea, and between North Korea and the United States, and in due course reopen a substantive political resolution process to the peninsula issue,"" Yang said.
Yang also informed Moon about Kim's visit to Beijing this week, the North Korean leader's first known foreign trip since he assumed power in 2011, where he met Chinese President Xi Jinping. 
Moon thanked Yang for China's contribution to the easing of tension on the peninsula, the Chinese ministry said in a statement.
Kim is scheduled to meet U.S. President Donald Trump in May to discuss the nuclear issue, although a time and place have not been set.
His pledge to denuclearise the Korean peninsula was reported by Chinese state media, but North Korea's official media made no mention of it, or Kim's anticipated meeting with Trump.
Kim and Trump had earlier exchanged insults and veiled threats of war but the U.S. leader made the surprising announcement this month that he was prepared to meet Kim.

Trump wrote on Twitter he had received a message from Xi late on Tuesday that his meeting with Kim ""went very well"" and that Kim looked forward to meeting the U.S. president.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Human Rights Watch declined on Friday an invitation from Singapore to give evidence at a public hearing on ""fake news"", saying the hearing was not a ""true consultation"" but a ""media event"".
A parliamentary committee has been reviewing possible measures to prevent ""deliberate online falsehoods"", mirroring efforts in various countries to tackle false information amid growing questions about the influence of internet companies.
Activists worry that laws aimed at stopping ""fake news"" could be used to stifle free speech.
The rights group, in a recent report that ruling party politicians in Singapore criticized, urged the government to amend or repeal laws that it said were too broadly worded and used to ""arrest, harass, and prosecute critical voices"".
Singapore later invited the group to give evidence at the hearing.
""We have ... reluctantly come to the conclusion that these hearings are not a true consultation on how best to deal with 'fake news', but a media event aimed to showcase those who agree with the government's views and criticize those who do not,"" Human Rights Watch said in a statement.
Singapore's parliament did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Vikram Nair, a member of the ruling People's Action Party, said this week Human Rights Watch had used ""clearly false"" examples to further its agenda and undermine public discourse in its report.
Human Rights Watch said it had tried to contact Singapore authorities before the publication of the report but received no response.
The eight-day hearing - the longest in Singapore's history - drew to a close on Thursday.
Two witnesses who gave evidence at the hearing filed formal complaints to the committee over the way evidence was presented in official summaries of their hearing, according to copies of the complaints the witnesses sent to Reuters.
""I was horrified to see my views so drastically misrepresented,"" Kirsten Han, a freelance journalist and activist, said in her complaint.
Another witness, Terry Xu, an editor of an online blog, asked that the summary be amended ""so as to reflect the entirety of what was said during the hearing"".
Representatives of the parliamentary committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the complaints.
The committee will prepare a report on possible new legislation in May, after parliament's mid-term break, its chairman, Charles Chong, told the final session on Thursday.

Boyko Borissov said the Black Sea country, as a current chair of the European Union presidency, needed to keep dialogue open with Russia amid an escalating standoff between the West and Moscow over the nerve agent attack on March 4.
After the first known use of a military-grade nerve agent on European soil since World War Two, most EU and NATO members, including the United States, have expelled Russian diplomats.
Several EU countries, including Greece, Cyprus, Portugal, Slovenia and Austria, however, have not joined the coordinated action.
Bulgaria has expressed its solidarity with its EU and NATO allies by recalling its ambassador from Moscow for consultations, Borissov said, but stressed that more evidence was needed for further action. 
""As chair of the European Council we must keep the communication channel (open), as we have done in times of an over-tensed situation in our region at present with Turkey. We must do the same with Russia,"" Borissov said. 
""At this stage, we do not think we should expel Russian diplomats and officials,"" Borissov said, after a meeting of the government's security council over the nerve gas attack that included a hearing of the Bulgarian ambassador to Moscow. 
Borissov said the ambassador will return to Russia after the Orthodox Easter on April 8.
Calls for Bulgaria to expel Russian diplomats have faced strong opposition both in the coalition government as well as in other political parties in parliament which favor pursuing good ties with Russia.
Bulgaria, which was liberated from Ottoman rule by Russia, became one of the most obedient Soviet satellite states during the Cold War. Many Bulgarians feel a strong cultural affinity for Russia, with which they share the Cyrillic script and orthodox Christianity.

Bulgaria is also almost fully reliant on Russian gas supplies, military equipment and tourism revenues.

WASHINGTON/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - A U.S. service member and another person from the U.S.-led coalition battling Islamic State were killed by an improvised explosive device in Syria, U.S officials said on Friday.
They are the first coalition service members to be killed or wounded in an attack this year.
Two U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity and citing initial information, said one of the people killed in the blast on Thursday blast was an American and the incident took place near the city of Manbij in northern Syria. They declined to comment on the nationality of the other individual.
Earlier on Friday, a coalition statement said two personnel had been killed and five wounded in Syria, but did not provide their nationalities. 
The explosion happened on Thursday night, the coalition statement said.
The wounded were evacuated for treatment, according to the statement. 
Manbij has largely been cleared of Islamic State and is significant because Turkey, which stormed the northern Syrian town of Afrin after an offensive against the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, has repeatedly threatened to push its operations farther east to Manbij.
About 10 coalition personnel have been killed in non-combat-related incidents since Jan. 1, including seven Americans who died in a helicopter crash in Iraq earlier this month.
Islamic State militants continue to carry out bombings, ambushes and assassinations in Syria and Iraq despite the collapse last year of the cross-border ""caliphate"" declared in 2014 by their leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, whose whereabouts are unknown.
The United States says it has about 5,200 troops in Iraq, deployed alongside Iraqi armed forces. Some 2,000 U.S. troops are in Syria, allied to a Kurdish-led alliance that holds the largest swath of territory still outside the control of forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad.
The American casualty comes a day after President Donald Trump said the United States would be leaving Syria ""very soon."" The State Department said it was not aware of any plans to withdraw from Syria.
Senior officials have said there is a need for a longer-term U.S. commitment in Syria. 
Last year, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he expected to see a larger U.S. civilian presence in Syria, including contractors and diplomats, as the fight against Islamic State militants nears its end and the focus turns toward rebuilding and ensuring the militants do not return. 
Mattis has previously stated that U.S. forces will stay in Syria as long as Islamic State fighters want to fight and prevent the return of an “ISIS 2.0.”

The prime minister had said he was not informed about the operation to deport the six, who were arrested in Kosovo on Thursday over links to schools financed by the Fethullah Gulen movement that Ankara blames for a failed 2016 coup.
""The entire operation - revoking their residence permits, detention, emergency deportation and the secret extradition to Turkey of the six Turkish citizens from Kosovo territory - was conducted without my knowledge and without my permission,” Haradinaj said in a statement.
It was not immediately when replacements for Interior Minister Flamur Sefaj and secret service chief Driton Gashi would be named.
At its peak, the Gulen movement operated schools in 160 countries from Afghanistan to the United States. Since the coup attempt, Turkey has pushed allies to close Gulen-run establishments. 
Kosovo has faced pressure from Turkey in past weeks to take action against schools funded by the Gulen movement.
Ankara said the six arrested in Kosovo on Thursday were responsible for recruitment in Gulen's network and helped people accused of connections to the network leave Turkey during a security crackdown in which tens of thousands of people have been sacked from their jobs or jailed over alleged Gulen links.

Ankara accuses Gulen, a U.S.-based Muslim cleric, of orchestrating the July 15, 2016 coup attempt, and has declared his movement a terrorist organization. He denies any connection with the abortive putsch.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party is struggling to change a ""perception"" that it is against minority Muslims and lower-caste people, a political ally said, which could cost it votes in a general election due next year.
Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) trounced the opposition at the last election in 2014, but it has lost a handful of recent by-elections after opposition groups banded together.
Veteran politician Ram Vilas Paswan, a federal minister and the chief of the Lok Jan Shakti (People's Power) Party, which is allied with the BJP and says it represents India's socially backward classes, predicted another term for Modi.
But he said the BJP would have to work toward changing its image as a group that caters mainly to upper-caste Hindus.
""Whatever the government is doing it is doing for everyone; even for the minority community it has done a lot,"" Paswan said in an interview in his bungalow, seated on a couch under a huge oil painting of himself.
""But despite everything, the perception is not changing among the minorities and the scheduled castes (socially backward classes) irrespective of the work being done.""
India's 1.3 billion people are about 80 percent Hindu and 14 percent Muslim, according to the latest census data. Backward classes make up about three-quarters of the Hindu population.
Critics say the BJP's Hindu nationalist agenda has polarized the population. 
Since Modi came to power in 2014, hardline Hindu groups and cow protection vigilantes have carried out numerous attacks on Muslims accused of eating beef or killing cows. 
Many Hindus believe cows are sacred and killing them is banned in most states. 
'WELL-MEANING'
A crackdown on abattoirs, tanneries and leather factories, mostly run by Muslims, has also hit a large number of lower-caste Hindus who transport cattle and work in tanneries. 
Paswan said the opposition could take advantage of the BJP's pro-upper class Hindu image and it needed to be countered aggressively.
The BJP said Paswan's comment was a ""well-meaning observation from an ally"" but that the party has ""foiled repeated attempts of the opposition Congress party to create an impression that the BJP is losing the perception battle"".
""We need to be cognizant of the fact that opposition parties have been raising a bogey of non-issues, but so far they've failed,"" said BJP spokesman G.V.L. Narasimha Rao.
When Modi won office in 2014, his party or its partners ruled only seven of India's 29 states. Today, it is in power in 21 of them and has replaced Congress as the party with strongest nationwide presence.
But in by-elections for 10 parliamentary seats since last year, the BJP has lost all of them and two small regional parties have walked out of the ruling coalition.
Paswan, whose party enjoys considerable support from the Muslim community in his home state of Bihar in the east, said ending ties with the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was ""unthinkable"".
""This is essentially a government of the BJP, they have an absolute majority. Still Modi has given space to allies like us,"" said Paswan, a 10-time member of parliament who began his political career in 1969. 

""Can't even think of leaving the NDA. No one has approached me and I am happy where I am.""

The group of dissenters in Prime Minister Theresa May's party includes two former cabinet ministers who are backing ""substantial"" cross-party amendments to the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, the report said.
The changes drawn up include one giving parliament a vote on staying in a customs union ""which is almost certain to pass"", the Guardian said. 
The withdrawal bill is testing May's ability to rule as her Conservatives are split on how best to enact Brexit, and she is dependent on a small party in Northern Ireland for her slim majority.
May has said that agreeing a new customs union, in which the EU's 28 members operate as a single tariff-free market, with the EU would be a ""betrayal"" of the 2016 referendum result.

May's working majority in the 650-seat house stands at around 13 seats. The group of Conservatives include Chris Patten, a former party chairman, and Douglas Hogg, a former agriculture minister.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - An autopsy on an unarmed black man killed by police officers in California's capital last week shows that none of the eight bullets hit him in the front, contradicting the official version of events, a lawyer for the deceased's family said on Friday.
Clark was hit six times in the back, once in the side and once in the leg, the independent autopsy found.
Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the family of Stephon Clark, a 22-year-old African-American killed in Sacramento on March 18, said the findings refuted police statements that the man had been moving toward officers in a menacing way when they fired. 
""This independent autopsy affirms that Stephon was not a threat to police and was slain in another senseless police killing under increasingly questionable circumstances,” Crump said in a statement.
Clark's death was the most recent in a string of fatal shootings of black men by police that have triggered protests across the United States and fueled a national debate about bias in the American criminal justice system.
The Sacramento Police Department said in a statement that it would have no further comment on the case until after the release of the findings of an official autopsy by the county coroner, and a review by state and local prosecutors. 
Dr. Bennet Omalu, the forensic pathologist who conducted the independent autopsy, said at a briefing that any one of seven bullets that entered the upper half of Clark's body could have killed him. 
""Each of these bullets independently possessed a fatal capacity, meaning ... all he needed was one of the seven to die,"" said Omalu, a Nigerian-born physician best known for his research into chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in American football players.
Clark's shooting has sparked largely peaceful demonstrations in Sacramento. On several occasions over the last two weeks, protesters have marched, held demonstrations and twice blocked fans from reaching games played by the Sacramento Kings NBA basketball team at the Golden 1 Center. 
Clark, a father of two, was gunned down in the backyard of his grandparents' house by police responding to a report that someone was breaking windows. Police said the officers who shot at Clark 20 times feared he was holding a firearm, but that he was later found to have been holding a cellphone.
The incident was captured in graphic detail in a body cam video released by the police on Wednesday.
""Prior to the shooting, the involved officers saw the suspect facing them, advance forward with his arms extended, and holding an object in his hands,"" a police statement released on Monday read. 
At the funeral service for Clark on Thursday, veteran civil rights leader the Reverend Al Sharpton said: ""We're going to make Donald Trump and the whole world deal with the issue of police misconduct,"" referring to the president. 
The service at a church in Sacramento came a day after White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters the shooting was a ""local matter."" 

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra has said state investigators will oversee the investigation and review the police department's procedures and practices.

""A complaint has been lodged and an inquiry is under way,"" said an aide to Brigitte Macron, who has lived in the private residence at the Elysee Palace with her husband, Emmanuel, since he was elected in May 2017.
The fraudsters failed in their attempts, the aide added.
News of the scam emerged on RTL radio, which said scores of mails were sent under an address name -- mailto:cabinet@presidence.fr, strikingly similar to official ones -- requesting among other favors the best table at a plush five-star restaurant and tickets to the Australian Formula 1 grand prix.
Emails had been sent as far afield as Hong Kong and Morocco too, raising concern that the scam may be designed to damage her reputation, said RTL.
French presidential spouses do not enjoy official status in the way that happens in countries like the United States.

But Brigitte Macron does engage informally as an organizer or sponsor of various causes and events; one was a performance of the Peter and the Wolf classical musical where her husband did the narrating for an audience of children at the Elysee.

197,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2018 04:50AM ET</span>",Most French want Macron crackdown on radical Islamists: polls,"By Brian Love
PARIS (Reuters) - Most French people want Muslims suspected of harboring extremist views detained if they appear on spy agency watchlists and would back a ban on ultra-conservative Salafist Islam, two polls showed after the latest deadly attack in France.
Right-wing opponents of Emmanuel Macron have demanded the president get tough on security and suggest there would be widespread public support for steps targeting mosques and imams preaching hate, as well as foreigners deemed a threat.
An Odoxa poll published on Friday showed 87 percent wanted people suspected of religious radicalization to be put in detention, and 88 percent favored banning Salafist Islam.
An Elabe survey showed 80 percent backed the expulsion of radicalized foreigners, while more than half of its respondents said Macron was not doing enough to counter terrorism.
The president wants to redraw the relationship between France's Muslims and the secular French state. He is not the first.
Since the late 1980s, successive Paris governments have tried but failed to nurture a liberal ""Islam of France"" that would help integrate the faith into a mostly secular society.
The issue is back in focus after a Moroccan-born French national killed four people in southwestern France on March 23, proclaiming allegiance to Islamic State. About 240 people have now been killed in France since early 2015 by militants or inspired by the ultra-hardline Islamic State group. 
Salafist Islam, the puritan literalist interpretation of the faith that is the basis for Islamic State's violent ideology, says Muslims must return to the practices of early Islam in the seventh century and shun many aspects of modern Western life.
Opposition politicians including center-right leader Laurent Wauquiez and far-right chief Marine Le Pen have demanded the expulsion of all foreigners on the so-called Fiche S watchlists of the intelligence services. They contain about 20,000 people, of which about 10,000 for reasons of religious radicalization or connections.
Former Socialist Prime Minister Manuel Valls urged the government to consider internment in cases where a real risk of militant activity is perceived.
Valls has also pressed for a ban on Salafism, a step current Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has so far dismissed.
""You cannot ban an idea but you can punish its consequences if they undermine public order, the laws or the republic or the basic rules of society,"" Philippe told lawmakers this week. 
France, a traditionally Catholic nation, formally separated church and state a century ago and strict secularism is the official rule. The country has Europe's largest Jewish and Muslim communities. The latter is estimated to number upwards of five million.

The comments by Ibrahim Kalin on Twitter came after French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday assured the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) of Paris' support to stabilize northeastern Syria against Islamic State.
A Kurdish official said Macron had pledged to send troops to the northeastern region controlled by the SDF. Ankara considers the Kurdish YPG, which forms the strongest force in the SDF, to be a terrorist group.
""We, as Turkey, reject far from serious approaches like 'dialogue, contacts, mediation' with such terror structures,"" Kalin wrote.
""Countries which we regard as friends and allies must display an open and clear stance against all kinds of terror, instead of taking steps which amount to legitimizing terror structures,"" he added, without naming any country.
The SDF has been at the forefront of the U.S.-led coalition's strategy to defeat Islamic State militants.
Macron on Thursday met for the first time with a delegation that included the YPG, its political arm the PYD, and Christian and Arab officials.
Turkey stormed the northwest Syrian town of Afrin earlier this month after a two-month offensive with Syrian rebel allies to push the YPG out of the region. It has repeatedly threatened to push its operations further east to Manbij where U.S. troops are stationed alongside the SDF. 
Speaking to Reuters after the meeting with Macron, Khaled Eissa, a PYD member who represents the northern Syria region in Paris, said Macron had promised to send more troops to the area, provide humanitarian assistance and push a diplomatic solution.

Opponents of Prime Minister Hun Sen accuse him of arresting Kem Sokha and cracking down on independent media and other critics in the face of what could have been his toughest electoral challenge in more than 30 years in power.
Hun Sen has ruled Cambodia for 33 years and is now widely expected to win the election on July 29. Western countries have said the election cannot be fair without an opposition.

201,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2018 05:48AM ET</span>","For one Catholic parish in China, division and confusion as historic deal looms","By James Pomfret
YINGTAN, China (Reuters) - Like many Chinese Catholics, Lin Jinqing was shocked when news trickled through to him of an impending deal between Beijing and the Vatican that would end a long dispute over control of the Church in China.
As a member of a so-called ""underground"" church – one that is not sanctioned by Beijing - in the southeastern province of Jiangxi, Lin and fellow parishioners have for years been attending clandestine Bible readings and services.
In recent years, as Chinese authorities cracked down on underground services as part of broader restrictions on religious groups, he has also started attending services at state-sanctioned churches in order to avoid trouble.
""The pressure on underground church members has been quite big,"" said Lin, who lives in Yingtan, a gritty city of one million people in southeastern Jiangxi province.
Now, the deal between China and the Vatican is worrying him.
""Many of us don't know what to think,"" he said. He said that the underground churchgoers wanted more freedom to worship. ""But at what cost?""
A senior Vatican source told Reuters last month that a framework accord was ready and could be signed in months. The expected deal would allow China to appoint bishops, in consultation with the Vatican, and eventually could lead to the restoration of full diplomatic relations between the two sides for the first time in seven decades.
Until now, China and the Vatican have not recognized most bishops named by each other. Underground Catholics like Lin have stayed loyal to Vatican-appointed bishops – and the Pope.
News of the impending deal has split communities of Catholics across China, according to some critics like Cardinal Joseph Zen in Hong Kong.
Some fear greater suppression should the Vatican cede greater control to Beijing, but others want to see rapprochement.
""We hope for an early establishment of ties. It will definitely bring advantageous policies, and greater openness to the Church,"" said Father Pan Yinbao, a priest affiliated with the official Church in Yingtan, in an interview with Reuters. ""There is a need for change. There is a need for adjustment.""
Lin's apprehensions, meanwhile, are echoed in WeChat groups used by Catholics, and the few uncensored religious news sites still viewable in China like www.tianzhujiao.life - as is cautious criticism.
""Churchgoers stay hopeful on the Vatican-China deal, but no one wants to live in a bird cage or only fighting for a larger space in the bird cage,"" read one post by a blogger named Priest Shanren. ""People are born to be free.""
The Chinese Communist Party has long sought to control organized groups, including religious ones, whose devotees can only worship under the auspices of state-sanctioned bodies, like the Catholic Patriotic Association.
Of the 146 bishops now in China, about a third are affiliated with the underground church. 
A source close to the Vatican based in Hong Kong said that there would be a tightening of religious freedoms following a restructuring of China's religious affairs authority this year, to bring it directly under party, rather than state control.
A Chinese government statement explaining the move said it would help China ""steadfastly persevere in the direction of Sinicizing our country's religions"".
This week, Guo Xijin, a bishop in the southeastern province of Fujian was detained by authorities for refusing to officiate Easter services with an official bishop. Guo, who is reportedly one of two Chinese bishops the Vatican has asked to retire or accept demotion to make way for a Beijing-backed one, couldn't be reached by Reuters for comment.
Some critics and Chinese Catholics say rapprochement between Beijing and the Vatican could drive an even deeper wedge between the faithful in China, and engender some bitterness toward the Vatican. 
TORN LOYALTIES AND FACTIONS
Those divisions are evident in places like Jiangxi province, where there are factions even within the underground Church.
When the province's then 92-year-old Vatican-appointed bishop, Thomas Zeng Jingmu, retired in 2012, one faction, led by a relative, split from another underground faction loyal to the Vatican's appointed successor, Bishop John Peng Weizhao.
The faction loyal to Peng, which now has at least six priests leading underground Masses, is likely to remain opposed to any deal and lead to the erosion of the Vatican's authority, according to a source with close ties to underground Catholics in Jiangxi's three dioceses.
She said that some devout Catholics across China were prepared to cut ties with the Vatican over a deal. ""If they're abandoned by the Vatican they'll pray to God themselves at home,"" said the source who declined to be named given the sensitivity of the matter.
""The Vatican has done the calculations and they feel it doesn't matter if they abandon the underground, because they are a relatively small group, and will sooner or later fade away.""
Peng, who was detained by authorities for six months in 2014, couldn't be reached for comment.
Archbishop Paul Gallagher, the Vatican's equivalent of a foreign minister, said at a conference on Chinese Catholicism in Rome, that while the faithful in China had experienced ""great suffering"" in the past, the country was seeking to regain a central position in the world and so efforts should be made to forge Catholicism with ""Chinese forms"".
    
RELIGIOUS SPIN
While some dioceses in coastal Fujian and in inland Hebei have large clusters of underground Catholics, Jiangxi's are less influential. Many in the area, including 62-year-old Liu Ande, have switched to the official Church.
""We are sons and daughters of God but for our country, we must listen to the leaders here,"" Liu said after a Sunday Mass at the official Catholic church in Yingtan.
The church is a shabby building in need of paint wedged into a residential courtyard with several cracked windows, where 48 mostly elderly Catholics listened to a sermon by Father Pan.
After Mass, on the steps of the church, some of the tensions of the impending deal were laid bare. 
Liu asked Pan to verify if the Vatican had asked another Bishop in southern China besides Guo, to step down.
""Is it true? We've heard it's true? It should be true,"" said Liu. ""Everyone is opposed to this.""
But Pan, the official priest, now dressed in a blue fleece jacket after mass, disputed the standoff. 
""Whether it's true or not isn't clear,"" he told Liu, who began nodding. ""There's a lot of news on the internet.""
Another worshipper dressed in a pink coat, who would only give her surname as Li, said she would be praying for a better tomorrow.

""If you've done bad things, you must then try to do lots of good things,"" she said. ""There shouldn't be tensions,"" she added. ""We are all just trying to save our own souls.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Two of Mexico's four presidential hopefuls began their campaigns on Friday, as the country looks set to reject the party that has governed for most of the past century over corruption scandals and favor a leftist dissenter.
Opinion polls ahead of the July 1 election show Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador with a large lead, with the mainstream opposition challenger second and the ruling party candidate far behind. 
Second-place Ricardo Anaya, running for the right-left coalition ""For Mexico in Front"", launched his campaign at just after midnight on Friday, holding a hackathon for 1,000 youths working on solutions to combat corruption and violence.
""Mexico is going to change,"" Anaya told the crowd of cheering young people. ""This corrupt government has its days numbered.""
Monica Vargas, a 22-year old literature student from the central state of Tlaxcala said she was supporting Anaya because he was listening to young people. She said many of her schoolmates had dropped out of college due to lack of funds. 
""As a Mexican I feel very disappointed ... we realize how rich our public officials have become, and we the people are always lagging behind,"" Vargas said.
Former first lady Margarita Zavala, who is in fourth place in the polls, also kicked off her campaign as an independent on Friday in Mexico City. 
Mexico saw a record number of killings last year as organized crime gangs smuggled drugs, fuel and people while corruption scandals hit the credibility of President Enrique Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). 
The centrist PRI has ruled Mexico continuously since 1929, except for a 12-year break when Vicente Fox and his successor led the National Action Party (PAN) to power in 2000 and 2006.
Variously described as a left-winger, a populist and a nationalist, Lopez Obrador quit the PRI in the 1980s and his subsequent political career included a stint as mayor of Mexico City, one of the world's largest metropolises. 
In second place is former PAN chief Anaya, who has pitched himself as a modern alternative to the unpopular PRI and to Lopez Obrador's personalized leadership.
The campaign of PRI candidate Jose Antonio Meade, who is not a member of the PRI, admits political parties are deeply mistrusted but says he is best placed to capture the mood.
For many voters, July 1 will be about rejecting either the corruption of the ruling party, or Lopez Obrador, said PAN Senator Ernesto Ruffo.

""This is an election not for, but against,"" he said.

LASHKAR GAH, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Last week, the Afghan air force dropped its first laser-guided missile on a Taliban compound in Farah, the western Afghan province that has seen increasing fighting since the beginning of the year.
The strike was an important milestone for the air force that underlined the growing importance of Farah, where hundreds of Taliban fighters have appeared since U.S.-backed Afghan forces stepped up operations in neighboring Helmand province.
Over the past month, Taliban fighters have delivered a series of blows to government forces, helped, according to officials in the area, by neighboring Iran, which shares a long, porous border with the province.
In one recent week, 180 soldiers and police were killed and hundreds wounded, according to a senior security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said weekly death tolls for security forces in the province could reach as high as 250.
The provincial governor stepped down in January blaming political interference and civilians say the situation has become worse.
""We don't know the reason for the escalation of violence but I can say people are very scared and people in the city haven't slept in peace for months because of the fighting,"" said Abdullah, a shopkeeper in Farah city who said he now struggles to pay the rent on his shop.
""There are many people in the same situation. Thousands of young people are jobless, they either join the Taliban or cross the border to Iran to find a living.""
The problem underlines broader challenges facing the Kabul government and its U.S. allies, which last year announced a strategy to force the Taliban to the negotiating table through a mix of air strikes and stepped-up assistance to Afghan forces.
This month, Afghan forces, backed by U.S. air power and close assistance from U.S. advisers, began a fresh operation dubbed Maiwand 12, to hit the Taliban in the insurgency hotspots of Marjah and Nad Ali districts of Helmand province.
As operations have increased in Helmand, Western officials acknowledge that the pressure has pushed militants to Farah. 
'LOWERING OF AMBITION'
But they say the insurgent focus on areas far from former battlegrounds where they had threatened the government show the problems they are facing. 
""Taliban offensives in these remote areas represent a significant lowering of ambition after their failure to take any provincial capitals in 2017,"" U.S. Navy Captain Tom Gresback, spokesman for the NATO-led Resolute Support coalition, said in an emailed statement.
U.S. aircraft recently began bombing ""drug factories"" in opium-rich Helmand, but local leaders and officials in Kabul say the Taliban will fight hard to avoid losing control of smuggling routes, which bring in millions of dollars for the insurgency.
""There are hundreds of fighters who move back and forth between Farah and Helmand,"" the Afghan security official said.
""There is a route for smuggling opium and heroin from Helmand to Farah and finally Iran and the Taliban and the smugglers will always fight to protect. It is tens of millions of dollars.""
The U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Robert Bass, told the BBC this month that Iran was providing logistical support to the Taliban, an accusation rejected by Tehran.
Iran has always denied interfering in Afghanistan but Afghan officials say it has multiple interests as well as its general hostility to the United States. 
They say it fears dams in Farah could slow the flow of water into Iran and has suspicions about a planned Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan–India (TAPI) gas pipeline.
""There is only one reason behind this: Iran's interference which provides the insurgents weapons and tries to hamper the TAPI project,"" said provincial council member Dadullah Qaneh.

They said the attack occurred in the area of a military base in the Eruh district of Siirt and that those killed were from a village guard militia which supports the Turkish military. The sources initially said five soldiers were killed.
It was not clear when the attack occurred. State-run Anadolu news agency said four soldiers and three village guards were also wounded in the attack, which occurred in an area where road construction work was being carried out.
The PKK is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Conflict in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey generally escalates as spring arrives in the mountainous region.
More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict between the Turkish state and the PKK, which launched a separatist insurgency in 1984. The conflict intensified after a ceasefire collapsed in 2015.

An Israeli military spokesman confirmed the incident. ""Overnight two suspects approached the security fence and began operating suspiciously and the tank fired toward them,"" the spokesman said.
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are planning to begin a six-week tent city protest to demand Palestinian refugees be allowed to return to what is now Israel. They have erected dozens of tents at five locations along the border. 
The Gaza health ministry spokesman said the farmer was killed and another was wounded near the town of Khan Younis. Residents there said he was gathering crops to sell later.
""Omar Samour, 27, was martyred and another citizen was wounded as a result of (Israeli) targeting of farmers east of Qarara village,"" the health ministry said.
The military spokesman said Israeli troops had also fired toward two other men at another location along the Gaza border when they approached the fence trying to ""interfere with security infrastructure"" but he did not elaborate. One of the two was hit, he said. Gaza sources initially had no details.
Israeli security forces are on heightened alert and Israel's military chief said in an interview on Wednesday more than 100 sharpshooters had been deployed on the Gaza border ahead of the planned mass demonstration near the frontier.
The Israeli military, citing security concerns, enforces a ""no go"" zone for Palestinians on land in Gaza adjacent to Israel's border fence.
Heavy earth-moving vehicles have built up dirt mounds on the Israeli side of the border and barbed wire has been placed as an additional obstacle against any mass attempt to breach the border into Israeli territory.
Organizers from a number of factions, including Islamist Hamas, which dominates Gaza, hope thousands will answer their call to flock to tent cities in five locations along the sensitive border to call for a right of return of Palestinian refugees to what is now Israel.
The March 30 date for the start of the protest marks ""Land Day"" commemorating the six Arab citizens of Israel who were killed by Israeli security forces during demonstrations in 1976 over government land confiscations in northern Israel. 

It is due to end on May 15, the day Palestinians call the ""Nakba"" or ""catastrophe"", marking the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the conflict surrounding the creation of Israel in 1948.

Gao was arrested in August 2016 at his own grocery store following a DNA test stemming from an unrelated crime committed by one of his relatives, state TV said, ending a 28-year search.

""It's our understanding that the exercises will be of a similar scale to past years. In order to make North Korea respond properly, they play an important role,"" Japan's Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera said at a regular news briefing.
The one-month Foal Eagle field exercise is scheduled to begin on Sunday, with the computer-simulated Key Resolve drill to be held for two weeks starting in mid-April. Around 24,000 U.S. troops and 300,000 South Korean personnel will take part in the exercises, according to the Pentagon.
The resumption of the joint training comes after Seoul and Washington said in January they would delay the exercises because of the Winter Olympics held in South Korea in February.

The bus was carrying 47 workers who had just crossed the border into Thailand to work legally. Three other people on the bus were injured but the rest escaped unharmed, police said.
""The driver said he saw fire breaking out from the middle of the bus, which then spread quickly,"" Kritkanok Dan-udom, the chief of Maetor district police station, told Reuters. 
Pictures in Thai media showed the burnt-out shell of the bus.
Thailand's roads have been ranked as the deadliest in the world after Libya's, according to the World Health Organization's most recent study.

Thailand is estimated to have more than 3 million migrant workers, many of whom come from much poorer neighbor Myanmar. Work permit rules were tightened last year.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexicans tired of graft and chaotic violence look set to reject the party that has governed the country for most of the past century, embracing a global anti-establishment mood by favoring a leftist dissenter in a presidential election.
Campaigning formally starts on Friday for the July 1 election and major opinion polls show Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador with a large lead, with the mainstream opposition challenger second and the ruling party candidate far behind. 
Mexico suffered its worst murder toll on record last year as organized crime ran rampant smuggling drugs, fuel and people, while corruption scandals battered the credibility of President Enrique Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). 
Those issues rather than the economy are topping Mexicans' concerns going into the campaign, but the outcome could mark a shift away from decades of gradual economic liberalization. 
While Lopez Obrador now embraces the North American Free Trade Agreement and has softened his opposition to existing private investment in the energy sector, he has flagged a more cautious approach to further opening up the economy.
His popularity has been fanned by U.S. President Donald Trump's tough policies on trade and immigration and insults that have angered Mexicans. His government could seek to row back bilateral cooperation that has gathered pace under Pena Nieto.
""The people want a change, that's why our adversaries are getting really nervous,"" Lopez Obrador said last week.
The centrist PRI has ruled Mexico continuously since 1929, except for a 12-year break when Vicente Fox and his successor led the National Action Party (PAN) to power in 2000 and 2006. 
Both the PAN and the PRI favored opening the economy to more foreign investment and close ties with the United States.
DEEP-ROOTED CORRUPTION
Variously described as a left-winger, a populist and a nationalist, Lopez Obrador quit the PRI in the 1980s and his subsequent political career included a stint as mayor of Mexico City, one of the world's largest metropolises. He has been in permanent opposition since first running for president in 2006.
He says only he can clean up deep-rooted corruption in the traditional parties. At the same time, he promises to change the constitution if he wins to end immunity for sitting presidents and hold regular referendums on key issues, including one every two years on whether he should continue his six-year term.
""We Mexicans are now seeing there are definitely two alternatives before us,"" Tatiana Clouthier, a senior member of the Lopez Obrador campaign said on Thursday: more of the same, or a government that will spread the wealth more widely.
In second place is former PAN chief Ricardo Anaya, whose coalition includes center-left parties once allied to Lopez Obrador. He has pitched himself as a modern alternative to the unpopular PRI and to Lopez Obrador's personalized leadership.
For many voters, July 1 will be about rejecting either the corruption of the ruling party, or Lopez Obrador, said Ernesto Ruffo, a PAN senator who in 1989 became the first politician to wrest control of a state government from the PRI.
""This is an election not for, but against,"" he said.
Only Anaya, said Ruffo, offered a vision of the future.
The campaign of PRI candidate Jose Antonio Meade, who is not a member of the PRI, admits political parties are deeply mistrusted but says Meade is best placed to capture the mood.
Meade says Lopez Obrador's jabs at the private sector, much of which the 64-year-old has excoriated as corrupt, will damage investment sentiment. 

""When there's investment there are jobs,"" Meade told Mexican radio on Thursday. ""When there are jobs we fight poverty.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department granted a visa to a man in Iran hoping to donate bone marrow to his U.S. citizen brother with blood cancer, obtaining a rare waiver to President Donald Trump's travel ban, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Mahsa Khanbabai, a lawyer based in Massachusetts, said she received a call on Thursday from the consulate in Yerevan, Armenia where Kamiar Hashemi had applied for a visa in February after he learned he was a rare 100 percent match for a transplant that could potentially save his brother's life.
The status of the visa application was ""refused"" on the Department's website but Khanbabai said she was told on the call that a waiver had been granted, two days after Reuters first reported on the case, and that Hashemi should make arrangements to travel to Armenia to pick it up.
The State Department through a spokeswoman said it was unable to comment on a specific visa case.
Trump's travel ban, which the U.S. Supreme Court allowed to go into effect on Dec. 8 after months of legal wrangling, puts permanent bars on most travelers to the United States from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea, as well as certain government officials from Venezuela. Although the ban allows for case-by-case waivers to be granted, attorneys and applicants say the process is opaque with few clear guidelines on how to apply and why waivers are, or are not, granted. 
Since the ban took effect, the State Department told Reuters more than 375 waivers have been approved, but declined to say for which countries and out of how many applications. 

""It's unfortunate that so much effort had to go into getting just one, clearly urgent, visa approved,"" said Khanbabai. ""There are thousands of people are stuck, also with urgent cases, with no idea what is happening.""

212,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 05:31PM ET</span>","Eye on the presidency, Mexico leftist mixes hardball and softball","By Dave Graham
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Faced with tough questions last week from six journalists on live television, Mexican presidential front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador leaned back in his chair with a twinkle in his eye, laughing off criticism, at times making fun of himself.
On the street the next day, the leftist's tone changed when he castigated Mexico's business elite, accusing them of corruption in the $13 billion construction of a new Mexico City airport he threatens to scrap if elected.
The peremptory dismissal of the bosses jarred with the more moderate image Lopez Obrador has cultivated to build a strong lead ahead of the July 1 vote.
The outburst deflected attention from his opponents' woes and undermined the vision of a smiling, avuncular patriot he has sought to project. Adversaries jumped on the opportunity to paint an old portrait of him as a short-tempered radical and divisive nationalist who cannot be trusted with the economy.
A Lopez Obrador victory could usher in a Mexican government less accommodating toward the United States, where president Donald Trump has stoked trade tensions with Mexico and aggressively moved to curb immigration.
Lopez Obrador has backed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but his plan to review newly issued oil contracts sparked worries he will deter foreign investment.
Critics and supporters alike say the 64-year-old has stuck to his principles in the dozen years he has spent pursuing the presidency. Meanwhile, his main rivals have entered government and exhausted their political capital. Voters are angry about corruption, gang violence and chronic inequality.
The presidential campaign formally gets underway on Friday. As he runs for a third time, the odds have never looked so favorable for Lopez Obrador, who cheerily brushes off warnings that his criticism of business will alarm investors.
""They want to frighten you,"" he said in a video post last week. ""But it won't work. People don't want corruption, they're sick of a few people bent on ripping off the country.""
Most polls give a double-digit lead to the baseball fan, who wore a cap and t-shirt in a video post on Wednesday, and pitched a ball to applause and laughter after pledging to send a ""curve ball"" to Trump.
Lopez Obrador says his country must reduce its dependence on foreign influence. Trump's threats to make Mexico pay for a border wall and to tear up NAFTA have played into his hands.
'RADICAL BASE'
Often referred to by his initials as AMLO, Lopez Obrador has traversed the length and breadth of the country almost non-stop since he launched his first presidential bid in 2005.
After narrowly losing to conservative Felipe Calderon in the 2006 election, he claimed the election was stolen and brought much of Mexico City to a standstill with massive street protests, declaring ""to hell with your institutions.""
The protests damaged his popularity, but he continued to blast Calderon's National Action Party (PAN), then the centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) of his successor Enrique Pena Nieto, as abettors of corruption and social unrest.
A string of graft scandals and drug cartel violence under the PRI have helped his message resonate. By 2015 some senior officials were saying privately the election was AMLO's to lose.
Since then, he has alternated between seeking to lure support away from rival parties and playing to his leftist base with attacks on the airport and the government's opening of the oil and gas industry.
""The main thing that he has to deal with is his base. He's very much like Donald Trump in that way,"" said Jorge Castaneda, co-campaign manager of Lopez Obrador's closest rival, 39-year-old Ricardo Anaya, who heads a right-left coalition.
""Which is why those people in Mexico who think he will become a moderate or a reasonable person are misunderstanding one: how radical his base is. And two: how careful he is never to lose touch with his base.""
No longer so openly contemptuous of Mexico's frail institutions, Lopez Obrador has expanded that base by courting support from social conservatives opposed to same-sex marriage, drug legalization and abortion.
He soon modified his hard line on the airport, proposing that a group of experts analyze the project, which the government says would cost $6.6 billion to cancel.
Tatiana Clouthier, a campaign coordinator who joined Lopez Obrador after long ties with the PAN, said this showed political maturity and a move toward the center.
""The great transformations in the world come via a pendulum between extremes,"" she said.
Lopez Obrador has been vague on contentious issues, saying he will consult the public. When journalists on Milenio television pressed for specifics on drug policy last week, he smiled and demurred.

""In politics it's not black and white,"" he said. ""There are times when you have to be nuanced.""

ROME (Reuters) - Pope Francis washed and kissed the feet of 12 prison inmates, including two Muslims and a Buddhist, in a Holy Thursday ritual and said the death penalty should be abolished because it is neither Christian nor humane.
For the sixth year running, the pope held the ritual in an institution rather than in the splendors of the Vatican or a Rome basilica, as his predecessors did. Conservatives have criticized him for including women and non-Christians in the rite in the past. 
He visited Rome's Regina Coeli (Queen of Heaven) jail in the center of city, to perform the rite recalling Jesus' gesture of humility toward his 12 apostles on the night before he died.
The 12 male inmates were from Italy, the Philippines, Morocco, Moldavia, Colombia and Sierra Leone. Eight were Catholic, two were Muslim, one was an Orthodox Christian and one a Buddhist.
Francis wove the sermon of a Mass around the theme of service, saying many wars could have been avoided in history if more leaders had considered themselves servants of the people rather than commanders.
He spoke of the death penalty just before leaving the prison, a former 17th century Catholic convent that was transformed into a jail 1881.
""A punishment that is not open to hope is not Christian and not humane,"" he said in response to closing comments by the prison director, a woman.
""Each punishment has to be open to the horizon of hope and so the death penalty is neither Christian nor humane,"" he said.
Since his election in 2013, Francis has several times called for an worldwide ban on capital punishment, prompting criticism from Church conservatives, particularly in the United States.
The 1.2 billion-member Catholic Church allowed the death penalty in extreme cases for centuries, but the position began to change under the late Pope John Paul, who died in 2005.
Francis has asked that the Church's new position on the death penalty be better reflected in its universal catechism.

On Good Friday, Francis is due to lead a Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession at Rome’s Colosseum. On Saturday night he leads a Easter vigil service and on Easter Sunday he delivers his twice-yearly “Urbi et Orbi” (to the city and the world) message.

SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Conservative Christian singer Fabricio Alvarado Munoz is in a tight race with his center-left ruling party rival ahead of a run-off on Sunday to decide Costa Rica's presidential election, their campaigns driven by dueling views on gay rights.Alvarado Munoz, a 43-year-old former television host, shot to the top of the polls in January soon after denouncing a ruling by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights that month which called for the legalization of same-sex marriage. 
He went on to win the first round ahead of ruling party candidate Carlos Alvarado Quesada, 38, a former minister also known for writing fiction and his student rock band.
""This division, this war that has played out in different ways ... has hit the country hard and the country doesn't want it,"" said Alvarado Munoz during the campaign's final debate last week, emphasizing his support for traditional family values.
""Your homophobic positions are what have divided the country,"" Alvarado Quesada countered at the same forum in which both candidates sought to break out of what some polls show is a dead heat.
Other surveys give Alvarado Munoz, an ex-congressman with the tiny evangelical National Restoration party, a solid lead. However, polls have a patchy record in Costa Rica and most misread the 2014 election.
Alvarado Quesada, who is no relation of his opponent, served in the cabinet of President Luis Guillermo Solis of the Citizens' Action Party (PAC).
The fight over whether gays and lesbians should be able to marry has overshadowed other pressing issues like a growing budget deficit seen limiting funding for public safety and social programs while crime is rising.
The election is seen as a barometer for the mood in Latin America, where countries that passed laws favoring same-sex unions in recent years hold presidential elections over coming months. 
Costa Rica, one of the region's more prosperous and stable countries, was ruled by a two-party dynasty until 2014 when first-time candidate Solis rode an anti-corruption wave to power.
The unraveling of the old order raises the possibility that a significant number of Costa Rica's 3.3 million voters will decide at the last minute.
""The absence of party identification leads to a couple of very unusual conditions: lots of voters who are undecided plus an unprecedented volatility in voter preferences,"" said Ronald Alfaro, a pollster at the University of Costa Rica.
TWO COSTA RICAS
The bitter race has laid bare divisions between urban professionals who want political leaders to embrace modernity, and an older, more rural society that favors traditional ways.
Alvarado Munoz has pledged to fight what he calls the ""secular state"" and ""gender ideology,"" to eliminate sex education in schools and maintain strict restrictions on women's access to abortion.
He says he would stiffen penalties for corruption and unleash an ""iron fist"" against crime, but has said less about budget priorities or anti-poverty measures.
""This is the biggest fundamentalist threat that Costa Rica has ever faced,"" said Julia Ruiz, a 36 year-old accountant, while she and her girlfriends tried on dresses inspired by ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" a web TV series based on the anti-totalitarian novel by Canadian author Margaret Atwood.
The women plan to wear the dresses as a protest against Alvarado Munoz's socially conservative agenda.
Alvarado Quesada faces his own detractors, especially those fed up with the unpopular outgoing government.

The candidate has sought to dodge accusations of corruption plaguing the Solis administration by launching a plan to halve the budget deficit, while providing social assistance to the country's poor and protecting minority rights.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia expelled 60 U.S. diplomats on Thursday and announced it would eject scores from other countries that have joined London and Washington in censuring Moscow over the poisoning of a spy.
The U.S. ambassador was also ordered to shut the consulate in St Petersburg, in Russia's retaliation for the biggest expulsion of diplomats since the Cold War.
The White House said Moscow's decision marked a further deterioration in the U.S.-Russia relationship.
""Russia's response was not unanticipated and the United States will deal with it,"" the White House said in a statement without elaborating. 
The expulsions precisely mirrored steps taken by Western governments against Russian diplomats and appeared to show Russia was not seeking to escalate the standoff over the nerve agent poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury, England, on March 4.
The State Department, however, indicated earlier that the United States could retaliate for Russia's ""regrettable, unwarranted action,"" raising the possibility that the crisis could intensify.
""We reserve the right to respond further. We're reviewing our options,"" said State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, who charged that the attack on the Skripals violated an international chemical weapons ban. She declined to discuss what additional measures the Trump administration could take.
Britain has blamed Russia for the poisoning, and has been backed up by dozens of Western countries which have ordered Russian diplomats to leave. The United States charges that the 60 Russians that it targeted are intelligence officers operating under diplomatic cover.
""The United States, in concert with many countries, made the decision to kick out Russian spies,"" said Nauert. ""We don't see this as a diplomatic tit-for-tat.""
Moscow denies involvement in the attack on the Skripals.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, facing a stuttering economy and an unusual show of Western unity that included even states traditionally friendly towards Moscow, appeared to have stuck to the diplomatic playbook with the symmetrical response.
Ambassador Jon Hunstman was summoned to the Russian Foreign Ministry, a gothic skyscraper built under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, and told that 60 diplomats from U.S. missions had a week to leave Russia, as Washington had expelled 60 Russians.
At a meeting with Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, Huntsman was also told that the U.S. consulate in St Petersburg would be closed -- a like-for-like retaliation for the U.S. closure of Russia's consulate in the U.S. city of Seattle.
""As for the other countries, everything will also be symmetrical in terms of the number of people from their diplomatic missions who will be leaving Russia, and for now that's pretty much it,"" said Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
That approach will mean that, among other countries affected, France, Germany and Poland would each have four of their diplomats in Moscow sent home, Ukraine would forfeit 13 diplomats, and Denmark, Albania and Spain would each have two of their embassy staff expelled.
Russia has already retaliated in kind after Britain initially expelled 23 diplomats.
DAUGHTER BETTER
Skripal, 66, a double agent who was swapped in a spy exchange deal in 2010 and went to live in England, and his daughter Yulia Skripal, 33, were found unconscious on a public bench in a shopping centre in Salisbury on March 4.
Former Russian military intelligence officer Skripal remains in a critical condition but his daughter is getting better, the hospital where they are being treated said on Thursday.
British authorities say a Soviet-era nerve toxin called Novichok was used in an attempt to murder the pair. 
British Prime Minister Theresa May said that Russia was culpable for the attack and urged allies to join in condemning Moscow for the first known offensive use of a chemical weapon on European soil since World War Two. 
Russia says Britain has failed to produce any persuasive evidence of Russia's guilt. Officials in Moscow accused London and Washington of pressuring other nations to sign up to an international campaign of ""Russophobia"" which, they said, could drag the world into a new Cold War.
Announcing the expulsions of Western diplomats on Thursday, Lavrov said the Skripal poisoning was being exploited by an ""Anglo-Saxon axis forcing everyone to follow an anti-Russian path.""
British counter-terrorism police said they believed the military-grade nerve agent that poisoned the Skripals had been left on the front door of Sergei Skripal's home, on a quiet street in Salisbury, southern England. 
""Specialists have identified the highest concentration of the nerve agent, to date, as being on the front door of the address,"" Scotland Yard said in a statement.
Police said they had placed a cordon around a children’s play area near the Skripals' house as a precaution.
Christine Blanshard, Medical Director for Salisbury District Hospital, where the two victims are being treated, said in a statement that Yulia Skripal's condition had improved after three week in a critical condition.

""She has responded well to treatment but continues to receive expert clinical care 24 hours a day,"" said Blanshard.

LONDON (Reuters) - The daughter of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal is getting better after spending three weeks in critical condition due to a nerve toxin attack at his home in England, the hospital where she is being treated said on Thursday.
After the first known use of a military-grade nerve agent on European soil since World War Two, Britain blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for the attempted murder, and the West has expelled around 130 Russian diplomats.
Russia has denied using Novichok, a nerve agent first developed by the Soviet military, to attack Skripal. Moscow has said it suspects the British secret services are trying to frame Russia to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.
British counter-terrorism police said they now believe Skripal and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia were poisoned with a nerve toxin that had been left on the front door of their home in the genteel English cathedral city of Salisbury.
“I’m pleased to be able to report an improvement in the condition of Yulia Skripal,"" Christine Blanshard, Medical Director for Salisbury District Hospital, said in a statement.
""She has responded well to treatment but continues to receive expert clinical care 24 hours a day,"" she said.
Her father remained in a critical but stable condition, the hospital said. Last week, a British judge said the Skripals might have suffered permanent brain damage as a result of the attack. 
Police said on Thursday they had placed a cordon around a children’s play area near the Skripal's modest house as a precaution. 
Yulia and her 66-year-old father were found slumped on a bench outside a shopping center in Salisbury on March 4.
Britain has blamed the attempted murder on Russia, and expelled 23 Russians it said were spies working under diplomatic cover in retaliation. 
Russia, which denies carrying out the attack, responded by throwing out 23 British diplomats. Moscow has since accused the British secret services of trying to frame Russia to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.
""ENOUGH IS ENOUGH""
The attack on Skripal, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who betrayed dozens of Russian agents to Britain's MI6 spy service, has plunged Moscow's relations with the West to a new post-Cold War low.
British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said late on Wednesday the Kremlin had underestimated the Western response to the attack, which also injured a British policeman.
Johnson told an audience of ambassadors in London that 27 countries had now moved to expel Russian diplomats over Moscow's suspected involvement.
""These expulsions represent a moment when a feeling has suddenly crystallized, when years of vexation and provocation have worn the collective patience to breaking point, and when across the world – across three continents – there are countries who are willing to say enough is enough,"" Johnson said.
Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for Russia's Foreign Ministry, told reporters in Moscow on Thursday Britain was breaking international law by refusing to provide information on Yulia Skripal despite the fact she was a Russian citizen.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was watching closely a media report that Britain might limit London's role in marketing Russian debt to investors.
Skripal, recruited by British spies while in Spain, ended up in Britain after a Cold War-style spy swap that brought 10 Russian spies captured in the United States back to Moscow in exchange for those accused by Moscow of spying for the West.
His house, which featured a good-luck horseshoe on the front door, was bought for 260,000 pounds ($360,000) in 2011. Skripal was listed as living there under his own name. 
Since emerging from the world of high espionage and betrayal, he has lived modestly in the cathedral city of Salisbury and kept out of the spotlight until he and his daughter were found unconscious on March 4.
In the years since he found refuge in Britain, he lost both a wife and son.
The attack on Skripal has been likened to the killing of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko in Britain. Litvinenko, a critic of Putin, died in London in 2006 after drinking green tea laced with radioactive polonium 210. 
Russia denied any involvement in that killing. 

An inquiry led by senior British judge Robert Owen found that former KGB bodyguard Andrei Lugovoy and another Russian, Dmitry Kovtun, carried out the murder of Litvinenko as part of an operation probably directed by Russia’s Federal Security Service.

TRESHCHEVSKY, Russia (Reuters) - Stuffed toys, flowers and bowls of sweets: these were just some of the offerings brought to a Siberian school by village residents mourning the death of six schoolgirls killed in a fire that claimed 64 lives in the city of Kemerovo on Sunday. 
The fifth-year classmates had been on a school trip to watch a film at the Winter Cherry shopping mall in Kemerovo, 30 kilometers (20 miles) away, when a fire broke out, sweeping through the upper floors and the top floor cinema.  
They were among 41 children killed in the blaze, deaths that have shattered the rural calm of Treshchevsky, a small village in the coal-producing region of Kemerovo where school staff members said they were in shock. 
“Until the very last, we all held out hope that the children would have managed to escape,” said Pavel Orlinsky, the head of the school, who described the girls as very lively and active participants in school life.
The schoolgirls had been accompanied by a teacher and two fathers who stepped away for a walk as the girls sat in the cinema. When the fire broke out and they tried to return to the children, they were not allowed up from the ground floor, Galina Stepanova, the school cook, said. 
""This isn’t a big village,"" said Vladimir Yevdokimov, head of the local Osinogrivsky rural settlement. “These girls were visible everywhere, they went to school, they were in school clubs, they spoke to everyone. That’s why of course for us this brings us big grief.”
The fire has focused attention on lax health and safety standards and stirred public anger over corruption, sentiment echoed by some residents in Treshchevsky. 
“Corruption is to blame for this, that’s all that I want to say,” said Maxim, a workman sitting on his haunches outside his workshop. “Innocent people suffer and we see this happening for many years. Everything is covered in corruption.""
The portraits of the six schoolgirls had been hung in a school hall in tribute.

“Just last Saturday I set tables for them, I saw them,” said Stepanova, the school cook. “If we had known that we wouldn’t see them again after Sunday and that all this would happen, who would have let them go?”

MONTREAL (Reuters) - The United Nations' aviation agency is trying to facilitate talks between Qatar and its neighbors to defuse recent tensions over alleged airspace violations, but won't intervene politically in the dispute, two sources familiar with the matter said this week.
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is working to organize a regional meeting for Gulf civil aviation and air traffic authorities in the next few weeks, as part of broader efforts to improve communication, one of the sources said.
Earlier this week, the United Arab Emirates accused Qatari fighter jets of flying dangerously close to two of its civilian aircraft in Bahraini airspace, in the latest of several incidents raising tension in the region. 
""Sometimes if you're having a feud with your neighbor you need someone to facilitate the conversation,"" the source said. ""I would hope that Qatar will express its needs in a way that's workable.""
Montreal-based ICAO cannot impose binding rules on governments, but wields clout through its safety and security standards which are approved by its 191-member countries.
ICAO spokesman Anthony Philbin said by email that the agency is ""presently monitoring these incidents and working with all of the countries concerned to help keep the skies in this part of the world open, safe, and secure for international operations."" 
The council, however, is not planning to intervene in these latest disputes over airspace infringement, said the second source.
Improving communication is key because Qatar has limited airspace and is part of Bahrain's Flight Information Region, the first source said.
Both aviation industry sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential. Bahraini, Qatari, and UAE officials could not be reached for comment.
Since January, the Gulf states have traded accusations over infringements of their respective airspace. In June 2017, the UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Egypt launched a blockade against Qatar, accusing it of supporting Islamist extremists. Qatar has denied the accusations. 
ICAO last year helped Qatar Airways access contingency routes over international waters, after the country's neighbors refused to allow the carrier to use their airspace.
In June, ICAO's governing council is expected to hear arguments by the Gulf states over the blockade, which Qatar is challenging, said the second source.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican on Thursday rebuked a well-known Italian journalist who quoted Pope Francis as saying hell does not exist.
The Vatican issued a statement after the comments spread on social media, saying they did not properly reflect what the pope had said.
Eugenio Scalfari, 93, an avowed atheist who has struck up an intellectual friendship with Francis, met the pope recently and wrote up a long story that included a question-and-answer section at the end.
The Vatican said the pope did not grant him an interview and the article ""was the fruit of his reconstruction"" not a ""faithful transcription of the Holy Father's words"".
Scalfari, the founder of Italy's La Repubblica newspaper, has prided himself on not taking notes and not using tape recorders during his encounters with leaders and later reconstructing the meetings to create lengthy articles.
According to Scalfari's article in Thursday's La Repubblica, he asked the pope where ""bad souls"" go and where they are punished. Scalfari quoted the pope as saying:
""They are not punished. Those who repent obtain God's forgiveness and take their place among the ranks of those who contemplate him, but those who do not repent and cannot be forgiven disappear. A Hell doesn't exist, the disappearance of sinning souls exists.""
The universal catechism of the Catholic Church says ""The teaching of the Catholic Church affirms the existence of hell and its eternity."" It speaks of ""eternal fire"" and adds that ""the chief punishment of hell is eternal separation from God"".

It was at least the third time the Vatican has issued statements distancing itself from Scalfari's articles about the pope, including one in 2014 in which the journalist said the pontiff had abolished sin.

SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria, which has a strong pro-Russian lobby in government, needs more time to decide whether to follow NATO and EU allies in expelling Russian diplomats over a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy, its deputy prime minister said on Thursday.
EU presidency chair Bulgaria has recalled its ambassador from Moscow after the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England in the first known use of a military-grade nerve agent on European soil since World War Two.
But it has stopped short of following most EU members and allies in NATO, including the United States, which have expelled dozens of Russian diplomats in a show of solidarity with Britain over the March 4 attack. 
""The political situation in Bulgaria is such that these types of decisions have to be taken by consensus,"" deputy prime minister Tomislav Donchev said, referring to a strong body of opinion in the coalition government and opposition which favours pursuing good ties with Russia.
""At the moment, for good or bad, there is no such consensus,"" he said. 
Bulgaria, which was liberated from Ottoman rule by Russia, became one of the most obedient Soviet satellite states during the Cold War. Many Bulgarians feel a strong cultural affinity for Russia, with which they share the Cyrillic script and orthodox Christianity. 
This legacy translates into a coalition government in which the centre-right GERB party shares power with three smaller nationalist parties which to varying degrees support better ties with Russia and argue that Bulgaria should take a balanced position over the Skripal case.
They have opposed a call by a senior GERB official for Bulgaria to follow the lead of its allies and expel Russian diplomats.
Both President Rumen Radev and the biggest opposition party, the Socialists, are also insisting that more concrete proof is needed of Russian involvement in the Skripal poisoning.
The government's Security Council was to discuss the attack on Friday and the coalition partners themselves were due to meet to discuss possible next measures in the affair.
""I categorically think these (calls for Bulgaria to expel Russian diplomats) are a mistake,"" said Volen Siderov, leader of the pro-Russian, nationalist Attack party, one of GERB's junior coalition partners. 
""We have one unclear case. We have no evidence of Russia's participation,"" he said in a statement. 
Donchev, in an interview with Reuters, said any action undertaken by Bulgaria would be seen as a signal of solidarity with Britain and its allies and also as a signal to Russia.
Speaking of the internal situation, he said: ""Taking into account that our government is a coalition one ... I am not convinced that such a decision can be taken so easily and so quickly.""
Donchev said Bulgaria would wait for a report from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for the time being, saying that Sofia was monitoring developments closely.
""What happened in Great Britain is ... unacceptable. It is barbaric, it is a chemical weapon, it is a military toxic substance,"" Donchev said. 

Referring to Bulgaria's history of close ties with Russia, Donchev said: ""This is an undeniable fact. History, though, is sometimes a good, and sometimes a bad, teacher in politics.""

221,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>",German general sees closer missile defense ties with Dutch,"By Andrea Shalal
COLOGNE, Germany (Reuters) - Germany and the Netherlands could deepen missile defense ties in the coming years to strengthen NATO defenses, a German general told Reuters, at a time of growing tensions with Russia.
Defense ministers from both countries will emphasize the growing importance of their military ties at a Dutch base on April 4, when a German short-range air defense unit is formally put under Dutch command.
Brigadier General Michael Gschossmann, commander of ground-based units for the German air force, said the move was ""politically significant"" and could pave the way for joint development of new weapons and joint operation of existing long-range missile defense systems such as the Patriot system.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has said perceived U.S. isolationism under President Donald Trump and the threat posed by Russia as well as instability in Africa and the Middle East mean Germany and Europe must be more active in regional security.
Germany and the Netherlands are also among a number of European Union states which have expelled Russian diplomats over Moscow's suspected involvement in the poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in England.
The German and Dutch militaries have already knitted together some land forces and naval elements, and train together on missile defense, in what could be a model for deeper security cooperation in Europe in the future.
""We are now working with the Dutch to integrate our smaller systems, and suggest that cooperation could be expanded to include larger weapons systems in the longer term,"" Gschossmann said in an interview. ""If there's a political will to move ahead, it could happen relatively quickly.""
The moves are being watched by U.S. and European arms makers keen to secure orders as Western powers beef up their defenses against missiles and other threats including drones. 
A spokesman for German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen declined comment on the scope of future German-Dutch projects. A Dutch defense ministry spokeswoman said the two countries were looking at possible joint procurement programs, but had not yet reached any decisions.
ECONOMY OF EFFORT
Since World War Two, Britain and France have been Europe's top military powers. However, Germany has come under increased pressure since Trump's election to meet NATO's defense spending target, set at two percent of member states' annual economic output.
The new coalition government says it intends to meet Germany's NATO commitments, but its agreement does not explicitly mention reaching the spending target by 2024.
Gschossmann said working together on new capabilities made sense given tight budgets and the fact that both countries needed to buy new short-range air defense missiles and radar systems, including a replacement for Stinger shoulder-launched missiles that will go out of service in the mid-2020s.
Germany is close to completing requirements for a new very-short and short-range air defense system that could be worth around 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in the near-term, according to government sources. 
The Defense Ministry is expected to launch a competition this summer with the goal of awarding a contract in mid-2019, Gschossmann said. 
Potential bidders include Diehl Defense, a privately held German weapons maker, whose IRIS-T missile has been modified with a dual-cab tracked vehicle built by a unit of BAE Systems (LON:BAES) for Sweden.
France's Thales systems, would also be likely to compete for the order, industry sources said.
Germany aims to have six brigades ready for deployment by 2032, which would require close to 20 air-defense fire units to protect them, Gschossmann said. 
Joint work by the Germans and the Dutch could even extend to the United States in the future, Gschossmann said, noting that the U.S. military was also seeking to rebuild its short-range air defenses after years of cuts.
In the longer term, Germany and the Netherlands could jointly operate longer-range missile defense systems such as the Patriot system built by U.S. arms maker Raytheon Co, Gschossmann said.
That system is due to remain in use in Germany until at least 2030, he said, although Germany is also negotiating a contract for a follow-on system with  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and European missiles maker MBDA

The ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front coalition on Tuesday voted in the 42-year-old, a retired lieutenant general from Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, the Oromo, to take over the government.
Ethiopia is Africa's second most populous country and has had the fastest growing economy on the continent for the past decade, but protests that began in 2015 have caused the biggest threat to the EPRDF since it took power in 1991. 
""The House of People's Representatives will hold an extraordinary session on April 2 to swear in Dr. Abiye Ahmed,"" the body said in a statement.
His predecessor Hailemariam, from the small Wollayta ethnic group, resigned last month after sustained protests in the Oromiya and Ahmara regions where people say they are politically and economically marginalized.
Abiye will now face pressure to appeal to legions of disaffected youth and to push through promised reforms.

The event was initially scheduled for Saturday. The statement did not give a reason for the postponement.

VALENCIA, Venezuela (Reuters) - Anguished relatives of some 68 people killed in a riot and fire in the cells of a Venezuelan police station demanded explanations on Thursday while rights groups and opposition politicians blamed leftist President Nicolas Maduro for overcrowding in the country's notoriously violent jails.
Deadly riots are common in Venezuela's lawless prisons, where inmates often openly wield machine guns and use drugs. But the death toll in the decrepit city of Valencia, once a thriving industrial hub, in Wednesday's riot was particularly shocking.
In Geneva, the United Nations human rights office called on authorities to carry out a speedy investigation and to provide reparations to victims’ families.
“We urge the Venezuelan authorities to carry out a prompt, thorough and effective investigation to establish the cause of these deaths, provide reparations to the victims’ families, and, where applicable, identify and bring those responsible to justice,” the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement voicing concern at prison conditions.
Opposition politicians in Venezuela said the disaster was another sign of Maduro's incompetent rule in a country that is deep in economic crisis and is plagued with food shortages, hyperinflation, and rampant crime. 
Although prison violence has been a problem in Venezuela for decades, opposition lawmakers say it has worsened under Maduro and his predecessor the late Hugo Chavez.

""The only culprit is the government, which keeps a huge quantity of prisoners crammed together in police office cells for a long time in inhumane conditions,"" said opposition lawmaker Yajaira Forero.

Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous part of Azerbaijan, is run by ethnic Armenians who declared independence during a conflict that broke out as the Soviet Union crumbled in 1991.
Though a ceasefire was agreed in 1994, Azerbaijan and Armenia still regularly accuse each other of carrying out attacks in the area. The conflict flared up again in 2016 and saw a number of deadly incidents over the past year.

225,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 10:32AM ET</span>",More than 25 million people apply for Indian railway vacancies,"By Neha Dasgupta
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - More than 25 million people, a number greater than Australia's population, have applied for about 90,000 positions on India's state-run railways, underlining the challenge Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces in providing millions of jobs ahead of an election in 2019.
Modi was voted into power in 2014 on promises to reignite growth in Asia's third-largest economy and provide jobs. But his flagship ""Make in India"" initiative to lift the share of manufacturing in India's $2 trillion economy to 25 percent from about 17 percent and create 100 million jobs by 2022 has so far failed to deliver on its promise.
The railway, which currently employs 1.3 million people, said it was filling up tens of thousands of vacant positions for engine drivers, technicians, carpenters, track inspection crews and other roles related to improving safety in the world's fourth-largest network. 
""We've not been recruiting for the last couple of years and attrition is already there. And so we require people,"" Ashwani Lohani, chairman of the railways board, told Reuters.
The Railway Recruitment Board advertised for the positions last month and since then 25 million people have filed online applications from around the country, Lohani said. The closing date is Saturday.
The recruitment drive would be the largest conducted by a state-run organization since Modi took office four years ago, struggling to find jobs for an estimated 1 million young people that enter the labor force each month.
""The huge number of applications shows the level of stress,"" said Mahesh Vyas, chief executive officer at economic think-tank CMIE.
""It shows that there is really a paucity of jobs, and the other thing is about the great preference that Indians have got for government jobs. We need to move away from this.""
The railways are India's biggest employer and are in the midst of a $130 billion modernization plan.
Applicants will take a written test available in 15 languages, according to the ad. There is also a physical fitness test and different criteria for men and women have been specified. 
Lohani said it would be a logistical challenge sifting through 25 million candidates but the railway was equipped to handle it. ""We had to come out with an open advertisement, that is the only way to do it,"" he said.
India's unemployment rate surged to a 15-month high of 6.1 percent in February, think-tank CMIE said.
Even after the railway has completed the recruitment, the challenge will be how to train the new workers, which is critical for safety, another expert said. 

""When you take 90,000 people in one shot, you don't have the training facilities,"" said Pronab Sen, country director for the UK-based International Growth Centre, which is focused on economic policies.

226,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 12:54PM ET</span>",France's Sarkozy to face trial for influence peddling,"By Emmanuel Jarry
PARIS (Reuters) - Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was ordered on Thursday to stand trial for influence peddling over accusations he offered to help a prosecutor get promoted in return for leaked information about a separate criminal inquiry.
Sarkozy, who is embroiled in several criminal investigations, denies any wrongdoing and has vowed to have all cases dismissed. His lawyers said they would appeal Thursday's decision to try him.
""Nicolas Sarkozy will ... calmly wait for the result of the motion for a declaration of invalidity. He does not doubt that once again the truth will triumph,"" his lawyers said in a statement. His appeal will be heard on June 25, it said. 
The case came about after investigators used phone-taps to examine separate allegations that late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi funded Sarkozy's campaign. The investigators began to suspect the former president had kept tabs on a separate case through a network of informants.
Thursday's development came just over a week after Sarkozy, 63, was told he was being formally treated as a suspect in the election campaign investigation. 
Sarkozy was president from 2007 to 2012 but was defeated by Socialist Francois Hollande when he ran for re-election. He has since faced a series of investigations into alleged corruption, fraud, favoritism and campaign-funding irregularities.
Under French law, a suspect is not formally charged with a crime unless he is sent to trial.
Sarkozy’s lawyers had previously argued that magistrates investigating the alleged secret Libyan funding exceeded their powers and went on a “fishing expedition” by tapping his conversations between September 2013 and March 2014, breaching lawyer-client privilege.
He used the mobile phone account under the alias “Paul Bismuth” only for calls with lawyer Thierry Herzog.
INFLUENCE PEDDLING
Based on the intercepts, Sarkozy, who still had political influence at the time despite having left office, is accused of having discussed offering a promotion to a prosecutor in return for tip-offs on another campaign funding probe.
That investigation, into accusations that Sarkozy's former party treasurer Eric Woerth and others exploited the mental frailty of France’s richest woman, Liliane Bettencourt, to extract political donations, was dropped without charges.
A source close to the investigation said that along with Sarkozy, Herzog, and the prosecutor would also face trial on the same charges.
Influence-peddling can be punished in France by up to five years in prison and a fine of 500,000 euros ($682,000). Sarkozy lost presidential immunity from legal prosecution a month after he left office in June 2012.
Sarkozy, who was called ""president bling bling"" by many due to his flashy style, has been dogged for years by accusations of wrongdoing, but none has led to a conviction. He is challenging an earlier order to stand trial on charges of illicit spending overruns during his failed 2012 campaign.
After being put under investigation over the Libya probe, Sarkozy went on prime time television to reject those accusations, which he said were making his life ""hell"".
Sarkozy and his Republicans party have repeatedly called investigations into him politically motivated.
""All this energy wasted on ridiculous matters at a time when all our legal means should be dedicated to fighting terrorism,"" Olivier Marleix, Republicans lawmaker and long-time supporter of Sarkozy, told Reuters. 
One of the many factors that played in 40-year-old Emmanuel Macron's presidential election win in May 2017 was a promise of a clean break with traditional French politics, often marred by accusations of corruption. 

Sarkozy’s predecessor, Jacques Chirac, was convicted in 2011, after his retirement, of misusing public funds to keep political allies in phantom jobs. That made the now ailing Chirac the first French head of state convicted since Nazi collaborator Marshal Philippe Petain in 1945.

QASR AL-YAHUD, West Bank (Reuters) - On the western bank of the River Jordan, not far from the spot where Christians believe Jesus was baptized, experts have begun clearing thousands of mines from the ruins of eight churches and surrounding land deserted more than 50 years ago. 
Once the anti-tank mines and other explosives are removed, the compounds containing a Roman Catholic church and seven Eastern Orthodox churches abandoned after the 1967 Middle East war can be re-opened, said HALO Trust, a Scottish-based charity organizing the endeavor.
The mined area, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, is about a kilometer (half-mile) from Qasr al-Yahud, the baptism site which HALO said was visited by around 570,000 Christian pilgrims last year.
A team of Israeli, Palestinian and Georgian experts, using hand-held mine detectors and armored mechanical diggers, began clearing the church compounds and the surrounding desert shrubland shortly before the Christian Holy Week that precedes Easter.
Rusting barbed wire fences, with signs warning ""Danger Mines!"" in Hebrew, English and Arabic, run along a dusty road leading to the 100-hectare (27 acre) area. HALO says the land contains around 2,600 mines and an unknown number of other unexploded ordnance.
Some of the churches may be boobytrapped, the charity says.
In a safe zone at the riverside on Thursday, a family from Spain wearing white baptismal robes stepped into the water.
HALO has been raising funds for the project over several years and said in a statement it intends to complete work at the site by Christmas.
It described the project as a rare example of multi-faith collaboration in the Middle East, involving Israel and the Palestinian Authority that administers limited self-rule in the West Bank.
The river area was once a war zone between Israel and Jordan. The two neighbors made peace in 1994 but it took many years before some mine clearing began.
Both claim that the site where John the Baptist and Jesus met is on their side of the biblical river. The Gospel of John refers to “Bethany beyond the Jordan” without further details.
In 2002, Jordan opened its site, showing remains of ancient churches and writings of pilgrims down the centuries to bolster its claim. UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site in 2015.
Israel opened the baptism area on the western bank of the river in 2011. It has a modern visitor center and stairs for pilgrims to descend into the muddy water.
HALO, which has cleared landmines all over the world and was once sponsored by the late Princess Diana, said on Thursday that three of their staff members were killed and two injured by the accidental detonation of an anti-tank mine in Nagorno Karabakh.
The group were in a vehicle conducting a minefield survey when the explosion occurred in the separatist region in Azerbaijan.

SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - For a regime obsessed with secrecy, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's decision to travel to Beijing on a distinctive green armored train was an all-but-dead giveaway that he was making his first journey abroad since assuming power in 2011.
The historic visit sent officials scrambling to obscure the identity of the 21-car train and its occupants as it meandered across roughly 1,100 km (680 miles) of track through northeast China, causing rare delays along the way and triggering a growing frenzy of speculation as it neared the Chinese capital.
The train arrived at Beijing Station on Monday afternoon and left the following afternoon, with the identity of its occupants only announced on Wednesday morning - after it had crossed back into North Korea at the city of Sinuiju. 
Clues that something unusual was afoot emerged in the border city of Dandong, just across the Yalu River from North Korea and linked to the isolated country by the Sino-Korea Friendship Bridge. That bridge bears a single rail track which, it turned out, carried Kim's train into China late on Sunday.
The Daily NK, a Seoul-based website staffed by North Korean defectors, reported that boards supported by scaffolding had been set up on the platform at Dandong's train station, blocking what is ordinarily an open view, before two trains passed through the station between 10:20 and 10:40 p.m. on Sunday night.
Yao Jun, who sells car parts in Dandong, said the station was locked down again on Tuesday night, an unusual occurrence. Kim returned to North Korea in the early hours of Wednesday.
""Now we know for next time - if the train station is in lockdown then that means Kim Jong Un has come to China,"" Yao told Reuters.
At least one Dandong hotel was told by Chinese authorities not to book rooms facing the bridge, while tours from China into the North were canceled on Sunday, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. A local resident said that a wedding party along the river on Sunday had been told not to set off firecrackers.
By Monday morning sighting rumors and pictures were making the rounds on Chinese social media, before being blocked or deleted by censors, while railway bureaus began warning travelers to expect delays or cancellations on Monday and Tuesday.
The disruptions were noteworthy in a country with a vast rail network that prides itself on its efficiency, with 98.8 percent of trains departing on time in 2016 and 95.4 percent arriving on schedule, and prompted complaints online.
Zhao Jian, a professor at Beijing Jiaotong University who researches the country's railway system, said Kim's train traveled on the regular track network, rather than on the tracks used by the country's high-speed trains.
""Passenger and freight traffic would have been affected,"" he said. 
A person answering the official phone line at Dandong station on Thursday stressed that everything had been ""normal"" this week, and asked, ""who told you the station was closed?"" 
An official in the international cooperation department of the China Railway Corporation declined immediate comment on Kim's visit.
MANCHURIA AND THE GREAT WALL    
China has not disclosed the route taken by Kim in the train - green with a yellow stripe resembling one used by his late father, Kim Jong Il, on his last visit to China in 2011.
Based on photos from the elder Kim's visit, the only visible difference between the two trains was a license plate. The younger Kim's license plate showed DF0002; the plate on the train used by his father displayed DF0001. 
North Korean state media showed Kim and his entourage, including his wife Ri Sol Ju, seated on stuffed pink sofas inside the train carriage with Song Tao, the head of the Chinese Communist Party's international affairs department, during their inbound stop in Dandong. 
There are at least two likely rail routes between Dandong and Beijing, and an ordinary service takes at least 14 hours, according to Chinese railway timetables. The route is also covered by China's high-speed trains, which travel on separate tracks, in just over six hours. 
But social media posts made by local railway bureaus and ordinary users on social media suggest a surge in delays around the route from Dandong that heads north to Shenyang, in the region previously known as Manchuria. The route then snakes west along the Hebei province coast towards Beijing.
On Monday morning, Weibo users at rail stations in Tangshan and Tianjin began complaining of unexpected cancellations to regular services bound for Beijing, which they said were made without explanation. 
In a Weibo post published at 5:14 p.m. on Monday and since deleted, the Beijing Railway Bureau told travelers waiting at stations in Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang to expect delays of up to two hours for trains from Shenyang and Qinhuangdao. 
On Tuesday evening, a Twitter user with the handle ""2018you333"" posted a grainy video of a train with a single horizontal stripe hurtling across an empty car underpass, which the user said was taken at the Shanhai Pass area, 300 km east of Beijing and a major pass in the Great Wall of China.
""Let's guess where this distinguished guest is coming from!"", the post said.

Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the video.

PASULJANSKE LIVADE, Serbia (Reuters) - Under the keen eye of President Aleksandar Vucic and foreign diplomats, Serbia's military flexed its muscles on Thursday, firing live ordnance in a mock attack on insurgent positions at a training ground east of Belgrade. 
The training drill, dubbed Synergy 2018, came three days after Kosovo police used force to scatter Serb protesters in the town of Kosovska Mitrovica in Kosovo's restive North and briefly detained a Serbian government official.
The incident soured already tense ties between Serbia and Kosovo, its former southern province which declared independence in 2008 after a bloody war a decade earlier. 
Army commander Gen. Ljubisa Dikovic said the exercise, involving more than 900 troops, was a part of training plans for 2018. 
""We have always had good soldiers, we want to have more of them ... we want them to be even better trained,"" Vucic told reporters at the Pasuljanske Livade training range. 
Serbia's military budget in 2018 stood at 70.5 billion dinars (595 million euros), 23.6 percent more than last year. 
Its forces are largely using Soviet technology from the 1980s and Belgrade wants to modernize its kit. Some of the weapons used in the drill were obsolete but still functional. 
""We pulled them from depots, refurbished ... and as you could see, they worked well,"" Vucic said. 
Serbia is a European Union candidate country but one of the few Balkan states not in the 29-member NATO alliance, which is hugely unpopular among Serbs since its 1999 bombing campaign to drive Serbian forces out of Kosovo. Alliance peacekeepers are still deployed there. 
In 2006 Serbia, which has adopted military neutrality, joined NATO’s Partnership for Peace program and in 2015 signed the Individual Partnership Action Plan - the highest rung of cooperation between the alliance and a country not aspiring to join.
Serbia also fosters close military ties with Russia, its traditional Orthodox Christian and Slavic ally.

Russia and the rebel faction controlling Douma, the last Ghouta town still in insurgent hands, said they were still negotiating over the fate of the town. Moscow said it saw a chance of the remaining insurgents quitting Douma.
Thousands of fighters have accepted Russian-brokered deals to leave other parts of the enclave in the past week with their families on government-supplied buses, giving them safe passage to other insurgent-held areas. Tens of thousands of other civilians have stayed behind to accept state rule, and tens of thousands more have fled across the frontline.
The collapse of rebel control in eastern Ghouta, after one of the fiercest campaigns of the seven year war, has delivered the insurgents their worst defeat since they were driven out of Aleppo in 2016.
At a weekly briefing, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said the ""counter-terrorist operation"" in eastern Ghouta had nearly finished, according to RIA state news agency.
Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov said there could be progress in talks with fighters from the Jaish al-Islam group, which holds Douma, RIA said.
Eastern Ghouta, an early centre of the 2011 uprising against President Bashar al-Assad, was until last month the biggest and most populous remaining rebel stronghold near the capital.
Its capture will cap a string of battlefield victories for the government of President Bashar al-Assad since Russia sent its air force to join his war effort against the rebellion in September 2015, making his position unassailable. 
A commander in the alliance supporting Assad, which besides Russia includes Iran and Shi'ite militias from Lebanon and Iraq, said on Wednesday negotiations with Jaish al-Islam had stopped. 
However, Jaish al-Islam official Mohammad Alloush, based outside Syria, told Reuters by text message on Thursday that talks were continuing, ""despite reports of threats and provocations in order to put pressure on civilians"".
SHELTERS
Despite some artillery fire on Douma on Wednesday, there has been no renewal of the army's withering bombardment and assault that stormed most of the rebel enclave in just a few weeks. 
It split eastern Ghouta into three parts, and the factions in two of the zones agreed surrender terms a week ago, including the choice of accepting Assad's rule or leaving with light weapons for opposition territory in northwestern Syria. 
Daily convoys of buses have since made the 320km (200 miles) journey to Idlib carrying about 7,500 fighters and their families, 30,000 people in all, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor. 
About 134,000 other people fled across front lines from rebel territory in eastern Ghouta into areas held by the government, the Observatory said. Some 40,000 people remained in the towns it has recaptured so far. 
On Thursday, the United Nations resident and humanitarian coordinator's office in Syria said in an emailed update that 75,000 civilians had been received in shelters and 47,000 civilians remained in them. It described conditions in the shelters - mostly unfinished buildings, hangars or schools - as ""dire"". 
Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu told the U.N. Syria envoy that displaced people could begin returning to eastern Ghouta in a few days, RIA said.
Assad and his allies say their offensive was needed to end the rule of Islamist militants over civilians and to stop rebel mortar fire on Damascus, which state television says has killed dozens in recent weeks. The Observatory says the government assault has killed more than 1,600 people. 
Western countries and rights groups have accused the Syrian military of targeting civilian infrastructure and repeatedly using indiscriminate weapons including helicopter-dropped barrel bombs, chlorine gas and fire-setting incendiary munitions. 

The Syrian and Russian governments deny all that and have accused the rebel groups of fabricating evidence of such attacks and of killing people who tried to flee their territory, which the insurgents deny.

Chairman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who holds a 95 percent stake, waived his share of proposed dividends worth 299.2 million riyals quarterly ($79.8 million), it added in a bourse filing.
Alwaleed will still receive 562.7 million riyals in dividend for the year, a company official told Reuters.
""This is consistent with what he has received over the past seven years when the company started giving dividends. What he is giving up is 299.2 million riyals per quarter,"" the official added.
Prince Alwaleed, the kingdom's most recognized business figure, was freed on Jan. 27 after being held at Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel for three months on the orders of his cousin Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
He said in a television interview last week that he had reached an agreement with the government for his release, but declined to disclose the details. He added that he was looking for investments up to $3 billion.
Alwaleed, a nephew of Saudi King Salman, is closely watched in international markets because of investments in companies such as  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp (O:NWSA).
Kingdom Holding announced earlier on Thursday a net profit of 663.6 million riyals versus a loss of 350 million riyals a year ago on an increase in income from investments.

A statement followed reports in China quoting a bishop backed by the Beijing government as saying that a long-awaited deal would be signed by the end of March. 
A senior Vatican source said earlier on Thursday that the Vatican still did not know precisely when a Chinese delegation was due to come to Rome.
The details of a framework accord, which eventually could lead to diplomatic relations between the Holy See and Beijing, were worked out when a Vatican delegation visited China late last year.
Full relations would give the Church a legal framework to look after all of China’s estimated 12 million Catholics and move on to focus on Catholic growth in a country where Protestant churches are already growing fast.
Catholics in China are split between those in ""underground"" communities that recognize the pope and those belonging to a state-controlled Catholic Patriotic Association where bishops are appointed by the government in collaboration with local Church communities. Under the formal deal, the Vatican will have a say in negotiations for the appointment of future bishops.
Some Catholic leaders outside China, particularly Cardinal Joseph Zen, 86, the outspoken former bishop of Hong Kong, has been highly critical of the accord, saying the Vatican would be ""selling out"" to China's Communist Party.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's political parties met on Thursday to try to find common ground on forming a government in the wake of this month's inconclusive election, ahead of formal consultations with the president next week.
The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which won most votes at the March 4 election, organized meetings in parliament with the far-right League, its more moderate ally Forza Italia (Go Italy!) and the left-wing Free and Equal party.
The 5-Star's Senate leader Danilo Toninelli said the talks had been ""constructive"" and had focused on policies that could win broad support in parliament, such as measures to combat poverty, rather than on government posts. 
Forza Italia's representative Anna Maria Bernini also said the meeting had been ""useful"", but beyond the cautiously positive tones there are major obstacles in the way of forming a ruling coalition.
The 5-Star and the League each claim the right to name the prime minister and lead a government -- the former as the largest single party and the latter as the leading party in a conservative coalition that won most parliamentary seats.
After their leaders, 5-Star's Luigi Di Maio and the League's Matteo Salvini, joined forces to elect the speakers of the two houses of parliament last week many commentators saw the deal as paving the way to a 5-Star/League government.
However this solution, which would alarm Brussels and investors because of both parties' hostility to EU budget rules, now looks threatened by mutual vetoes.
INTRANSIGENCE
The first involves the leadership: Salvini said this week it is not vital that he should be prime minister, but Di Maio is less flexible. He said on Tuesday that it was the ""people's will"" that he should get the job because 5-Star, with 33 percent of the vote, got twice the support of the League, on 17 percent.
Salvini criticized Di Maio's intransigence and has said the prime minister should come from the center-right.
Another stumbling block is the role of Forza Italia and its leader, four-times prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.
5-Star, which bases its appeal on a vow to clean up politics, is fiercely hostile to Berlusconi, who has a conviction for tax fraud and is on trial in another case for allegedly bribing witnesses.
Di Maio refuses to meet Berlusconi and some 5-Star lawmakers have said they would find it unacceptable to be in government alongside ministers from Forza Italia. However, Salvini says he will not abandon his coalition partners to form a government just alongside 5-Star.
Salvini acknowledged the difficulties in an interview with daily Corriere della Sera on Wednesday, saying he saw a 50 percent chance that no deal would be found and that fresh elections would need to be called within the next few months. 
President Sergio Mattarella will try to resolve this impasse in talks with the various parliamentary parties on April 4 and 5, his office said on Thursday. 

He will see the rightist parties individually, rather than as a single group. If no obvious solution is found, he is likely to hold a second round of consultations later in the month and it might take many weeks before any firm decisions are made.

Catholics in China are split between ""underground"" communities that recognize the pope and those belonging to the Catholic Patriotic Association where bishops are appointed by the government in collaboration with Church communities.
A senior Vatican source told Reuters last month a framework accord was ready and could be signed in months. It could open the way for a resumption of diplomatic relations nearly 70 years after they were cut during the Communist takeover of China.
Full relations would give the Catholic church a legal framework to look after all of China's estimated 12 million Catholics and allow it to focus on growth in a country where Protestant churches are already growing fast.
Negotiations have reached ""the final stages,"" Bishop Guo Jincai, secretary-general of the government-run Bishops Conference of the Catholic Church in China, said, according to the state-run Global Times in a report late on Wednesday. 
The deal is expected to address the issue of bishop appointments ""as well as issues of shared concern for Beijing and the Holy See such as promoting world peace"", he said. 
""Misunderstandings that arose from media speculation and lack of communication between the two sides were being solved in ongoing talks,"" the newspaper added, citing Guo.
""If everything goes right, the deal could be signed as early as the end of this month,"" he said. ""The timing depends on details of the deal or technical issues.""
Another issue that will have to be resolved is self-ruled Taiwan, which maintains formal diplomatic ties with the Vatican. China considers Taiwan a wayward province with no right to state-to-state relations.
Taiwan's foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday it was paying close attention to developments.
Taiwan hoped that the Vatican could continue to work with it to ensure the protection of the universal values of religious freedom, humanitarianism and peace on the basis of their friendship, the ministry added.
Chinese authorities have detained an ""underground"" bishop who is being asked to take a subordinate role in the church as part of the landmark deal between the Vatican and China, two sources said on Wednesday.

239,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 08:22AM ET</span>",Dalai Lama faces cold shoulder as India looks to improve China ties,"By Sanjeev Miglani
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, faces increasing isolation in his home in exile as India tones down an assertive stand toward its powerful neighbor and rival, China, in the hope of calming ties strained by a border stand-off.
The Asian giants were locked in a 73-day military face off in a remote, high-altitude stretch of their disputed border last year, with, at one point, soldiers from the two sides throwing punches and stones at each other.
The confrontation between the nuclear-armed powers in the Himalayas underscored Indian alarm at China's expanding security and economic links in South Asia.
China's ambitious Belt and Road initiative of transport and energy links bypasses India, apart from a corner of the disputed Kashmir region, also claimed by Pakistan, but involves India's neighbors Sri Lanka, Nepal and the Maldives.
Now Prime Minister Narendra Modi's nationalist government, is reversing course, apparently after realizing its hard line on China was not working, and the Dalai Lama is facing the cold shoulder.
""We are moving forward with this relationship, the idea is to put the events of 2017 behind us,"" an Indian government source involved in China policy said. 
The idea is to ""be sensitive"" to each other's core concerns and not let differences turn into disputes, the source said. 
The Dalai Lama has lived mostly in the north Indian town of Dharamsala since 1959, when he fled a Chinese crackdown on an uprising in his homeland.
In Dharamsala, his supporters run a small government in exile and campaign for autonomy for Tibet by peaceful means. India has allowed him to pursue his religious activities in the country and to travel abroad.
Early this month, India issued an unprecedented ban on Tibetans holding a rally with the Dalai Lama in New Delhi to mark the 60th anniversary of the start of the failed uprising against Chinese rule.
'DEEPLY RESPECTED'
This week, the Dalai Lama canceled a visit to the Indian border state of Sikkim this week, hosted by authorities there, officials say, lest it offended China. 
Sikkim is south of the Doklam plateau where the hundreds of Indian and Chinese soldiers confronted each other last year after India objected to China's construction of a road in an area claimed by India's tiny ally, Bhutan.
Even ""thank you"" rallies by Tibetans planned for New Delhi to show appreciation to India for hosting the Dalai Lama and his followers have been shifted to Dharamsala.
India's foreign ministry said the government had not changed its position on the Dalai Lama. 
""He is a revered religious leader and is deeply respected by the people of India. His Holiness is accorded all freedom to carry out his religious activities in India,"" spokesman Raveesh Kumar said.
But India's recent attitude is in stark contrast with his former treatment.
In 2016, the Dalai Lama was invited to India's presidential palace for a ceremony honoring Nobel Peace prize winners. The government later allowed him to visit the disputed state of Arunachal Pradesh, disregarding Chinese objections.
China reviles the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist and his activities in India have always been a source of friction, and a tool with which India can needle China.
""Tibet has utility to irritate China, but it is becoming costly for us now. They are punishing us,"" said P. Stobdan, a former Indian ambassador.
China has blocked India's membership of a nuclear cartel and it also blocks U.N. sanctions against a Pakistan-based militant leader blamed for attacks on India.
'UNDERSTANDING AND RESPECT'
The Tibetan government-in-exile has been phlegmatic, expressing understanding of the shifting circumstances and gratitude to India for hosting the Dalai Lama for 60 years.
""The Indian government has its reasons why, these coming months are sensitive, and we completely understand and respect that so there's no disappointment at all,"" Lobsang Sangay, the head of the government in exile told reporters.
China has hailed better ties.
""Everyone can see that recently, due to the efforts of both sides, China-India relations have maintained positive momentum and development, and exchanges and cooperation in all areas have achieved new progress,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Thursday.
Lu said China was willing to work with India to maintain exchanges on all levels and to increase mutual political trust and ""appropriately control differences"".
A flurry of visits is planned.
Next week, India National Security Adviser Ajit Doval is heading to China and Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj is due to visit in April.
Modi will visit in June for a regional conference and talks with President Xi Jinping.

The two sides are also expected to revive ""hand-in-hand"" counter-terrorism exercises when India's defense minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, visits China in April, a defense source said. The drills were suspended earlier.

240,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 10:37AM ET</span>",Rights lawyer Amal Clooney to represent Reuters reporters held in Myanmar,"YANGON (Reuters) - Prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney has joined the legal team representing two Reuters reporters jailed in Myanmar, who are accused of possessing secret government papers, her office said on Thursday.
A court in Yangon has been holding preliminary hearings since January to decide whether Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, will be charged under the colonial-era Officials Secrets Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.
The journalists had been working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men in western Myanmar's Rakhine state during an army crackdown that began in August, which has sent nearly 700,000 people fleeing to Bangladesh.
Lawyers for the two reporters on Wednesday asked the court to throw out the case, saying there was insufficient evidence to support charges against the pair.
""Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are being prosecuted simply because they reported the news. I have reviewed the case file and it is clear beyond doubt that the two journalists are innocent and should be released immediately,"" Amal Clooney was quoted as saying in a statement released by her office.
""The outcome of this case will tell us a lot about Myanmar's commitment to the rule of law and freedom of speech,"" said Clooney, who is married to actor George Clooney.
Zaw Htay, spokesman for Myanmar's civilian government, declined to comment. 
Government officials have previously denied the arrests represent an attack on press freedom, which rights advocates say is under growing threat in the Southeast Asian country.
Myanmar's ambassador to the United Nations, Hau Do Suan, said last month that the Reuters journalists were not arrested for reporting a story, but were accused of ""illegally possessing confidential government documents"".
Gail Gove, chief counsel of Reuters, said retaining Clooney would strengthen the company's international legal expertise and broaden efforts to secure the release of the reporters.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have been in custody since their arrest on Dec. 12. 
The pair have told relatives they were arrested almost immediately after being handed some rolled up papers at a restaurant in northern Yangon by two policemen they had not met before, having been invited to meet the officers for dinner.

The district court in northern Yangon will hear arguments from prosecutors and defense lawyers on the motion to dismiss the case on April 4.

A police statement said raids connected with the arrests were continuing but did not say why the six Turks were taken into custody or provide further information for the time being.
Nazi Ulus, principal of one of the schools, told Reuters that one of the arrested Turks, Mustafa Erdem, was the director of all Gulen schools in Kosovo. He had no further information. 
Some Balkan countries have faced pressure from Ankara to close private schools linked with Gulen, a U.S.-based Muslim cleric accused by Ankara of orchestrating the July 15 coup attempt. He denies any connection with the would-be coup.
But Kosovo, whose population is mainly Muslim, had said it had no plans to close down Gulen schools.
Turkey is a major supporter of impoverished Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008, and Turkish firms run the tiny Balkan country's sole airport and electricity network, and are building two highways worth around $2 billion.
At its peak, the Gulen movement operated schools in 160 countries, from Afghanistan to the United States. Since Ankara declared the movement a terrorist organization two years ago, it has pressured allies to shut down Gulen-run establishments. 
In Turkey earlier on Thursday, the broadcaster CNN Turk said prosecutors ordered the detention of 70 serving army officers over alleged links to Gulen.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian prosecutors on Thursday sought a jail term of at least 16 years for former parliament speaker Setya Novanto if found guilty in a graft scandal and demanded that he also repay more than $7 million he is suspected of plundering.
The Corruption Eradication Commission, known locally as the KPK, demanded that judges presiding over Novanto's trial find him ""legally and convincingly proven guilty of jointly committing corruption"", prosecutor Abdul Basir told the court.
Novanto, who was taken into custody in November, is accused of orchestrating a scheme to plunder $173 million from a government contract to introduce a national electronic identity card - almost 40 percent of the project's entire budget.
He denies wrongdoing in a case that has shocked Indonesians already used to large corruption scandals..
Should Novanto fail to repay the $7.4 million the commission alleges he received from the scheme within a month of a court ruling, his assets should be seized and auctioned off, Basir added. If that didn't cover the alleged losses, Novanto should serve an additional three years in prison, Basir said.
Prosecutors, who have questioned 80 witnesses in the case, also demanded Novanto pay an additional 1 billion rupiah ($72,670) fine or serve an additional six months in prison.
Novanto had stayed in power through several previous corruption cases and repeatedly missed summonses for questioning by the anti-graft agency in connection with this case, saying he needed heart surgery. 

The next hearing is scheduled for April 13.

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya's conflict cannot be resolved unless the black economy and ""predation of public money"" are ended, the U.N. envoy to the country said, calling on international actors to target ""big traffickers"" with sanctions.
U.N. Special Representative Ghassan Salame is leading the latest push to reunify and stabilize Libya, seven years after the NATO-backed uprising in which Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed. 
During years of turmoil punctuated by armed conflict, a lucrative shadow economy has emerged in the oil-rich nation, based on foreign currency exchange scams, smuggling and extortion. 
""I think this is the most important issue today in Libya,"" Salame said in an interview. ""It is, at least in my modest view, the heart of the matter in Libya."" 
Salame, a Lebanese former government minister and professor who took up his post in August last year, said tackling the shadow economy required a ""determined effort"" by the United Nations, international financial institutions and foreign powers. 
He said he had been working to convince the international community that any political deal to unify rival factions based in Tripoli and eastern Libya would only be ""cosmetic"" if the shadow economy was not tackled. 
""I tried my best to persuade them that if they want a political process they have to put an end to all kinds of traffic in this country. Not only traffic of human beings, but also traffic of fuel, traffic of subsidized (goods), traffic of drugs."" 
""They need to address the black market. They also need to address the predation of public money,"" Salame said.
""It's a big challenge – I think we need to start blaming and shaming people. I think we need to look into money transfers.""
Action was also needed ""through specific sanctions against big traffickers taken by the most important economic partners of Libya"", he said.
ARMED GROUPS
Control of Libya's informal economy is often enforced through armed groups and military factions, some with official status, which have held real power on the ground since 2011.
Salame has launched a dialogue with armed groups, and has said that he hopes to unveil a strategy for dealing with them by May.
""I think this is necessarily going to be a multi-year problem, because there are a lot of them, and also because the government is not necessarily optimally equipped to integrate them into an army or into police.""
The dialogue is part of a U.N.-led ""national conference"" process that also includes town hall meetings, support for local peace deals and the empowerment of mayors, and reconciliation with exiled supporters of the Gaddafi regime. 
""One day, probably in a few weeks or months, we will bring leaders who appeared in all these sub-processes together to meet, but that would be more like the cherry on the cake than the cake itself,"" Salame said.
Salame has called for new elections by the end of the year, though he said he was ""very, very aware"" that polls could add to problems rather than solve them. Parliamentary elections in 2014 were disputed and led to rival governments being set up in Tripoli and the east.
Salame said presidential elections were ""very, very hard to think of"" without a constitution being adopted first, and that he would seek a commitment by major stakeholders to accept results. 

""I hope I have a written statement, at least to have a public one.""

Since Trump took office, Mattis has made several tours of Asia, including trips to Japan, the Philippines, Thailand, South Korea, Vietnam and Indonesia. 
His trip to South Korea in October included a stop at the heavily fortified border with North Korea amid tension over its nuclear weapon and missile program.
But Mattis did not accompany Trump on his state visit to Beijing in November. 
""As for the visit of Defense Secretary Mattis to China, defense departments in both countries are currently coordinating on this,"" Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang said when asked about the issue during a monthly news briefing.
""At the same time, other exchange program between the two countries' militaries are also being pushed forward in a smooth manner in accordance with plans,"" Ren said.
He did not elaborate.
The U.S. Embassy in Beijing said it did not have any information to release.
Japanese media cited the U.S. Pentagon in January as saying Mattis could visit China in the spring.
Ren's comments comes after Beijing last week angrily objected to a so-called freedom of navigation patrol by a U.S. warship close to one of its artificial islands in the Spratly archipelago in the South China Sea. 
Tensions have simmered between the two countries' militaries over the disputed waters.
Nonetheless, China has said that it has again been invited to attend a major U.S.-hosted naval drill this year, the Rim of the Pacific exercise.
Ren said China would send a working group to the United States early next month to discuss its participation. 
The drills, known as RIMPAC, are billed as the world's largest international maritime exercise, and are held every two years in Hawaii in June and July. China has attended previously.

Pentagon officials have long complained that China has not been candid enough about its rapid military build-up, whereas Chinese officials have accused Washington of viewing their country in suspicious, ""Cold War"" terms.

The move is the latest in increased security ties between Vietnam and the United States and follows a landmark visit by a U.S. aircraft carrier to the country in early March. 
""The bilateral partnership between the United States and Vietnam continues to reach new heights,"" the embassy said in a statement. 
Vietnam is the country most openly at odds with China over parts of the disputed South China Sea. 
China claims 90 percent of the potentially energy-rich maritime territory, but Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also lay claim to parts of it, through which about $5 trillion of trade passes each year.
Dozens of Chinese naval vessels exercised this week with an aircraft carrier in a large show of force in the area, satellite images obtained by Reuters showed.
The U.S. embassy statement said the patrol boat transfer ""demonstrates U.S. support for a strong, prosperous, and independent Vietnam that contributes to international security and the rule of law.""
More boats are due to be delivered and the United States has also provided a training center, maintenance facility, boat lift, vehicles and a navigation simulator.
The Metal Shark ""45 Defiant"" patrol boat is manufactured in the United States by Gravois Aluminium Boats LLC.
It can reach speeds of up to 50 knots (93 km per hour) and is suited for both inland and offshore use, according to the manufacturer's website.

The official said that five suspected militants also died during the gun attack late on Wednesday outside al-Mukala, the Hadramout provincial capital, against a unit of the Hadrami Elite Forces.
The unit was set up and trained by the United Arab Emirates, as part of a strategy to combat al Qaeda, which had exploited a three-year civil war and tried to expand its control in the area before they were driven out.
Hisham al-Jaberi, a local military commander, said at least four other soldiers from the Hadrami Elite Forces were also wounded in the attack in an area called Wadi Hajar.
Al Qaeda’s Yemen affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), had briefly seized control of Mukalla and several other towns and cities in the neighboring Shabwa, Abyan and al-Bayda provinces. Local forces, backed by the UAE member of the Saudi-led coalition drove them out in a series of military operations over the past two years.
But militants still operate in remote areas in southeastern Yemen, including in Abyan, Shabwa and al-Bayda.
The Saudi-led coalition, which includes the UAE, is fighting in Yemen against Iran-aligned Houthis, who seized large parts of the country in a series of operations that began in late 2014, culminating in forcing the internationally recognized President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to flee into exile in Saudi Arabia.

At a closed-door meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday, London, Paris and Berlin sought EU support for formal approval of the new sanctions in April, after proposing them in mid-March, according to a document seen by Reuters.
But Italy, with support from Spain and Austria, resisted plans to impose travel bans and asset freezes on around 15 Iranians, companies and groups, linked to Iran's ballistic missile program and role in Syria's war.
Rome said they would not be enough to persuade U.S. President Donald Trump not to withdraw from the nuclear deal and would endanger burgeoning business ties with Iran. Spain was also wary of the knock-on effects.
Under EU rules, economic sanctions need unanimous support.
""Italy said dialogue was the preferred option and that sanctions could weaken our position while not convincing the United States,"" the diplomat said. ""Spain asked the three to consider the implications of such a move.""
Trump has given the European signatories a May 12 deadline to ""fix the terrible flaws"" of the 2015 nuclear accord, agreed under his predecessor Barack Obama, or he will refuse to extend a suspension of U.S. sanctions on Iran.
Trump's choices in recent weeks of two officials publicly opposed to the Iran accord, John Bolton as national security adviser, and Mike Pompeo as secretary of state, has dramatically raised the probability of a U.S. pullout, the diplomats said.
Rome and Tehran in January signed a framework credit agreement to fund investments worth up to 5 billion euros ($6 billion) in Iran. 
""COMMANDO APPROACH""
In Brussels, other countries including Sweden were upset that the three European powers were trying to push things through the EU's diplomatic approval process so quickly.
""There was a commando approach, but it failed,"" a second EU diplomat said.
""The difference here is that everyone thinks Trump will pull out (of the Iran deal) and so some consider this pointless."" 
The three countries are in talks with the U.S. administration to see what could encourage Trump to issue new waivers on U.S. sanctions.
The 2015 pact between Iran and six major powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - lifted sanctions that had crippled Iran's oil-based economy, in return for restrictions on its nuclear activities.
The new measures proposed by London, Paris and Berlin could target members of Iran's most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), as well as commanders of the Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah.
Discussions are expected to continue in early April but at a lower level than ambassadors, to try for a compromise at EU foreign ministers' meeting in Luxembourg on April 16, the last formal gathering on the EU agenda before Trump's May deadline. 
Iran insists its nuclear work has been non-military and missile program purely defensive.

Dozens of Chinese naval vessels are exercising this week with an aircraft carrier in a large show of force off China's Hainan island in the South China Sea, satellite images obtained by Reuters show.
The images, provided by Planet Labs Inc, confirmed a Chinese carrier group had entered the important trade waterway as part of what the Chinese navy earlier described as combat drills that were part of routine annual exercises.
The Liaoning carrier group last week traversed the Taiwan Strait, according to the Taiwan defense ministry.
Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang, asked about the pictures of the ships in the South China Sea at a regular monthly news briefing, said the military was conducting routine drills in line with annual plans which were not aimed at any country.
""It's aim is to test the training capabilities of the People's Liberation Army and enhance their training capabilities. It is also aimed at improving combat abilities of the whole military,"" Ren said.
""As to the specific movements of the aircraft carrier the Liaoning, the navy will release information in due course,"" he added, without elaborating.
However, he later confirmed that the Liaoning had passed through the Taiwan Strait, in what he said was also part of normal and regular training activities, and that these drills would continue. He gave no details.

The vegan was due to go before a judge on a charge of condoning terrorism on Thursday, two days after a left-wing activist received a one-year suspended sentence for hailing the death of another victim of the same attack, gendarme Arnaud Beltrame.
Condoning terrorism carries a maximum jail sentence of five years and a fine of 75,000 euros ($92,000).
France's butchers federation said it had filed the legal complaint against the author of the Facebook post, which has been removed.
The vegan lives in Saint Gaudens, a village not far from the Pyrenees mountains and the town of Trebes, hit by last week's attack.
Moroccan-born Radouane Lakdim killed four people during his rampage, including three people in a supermarket in Trebes. Among the victims there were Beltrame and butcher Christian Medves.
President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday led a national tribute to Beltrame, who swapped places with a woman Lakdim had been holding hostage. A ceremony for the three civilians killed was held on Thursday morning. 

Lakdim was shot dead by police.

253,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 06:31AM ET</span>",Water crisis spurs protests in Iran,"By Babak Dehghanpisheh
BEIRUT (Reuters) - A number of protests have broken out in Iran since the beginning of the year over water, a growing political concern due to a drought which residents of parched areas and analysts say has been exacerbated by mismanagement.
The demonstrations have been relatively small, sporadic and limited to towns around the central city of Isfahan and Khuzestan province in the west. But they have highlighted an issue that played a role in earlier unrest and the authorities have cracked down, while recognizing the need for change.
In early March, the turnout was light in a town near Isfahan, with dozens of farmers chanting the tongue-in-cheek slogan ""Death to farmers, long live oppressors!"", according to online videos. A week later the protests became more tense.
Dozens of riot police on motorcycles faced off against farmers in the same town, Varzaneh, another video showed. Smoke swirled around the protesters and the person filming said tear gas was being fired. A second person reported clashes. Police in the city of Isfahan were not immediately available to comment.
“What’s called drought is more often the mismanagement of water,” said a journalist in Varzaneh, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject.
“And this lack of water has disrupted people's income.”
Farmers accuse local politicians of allowing water to be diverted from their areas in return for bribes.
While the nationwide protests in December and January stemmed from anger over high prices and alleged corruption, in rural areas, lack of access to water was also a major cause, analysts say.
At least 25 people were killed and, according to one parliamentarian, up to 3,700 people were arrested, the biggest challenge yet for the government of president Hassan Rouhani, who was reelected last year.
DISPLACED
In Syria, drought was one of the causes of anti-government protests which broke out in 2011 and led to civil war, making the Iranian drought particularly sensitive.
Approximately 97 percent of the country is experiencing drought to some degree, according to the Islamic Republic of Iran Meteorological Organization. Rights groups say it has driven many people from their homes.
“Towns and villages around Isfahan have been hit so hard by drought and water diversion that they have emptied out and people who lived there have moved,” said Hadi Ghaemi, the executive director for the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI), a New York-based advocacy group.
“Nobody pays any attention to them. And people close to Rouhani told me the government didn’t even know such a situation existed and there were so many grievances.”
Rouhani and Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei mentioned drought as a problem that needs to be addressed in the country during their speech last week commemorating Nowruz, the Iranian new year, while condemning ""lawlessness and violence"".
An ad running on state TV which encourages Iranian citizens to conserve water shows a man sitting in a chair in the middle of a desert with the slogan, ""Drought is closer than you think"".
A United Nations report last year noted, ""Water shortages are acute; agricultural livelihoods no longer sufficient. With few other options, many people have left, choosing uncertain futures as migrants in search of work.""
In early January, protests in the town of Qahderijan, some 10 km (6 miles) west of Isfahan, quickly turned violent as security forces opened fire on crowds, killing at least five people, according to activists. One of the dead was a farmer, CHRI said, and locals said water rights were the main grievance.
Videos posted on social media show protesters chanting outside a police station and throwing Molotov cocktails at the building, one of the most violent incidents documented during the nationwide protests.
    A journalist in Qahderijan who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue said the attack on the police station was not the right thing to do but that water mismanagement had deprived farmers of their livelihoods.
SECURITY
Hassan Kamran, a parliamentarian from Isfahan, publicly criticised energy minister Reza Ardakanian this month, accusing him of not properly implementing a water distribution law.
""The security and intelligence forces shouldn’t investigate our farmers. The water rights are theirs,"" he told a parliamentary session.
In early March, Ardakanian set up a working group comprising four ministers and two presidential deputies to deal with the crisis.
Since the January protests, Rouhani has repeatedly said the government will do what it can to address grievances. But there is no quick fix for deeply rooted environmental issues like drought, observers say. 
“These are local grievances but the solutions are with the national government,” said Tara Sepehri Far, Iran researcher for Human Rights Watch, adding that the government had limited power and widespread corruption.
Rouhani's office was not immediately available to comment.
Iranian security forces are aware of the potential for water issues to cause instability. A senior Revolutionary Guards commander, Yahya Rahim Safavi, noted in a public speech in late February that water will play a key role for both the Islamic Republic’s national and regional security.
Environmentalists have found themselves in the firing line.
In late January, Kavous Seyed-Emami, the director of the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation, and six other environmentalists were arrested.
Two weeks later, authorities said Seyed-Emami had committed suicide in jail after confessing to being a spy for the United States and Israel. His family has denied the allegation.
State TV later aired a report saying Seyed-Emami and his colleagues were telling Iran's enemies the country could no longer maintain domestic agriculture production because of a water shortage and needed to import food.
In late February, three more environmentalists were arrested and three weeks ago, Seyed-Emami’s wife was prevented from leaving Iran, according to family members.

“Public opinion has become sensitized to environmental issues,” said Saeed Leylaz, a Tehran-based economist and political analyst. “So the government may see the organizations and institutions who work on environmental issues as problematic.”

China considers self-ruled Taiwan to be a wayward province, ineligible for state-to-state relations, and has slowly managed to cut the dwindling number of countries which maintain ties with Taipei.
Last year, China established relations with Panama, which had for decades been a steadfast Taiwan ally, in a major diplomatic coup for Beijing.
Only 20 countries still recognize Taiwan, most of them poor nations in Central America, the Caribbean, Pacific and Africa.
Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said Tsai would visit the southern African nation of Swaziland from April 17 to April 21, with this year marking half a century of diplomatic ties.
The only other African ally Taiwan has left is Burkina Faso.
This will be Tsai's first trip to Africa since assuming the presidency in 2016. As president, she has also visited some of Taiwan's other friends, including Paraguay, Guatemala, Tuvalu, the Solomon Islands and the Marshall Islands.
China's hostility towards the democratic island has risen since Tsai, from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, won the presidency.
China fears she wants to push for formal independence, though Tsai says she wants to maintain the status quo and peace.
China and Taiwan have tried to poach each other's allies over the years, often dangling generous aid packages in front of developing nations, though Taipei struggles to compete with an increasingly powerful China.
Some countries have switched ties several times.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said this month it was in the best interests of Taiwan's few remaining diplomatic allies to recognize an ""irresistible trend"" and ditch Taipei in favor ""one China"" ruled by Beijing.

The Vatican is likely next on the list, as the Holy See and China edge closer to an accord on the appointment of bishops.

255,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 06:01AM ET</span>","Food, buses, and cash: Getting out the vote the Egyptian way","By Ahmed Aboulenein, Amina Ismail and Mahmoud Mourad
CAIRO (Reuters) - The going rate for a vote in Egypt's presidential election was 50 to 100 Egyptian pounds ($3 to $5), but heading down to a polling station could have also landed you a box of groceries or even half-price tickets to an amusement park.
Authorities pressed for a high turnout in a vote set to give President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi a sweeping victory in the absence of real competition. Sisi urged people to vote, hoping a large turnout will give him a strong mandate.
There is no evidence that authorities were behind vote buying or other inducements.
Reuters correspondents have witnessed multiple cases of state institutions, lawmakers, private businesses, and pro-Sisi individuals seeking to reward voters or make it seem turnout is higher than it actually was.
Diaa Rashwan, the head of the State Information Service, did not deny such cases could have taken place but said they would not affect the election results, were ""not systematic"" and would have been ""carried out by individuals and not the state"".
At the office of a logistics company in Cairo's working class Ward estate, employees collected national ID cards and informed people where they could vote. Tuk-tuks (rickshaws) then took voters there.
After casting their ballots, voters would be picked up by the same tuk-tuks and returned to the office, to receive payments of 50 pounds.
""I drive people to their polling stations, wait for them, and then take them back to collect the money,"" said one driver.
A Reuters correspondent made the journey with one voter and spoke to three others who said they took the money. All spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Islam Mostafa, 25, said he was offered 100 pounds to vote but declined.
""I will not vote, vote for who? Sisi will win anyway. This is not a real election. What will 100 pounds do anyway?""
Rashwan said offering or receiving electoral bribes carries a penalty of up to one year in prison and authorities would jail anyone caught doing either.
BAGS OF FOOD
Some women in working class Cairo neighborhoods told Reuters they were promised bags of food in exchange for voting.
One woman said a man went around her neighborhood knocking on doors and gave people slips of paper. He told them to go vote, come back with the paper which they can exchange for a bag of food items.
She declined to be identified for fear of reprisal and said she did not know the man.
A Reuters correspondent saw a man in the working class Helmeyet al-Zaytoun area of eastern Cairo gather photocopies of national ID cards from women there and give them papers with Sisi's face printed on them. 
One woman told Reuters she got the paper stamped by individuals inside a polling station as proof she had voted, before returning it to the man in exchange for box containing rice, vegetable oil, and sugar.
Civil servants and other state employees were encouraged to vote by their bosses and even private businesses got in on the action.
Dream Park, a popular Cairo amusement, offered half price tickets on election days to those who voted.
SINGING AND DANCING
At polling station in Cairo's Nasr City, guided by men in plain clothes, dozens of women and a handful of men wearing rural garments marched out of a voting station, waving Egyptian flags and then singing for 10 minutes. 
They then boarded a convoy of buses and left for 15 minutes, only to return and recreate the same scene. The ritual went on for five hours, a Reuters correspondent observed. The buses had no license plates.
The voting line never had more than 10 people at a time.
There were similar scenes in other polling stations, Reuters correspondents observed.
Rashwan said such incidents were not illegal and did not affect actual turnout figures or the election results. 
In working class Imbaba overlooking the Nile, lawmaker Ihab al-Khouly sat amongst supporters outside a group of polling stations before getting up to dance with pro-Sisi voters.
Khouly denied he was organizing buses to bring voters in when asked by Reuters but was later seen helping women on the busses himself.
Rashwan said that lawmakers providing transport for voters is not illegal and is in fact a service to their constituents.Mohamed Mahmoud, an official at the Free Egyptians Party which backs Sisi, said his party had chosen to educate voters about the importance of participation instead of resorting to such tactics.
""There is a difference between those who are working for the country and those doing things for personal gain,"" he said.

He said it was unlikely security services played any role in amassing voters.

CAIRO (Reuters) - President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi cruised toward a landslide election victory against no real opposition but early results showed a lower turnout than the vote that brought him to power in 2014, despite efforts to get more Egyptians to the polls.
The vote this week had long been set to hand Sisi a second term after a crackdown against serious contenders left one challenger, widely dismissed as a dummy candidate. Critics say the contest recalled the kind of vote that kept Arab autocrats in power for decades before the 2011 Arab Spring.
With the election seen by many, including Sisi, as a referendum on his presidency, the focus is on turnout which he has sought to support tough economic reforms and a fight against Islamist militants.
Critics say austerity and an unprecedented crackdown on dissent have eroded Sisi's popularity, but supporters say such measures are needed to stabilize the North African country after years of unrest that followed a 2011 popular uprising.
The former military commander overthrew Islamist Mohamed Mursi, Egypt's first freely-elected president, after protests against Mursi's rule in 2013 and was elected a year later.
Early estimates by state media on Thursday placed turnout from three days of voting at little over 40 percent, well below the 47 percent of 2014. Sisi is expected to win more than 92 percent of votes, the state media said. He won 97 percent last time.
Final results are due on April 2.
State-run media trumpeted Sisi's victory early on Thursday, saying there was a ""big turnout"", and radio programs said that most of the voters were from Egypt's fast-growing youth.
""The people have chosen their president"", the front page of state-run daily al-Ahram said.
Sisi said on his official Twitter account: ""The images of Egyptians in front of polling stations makes me proud and is proof of the greatness of our nation.""
OPPOSITION CRUSHED
Authorities urged as many eligible voters as possible to cast their ballots, with state media portraying a failure to vote as betrayal of their country.
State news agency MENA reported state-run newspapers as saying that between 23 million and 25 million people had voted, out of an electorate of 59 million.
On the first two days of voting, turnout was about 21 percent, two sources monitoring the election said, and a Western diplomat said that late on Tuesday it was between 15 and 20 percent.
It appeared that more people spoiled their ballots than voted for Sisi's sole challenger, Moussa Mostafa Moussa, who has widely been dismissed as a dummy candidate, the sources said.
""All preliminary reports suggest that turnout is down compared to 2014 despite all the efforts that have been made to raise the numbers,"" Timothy Kaldas, non-resident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, said.
""But it's not clear what consequence the turnout will really have on a government that doesn't appear to believe the people should have a say in who rules them to begin with,"" he said.
All serious opposition dropped out the election race earlier this year citing intimidation after the main challenger, another former military chief, was arrested. Egypt's election commission said the vote would be free and fair, and Sisi said he wished more candidates had run.

Sisi's presidency has returned the military to power after turmoil following the 2011 uprising that toppled long-time leader Hosni Mubarak.

Dinh La Thang, 57, was convicted of ""deliberate violation of state regulations on economic management"", his lawyer, Dao Huu Dang, told Reuters. Thang denied wrongdoing, he said.
Thang was prosecuted in connection with losses of up to 800 billion dong ($35 million) in a PetroVietnam investment in Ocean Commercial Joint Stock Bank.
Ocean Bank suffered heavy losses and was forcibly taken over in 2015 by the State Bank of Vietnam, the central bank.
Thang, the highest-level politician to have been sentenced for decades, will also have to pay a fine of 600 billion dong ($26.31 million), Dang said.
The Politburo is Vietnam's top decision-making body. Thang lost his position in the Politburo last year, after he came under suspicion of wrongdoing.
In January, Thang was handed a 13-year sentence after being found guilty of ""economic mismanagement"" at a coal-fired power plant overseen by state-owned energy firm PetroVietnam, of which he was chairman.
The People's Court of Hanoi also handed sentences of between 15 months of probation to 16 years in prison to six other people for their involvement in the case at the trial starting on Monday last week, according to the lawyer and state media.

Dang said it was not clear if Thang would appeal.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North and South Korea will hold their first summit in more than a decade on April 27, South Korean officials said on Thursday, after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pledged his commitment to denuclearization as tensions ease between the old foes.
South Korean officials, who announced the date after high-level talks with North Korean counterparts, said the agenda would largely be denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and improving inter-Korean relations.
The two Koreas had agreed to hold the summit at the border truce village of Panmunjom when South Korean President Moon Jae-in sent a delegation to Pyongyang this month to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Thursday's meeting was the first high-level dialogue between the two Koreas since the delegation returned from the North.
The two sides said in a joint statement they would hold a working-level meeting on April 4 to discuss details of the summit, such as staffing support, security and news releases.
""We still have a fair number of issues to resolve on a working level for preparations over the next month,"" said Ri Son Gwon, the chairman of North Korea's committee for the peaceful reunification of the country in closing remarks to the South Korean delegation.
""But if the two sides deeply understand the historic significance and meaning of this summit and give their all, we will be able to solve all problems swiftly and amicably,"" Ri added.
Tension over North Korea's tests of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile surged last year and raised fears of U.S. military action in response to North Korea's threat to develop a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United States.
But tension has eased significantly since North Korea decided to send athletes to the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February. The neighbours are technically still at war after the 1950-53 conflict ended with a ceasefire, not a truce.
China commended both sides for their efforts to improve ties.
""We hope the momentum of dialogue can continue and that the peaceful situation also can last,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a briefing.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was encouraged by the recent developments with North Korea. 
    ""I believe that in this world where unfortunately so many problems seem not to have a solution, I think there is here an opportunity for a peaceful solution to something that a few months ago was haunting us as the biggest danger we were facing,"" Guterres told reporters on Thursday. 
'RESOLVE PROBLEMS'
Kim is scheduled to meet U.S. President Donald Trump in May to discuss denuclearization, although a time and place have not been set.
Kim met Chinese President Xi Jinping in a surprise visit to Beijing this week, his first trip outside the isolated North since he came to power in 2011.
Even more surprising was Kim's pledge to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. That commitment was reported by Chinese state media, although North Korea's official media made no mention of it, or Kim's anticipated meeting with Trump.
A senior Chinese official visiting Seoul on Thursday to brief South Korea on Kim's visit to Beijing said it should help ease tension and lead to the denuclearization of the peninsula.
""We believe his visit will help the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, ensure peace and security of the Korean peninsula and resolve problems regarding the peninsula through political negotiations and discussions,"" Yang Jiechi said in opening remarks during a meeting with South Korea's National Security Office head, Chung Eui-yong.
Yang, a top Chinese diplomat, is scheduled to meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Friday.
South Korean Unification Minister Cho Myong-gyon told reporters Kim's visit to China was not discussed with North Korean officials in their Thursday talks.
Trump and Kim had exchanged insults and veiled threats of war in recent months but the U.S. leader made the surprising announcement this month that he was prepared to meet Kim to discuss the crisis over the North's development of weapons.
The North Korean leader's engagement with the international community has sparked speculation that he may try to meet other leaders. Japan's Asahi newspaper said Japan had sounded out the North Korean government about a summit.
Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Kono left open the possibility that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe might meet Kim at some point. Kono said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday that Japan was closely watching preparations for the North-South Korean summit and the Trump-Kim meeting.
Xi promised that Beijing would uphold its friendship with North Korea after his meeting with Kim.

Trump wrote on Twitter he had received a message from Xi late on Tuesday that his meeting with Kim ""went very well"" and that Kim looked forward to meeting the U.S. president.

Salah Abdeslam is being held in France for his alleged role in the November 2015 killing of 130 people in Paris by Islamic State militants. He was also charged with attempted murder over a shootout that occurred days before his arrest in Brussels and IS suicide bombings in the Belgian capital in March 2016. 
He faces up to 20 years in jail over the shootout in which several police officers were wounded.
Abdeslam was taken under heavy security from France to Brussels to appear at the first session of his trial, there where he declined to testify. He was not present at subsequent sessions, and his lawyer argued he should be freed because of procedural mistakes by Belgian prosecutors.
His co-accused, Tunisian Sofien Ayari, said he and Abdeslam were in a Brussels apartment when police arrived, but that neither opened fire. A three-hour siege ended with marksmen killing Mohamed Belkaid, a 35-year-old Algerian, by which time Abdeslam and Ayari had fled. The two were apprehended a few days later at a flat in another district of Brussels. 

Belgian police said they found an arms cache, an Islamic State flag and Abdeslam's DNA in the first apartment where the shootout occurred.

Pell, 76, is the most senior Catholic worldwide to face such charges, the details of which have not been made public. His lawyers have said he will plead not guilty to all charges. Pell is not required to enter a plea unless the magistrate presiding over the hearing determines there is cause for a full trial.
Pell's lawyer Robert Richter will deliver his final submission to the Melbourne Magistrates' Court on April 17 and the prosecution will submit its final response on the same day.
Magistrate Belinda Wallington has yet to say when she will hand down her decision on whether to send Pell to trial.
Richter said the cardinal will be in court when the decision is issued, but said he might not be in court for his final submissions on April 17, citing difficulties of driving up and down from an undisclosed location.
Richter's defense against the charges focused on problems with police procedure, the reliability of witnesses' memories and their psychological conditions. The court heard during the hearing that offences allegedly occurred at a swimming pool and movie theater in Victoria state, a church and other locations.
""In the end, other than (two of the accusers) supporting each other, there's no corroborating evidence for various complainants in this matter,"" Richter said at the end of his cross-examination of witnesses.
""I would disagree,"" Victoria police detective Sergeant Chris Reed told the court. Reed signed off on the charges against Pell in June 2017.
Richter raised concern that police had failed to follow up on inconsistencies in some accusers' allegations and had failed to test some basic evidence, such as whether Pell was in the alleged locations in the alleged timeframes.
In one example, nuns at the place where one of his accusers alleged that offences had occurred said Pell had never been there over that period, but police still brought charges based on the accuser's evidence, Richter told the court.
To lay those charges, the prosecution had to be ""of a view that the nuns were wrong,"" he said.
""I would disagree with that. I would say there were conflicting accounts,"" said Reed.

Pell was called back from Rome to his home country last year to face charges of historical sexual offences from multiple complainants. Charges associated with two of the complainants have since been dropped, as one of them died in January and the other is medically unable to testify.

LASHKAR GAH, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Dozens of peace activists, including women, have set up tents in the Afghan province of Helmand, after a car bomb killed more than a dozen people outside a sports stadium last week.
In a rare development, women from the ethnic Pashtun-dominated region began protesting alongside men in the provincial capital Lashkar Gah on Tuesday, saying that they would later march to a Taliban-controlled district to demand an end to the war.
""I lost my son in one of these explosions and his family are without any support. I am asking the Taliban to accept our demand for peace,"" said Khial Bibi, one of the participants at the women's tent.
The protest did not involve government officials or politicians and was a ""pure people's movement"", said Qais Hashemi, a male protester.
The car bomb exploded on Friday as a wrestling match ended in Lashkar Gah, killing at least 14 people and wounding at least 47. No group has claimed responsibility.
The attack underlined the continued threat of violence across much of Afghanistan with the approach of spring, when fighting tends to pick up.
The Taliban, seeking to restore strict Islamic rule after their 2001 defeat by U.S.-led troops, on Wednesday issued a statement directing the protesters to march toward U.S. military bases instead and demand that they cease fighting.
Protesters against the Taliban were being exploited by U.S. forces, spokesman Qari Muhammad Yousuf Ahmadi said in the statement on a Taliban website.
""The Islamic Emirate is seriously concerned that the enemy circles will misuse your name,"" the statement said.
""Allah forbid, if something were to happen then responsibility will be placed squarely on your shoulders because you understand that we are at war, are facing various enemy plots and will be forced to take serious steps in pursuit of their neutralization.""
The Taliban control large areas of Helmand, which is the source of much of Afghanistan's opium crop. 
President Ashraf Ghani offered last month to hold peace talks with the Taliban but there has so far been little sign the insurgents are willing to end their fight.

The swoop is the latest in a series of similar raids this month, coming as Italy steps up the number of foreigners it expels.
On Wednesday anti-terrorism police arrested an Italian citizen of Moroccan origin who they said was an Islamic State sympathizer planning a truck attack.
""A vast anti-terrorism operation"" was being carried out by special investigation forces based in Rome and the nearby town of Latina, police said in a statement on Thursday.
The five Tunisians detained are suspected of being part of a network connected to Anis Amri, the Tunisian who killed 12 people when he drove a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin in December 2016, judicial sources told Reuters.
Amri was shot dead by Italian police near Milan four days after the Berlin attack. 
Prosecutors suspect the arrested Tunisians of crimes including planning international terrorism, falsifying documents and helping illegal immigration of radicalized Tunisians, the sources said.
However, the sources said there was no evidence the suspects participated directly in the Berlin truck attack or that they were preparing any imminent attack in Italy.
As part of their operation, police were carrying out searches in Rome, the southern port city of Naples and the central and southern towns of Latina, Viterbo, Caserta and Matera, the sources said.
Interior Minister Marco Minniti said on Wednesday the security threat to Italy from Islamic State supporters was higher than ever because more foreign fighters were attempting to return to Europe via Italy after the jihadist group suffered defeats in Syria and Iraq.
So far this year, 29 foreigners, mostly Muslims, have been expelled from Italy as suspected threats to national security.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A Cambodian court has charged two journalists with producing pornography in addition to espionage charges they already face for filing news reports to a U.S.-funded radio station, their lawyer said on Thursday.
Washington-based Radio Free Asia (RFA) was shut in Cambodia last year amid a crackdown on the opposition and media by the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has accused the United States of trying to end his rule of more than 33 years.
A Cambodian rights group described the new charges against former RFA journalists Uon Chhin and Yeang Sothearin as another attack on the free press.
Their lawyer, Keo Vanny, said the court had informed him of the pornography charges on Wednesday. They had committed no such crime, he said. The charge carries a prison sentence of up to one year in prison.
Pro-government media have published pixelated images of people in sexual positions and said that they are related to the case, but the accused are not identifiable in any of the images.
Court spokesman Ly Sophanna and Radio Free Asia did not respond to requests for comment.
Rights groups have condemned the detention of the men, who were arrested in November and charged with espionage for filing news reports to RFA. They deny the accusation and say they were just doing their job.
Chak Sopheap, executive director at the Cambodian Center for Human Rights, said the pornography charges appeared aimed at destroying the pair's reputations.
""This entire prosecution should be seen for what it is: a blatant attempt to limit press freedom, and to silence and intimidate all independent journalists in Cambodia who dare to speak and reveal the truth,"" she said.
In an unrelated case, a Cambodian court last week suspended 10 months of a one-year jail term for a British man found guilty of producing pornography in connection with a pool party in the town of Siem Reap, home to the ruins of Angkor Wat.
Authorities said partygoers danced provocatively and posted pictures of themselves on social media.

Police launched simultaneous operations in 38 provinces across Turkey in a probe led by state prosecutors in the central Turkish province of Konya, the broadcaster said.
It said the suspects were targeted based on statements by soldiers previously detained over ties to the cleric Fethullah Gulen and were believed to have been responsible for recruiting students for Gulen's movement.
The U.N. human rights office said earlier this month Turkey has detained 160,000 people and dismissed nearly the same number of civil servants since the failed coup in July 2016, which Ankara blames on Gulen. He denies any involvement.
Among those detained, more than 50,000 have been formally charged and kept in jail during trial.

Turkey's Western allies have criticized the crackdown. Critics of President Tayyip Erdogan accuse him of using the failed putsch as a pretext to quash dissent. Turkey says the measures are necessary to combat threats to national security.

High court judge George Odunga said both men had ""conducted themselves in a most despicable manner not expected in this constitutional era"" - an unprecedented rebuke of such senior figures.
Interior minister Fred Matiang'i and police inspector general Joseph Boinnet were each fined 200,000 Kenyan shillings ($1,985) for their part in the detention of opposition politician Miguna Miguna this week.
The minister would appeal, his ministry said. There was no immediate comment from the police.
Opposition groups and activists have repeatedly accused the government failing to respect the authority of the courts in political matters - a charge the government denies.
Miguna - who holds dual Canadian citizenship - was detained after he flew into Nairobi on Wednesday and held at the airport, he and his lawyer said.
A court ordered his release and then, when his detention continued, found both the minister and police chief guilty of contempt of court on Thursday for ignoring its ruling.
Hours later, Miguna was placed on an Emirates flight to Dubai, his lawyer said - the second time he has been deported this year. 
On Thursday, the politician said he had been dragged, assaulted and drugged during the forced deportation. ""I’m sick. I need medical treatment ... I need urgent help here,"" he said on Twitter. 
Kenyan authorities initially deported Miguna in February, saying he had rescinded his Kenyan citizenship when he acquired Canadian nationality but a court ruled he should be allowed back.

The ministry had denied that Miguna was being held illegally this week and said he had failed to follow arrival procedures when he landed in Kenya.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his ratings battered by a scandal over suspected cronyism, is hoping a series of summits including one with U.S. President Donald Trump will restore his popularity ahead of a crucial ruling party leadership contest.
Abe is expected to meet Trump around April 18 in Washington to discuss Trump's planned meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and then meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in late May. Tokyo has also not ruled out a meeting with Kim Jong Un.
""Mr Abe is the most pro-active on foreign policy among Japanese prime ministers and wants to use that,"" a ruling coalition lawmaker told Reuters.
""Especially ahead of the September Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) presidential election, he wants to appeal to voters through his meetings with Trump and Putin.""
Abe's ratings have fallen sharply due to the scandal over the sale of state-owned land to school operator Moritomo Gakuen, to which Abe's wife had ties, and after a finance ministry admission that documents about the deal were altered.
The slide in his ratings has clouded his prospects of winning a third, three-year term as LDP president, victory in which would set him on track to become Japan's longest-serving premier, a position he's held since 2012.
The LDP leader is virtually assured of being prime minister since an LDP-led coalition holds a majority in parliament.
Abe is hoping his diplomatic performance will distract voters from the domestic scandal.
""He's trying to change the conversation and the chances are it will work,"" said Gerry Curtis, an emeritus professor at New York's Columbia University.
""On Monday, the betting was Abe would probably announce that he isn't running for a third term. Today, the betting is he will get a third term,"" he said. 
But much depended on opinion polls and whether new allegations of misconduct emerged, Curtis added. 
'NO RISK, NO RETURN'
In addition, success at summits is by no means guaranteed.
""Of course, there are risks,"" the coalition lawmaker said. ""Politics is a world of 'no risk, no return'."" 
Trump has blindsided Tokyo twice in recent weeks, first by announcing that he would meet Kim Jong Un and then by declining to exclude ally Japan from tariffs on steel and aluminum.
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono told Reuters on Tuesday that the two allies were ""completely in sync"" on North Korea but concerns persist that Trump may do a deal that protects U.S. interests but leaves Japan vulnerable.
On the trade front, Tokyo is pressing Washington to exempt Japan's steel products from the levies and pushing back against demands for a two-way free trade agreement, a stance the government repeated forcefully on Thursday.
Abe may have little concrete to offer Trump on trade other than restating plans, already in the works, to boost defense spending and buy U.S. military equipment.
The Japanese leader may also find it tough to get concessions from Putin in a decades-old row over islands seized by Soviet forces at the end of World War Two. The dispute has kept Moscow and Tokyo from signing a peace treaty.
""Putin is just playing the game,"" a former senior Japanese diplomat said, while adding that even a small breakthrough in the dispute would be a ""great success"" for Abe.
Any meeting between Abe and Kim Jong Un would be tricky, and forecasts that one will happen are premature, another ruling party lawmaker said. 
To gain kudos, Abe needs progress on the emotive issue of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea decades ago, but North Korea would likely want economic aid in return.
Japan's stance, however, has been that aid can only be resumed if the two countries normalize diplomatic relations, which depends on the North abandoning its nuclear and missile programs as well as resolving the abductee issue.

269,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 02:11AM ET</span>","Japan offers North Korea summit, Pyongyang discussing meetings with Japan: Asahi","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan has sounded out the North Korean government about a bilateral summit, and Pyongyang has discussed the possibility of a leaders' meeting with Japan, Japan's Asahi newspaper said on Thursday.
The government of Kim Jong Un has informed leaders of North Korea's ruling Korean Workers Party of the possibility of a summit with Japan, the newspaper said, citing an unidentified North Korean source and briefing papers.
""The Japanese government has expressed a wish to host a leaders meeting, via the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan,"" or Chongryon, Pyongyang's de facto embassy in Japan, the Asahi quoted the North Korean briefing papers as saying.
The Japanese government said it had been in touch with the North but declined to offer specific comment on the report.
""We have been communicating with North Korea through various occasions and means such as a route via our embassy in Beijing, but I would like to refrain from going into specifics,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a regular news conference. 
A Chongryon spokesman in Tokyo declined to comment on the Asahi report.
A Japanese government source told Reuters in mid-March that Japan was considering seeking a summit between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Kim to discuss Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean agents decades ago. 
The Asahi said in an article from Seoul Kim's government had explained its bilateral diplomatic plans for South Korea, the United States, China, Japan and Russia, in that order. 
Kim met President Xi Jinping in China this week, his first trip abroad since taking over as North Korean leader in 2011. Summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and U.S. President Donald Trump are being planned for April and May, respectively.
The North Korean briefing papers cite the possibility of a Japan summit in early June, the Asahi said. 
Japan's Foreign Minister Taro Kono left open the possibility that Abe might meet Kim at some point. Kono said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday Japan was closely watching preparations for the North-South Korean summit and the Trump-Kim meeting.
A Japanese ruling party lawmaker said the outlook for an Abe-Kim summit depended on how the earlier summits played out. 
""There are stages and barriers,"" he told Reuters. ""In particular, there's no guarantee Trump-Kim talks will go well.""
The Asahi quoted another unidentified source as saying North Korea's ""dialogue partner on security issues is America"" but that the country ""can only hope for large-scale financial assistance from Japan"".
North Korea hopes to get $20 billion to $50 billion in aid from Japan if it normalizes relations, the newspaper said. However, it said the briefing papers offered no specifics about steps to normalize bilateral relations, as agreed in 2002. 
Those steps include resolving the abductee issue, as well as Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons development.

North Korea admitted in 2002 it had kidnapped 13 Japanese in the 1970s and 1980s to train spies, and five of them returned to Japan. Tokyo suspects that hundreds more may have been taken.

Families hoping for news outside the police station were dispersed with tear gas and authorities did not give information until late into the evening.
“The State Prosecutor’s Office guarantees to deepen investigations to immediately clarify what happened in these painful events that have left dozens of Venezuelan families in mourning,” said Chief Prosecutor Tarek William Saab on Twitter.
Venezuelan prisons are notoriously overcrowded and filled with weapons and drugs. Riots leaving dozens dead are not uncommon.

""Forensic doctors are determining the number of fatalities,"" Santander said. A policeman was shot in the leg and was in a stable condition and firefighters had extinguished the flames, he said.
Many Venezuelan prisons are lawless and have been for decades. Prisoners often openly wield machine guns and grenades, use drugs and leave guards powerless.

""There are people who are inside those dungeons (...) and the authorities do not know they exist because they do not dare to enter,"" said Humberto Prado, a local prisons rights activist.

273,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2018 06:44AM ET</span>",Nobel winner Malala in tears on emotional return to Pakistan,"By Kay Johnson and Asif Shahzad
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai broke down in tears during an emotional return to her native Pakistan on Thursday, six years after she was shot in the head by Taliban gunmen for advocating greater education of girls.
Yousafzai, traveling with her father and younger brother, met Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in the capital, Islamabad, before giving a brief speech on national television.
It was Yousafzai's first visit to her homeland since she was shot in late 2012 and airlifted abroad for medical treatment. 
""For last five years I have dreamed that I can set foot in my country,"" she said, wiping away tears
""It's the happiest day of my life. I still can't believe it's happening,"" added Yousafzai, clad in a traditional shalwar khameez outfit with her head covered with a red and blue duppata scarf.
She said that if it had been up to her, she would never have left Pakistan.
""I don't normally cry ... I'm still 20 years old but I've seen so many things in life,"" she said.
At the age of 17, in 2014, Yousafzai became the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for her education advocacy. She also became a global symbol of the resilience of women in the face of repression.
Yousafzai spoke of the importance of education and about the efforts of her charitable foundation to help girls, often switching between English and the Pashto and Urdu languages.
""Welcome home,"" Prime Minister Abbasi told Yousafzai. 
""We are very happy that our daughter has come back. When she went away, she was a child of 12. She has returned as the most prominent citizen of Pakistan ""
But she is unlikely to travel to her home region of Swat, in mountains northwest of Islamabad, due to security threats against her, a relative and security sources told Reuters.
""It's been long-held desire of Malala Yousafzai and her parents to visit Swat and see her relatives and friends. But she was not given permission due to security concerns,"" said one relative, who declined to be identified.
Earlier, Pakistan's Geo TV showed footage of Yousafzai after she arrived at Islamabad airport, walking to a car escorted by security officials.
In October 2012, masked gunmen stopped a bus taking Malala and other girls home from school and shot her. Two of her friends were also wounded.
Last week, on Twitter, Yousafzai, who lives in Britain and is studying at Oxford University, expressed a longing for her homeland.
""On this day, I cherish fond memories of home, of playing cricket on rooftops and singing the national anthem in school. Happy Pakistan Day!"" she wrote on March 23.
POLARIZING FIGURE
After surviving the attack, Yousafzai was airlifted abroad and underwent surgery. 
The Pakistani Taliban, who seized control of her home district in Pakistan's Swat Valley before being pushed out by the army in 2009, claimed the attack, saying it was in response to a blog she wrote for the BBC Urdu service advocating girls' education.
The hardline Islamist movement blew up girls' schools and imposed a strict interpretation of sharia Islamic law during their rule over Swat.
The Taliban also accused her of promoting Western values in Swat, which is a staunchly conservative parts of the mainly-Muslim nation.
Unable to return to Pakistan after her recovery, Yousafzai stayed in Britain, setting up the Malala Fund and supporting education advocacy groups with a focus on Pakistan, Nigeria, Jordan, Syria and Kenya.
This month, a new girls' school built with her Nobel prize money opened in Shangla, near her home district of Swat.
During her trip to Pakistan, which is expected to last several days, Yousafzai will likely stay in Islamabad and meet friends and family at a hotel, her relatives said.
While she is arguably the most recognizable Pakistani in the world, Yousafzai - known almost universally as Malala - is a polarizing figure at home.
She is frequently attacked by religious conservatives as portraying her country in a bad light and seeking fame.
""A traitor has arrived to Pakistan,"" was one response on Twitter to news of her return, though many other tweets were positive.
A private school headmaster in Swat, Ahmad Shah, said the region's people were eager to greet her.
""Her visit had in fact removed all the rumors, as some people were saying she would never return to Pakistan again,"" the headmaster said.

""I have noted that the girls in Swat and elsewhere in Pakistan see Malala as their own and believe that whatever she is doing is meant for them,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday rejected Saudi Arabia's bid to dismiss lawsuits claiming that it helped plan the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and should pay billions of dollars in damages to victims.
U.S. District Judge George Daniels in Manhattan said the plaintiffs' allegations ""narrowly articulate a reasonable basis"" for him to assert jurisdiction over Saudi Arabia under the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), a 2016 federal law.
The Saudi government has long denied involvement in the attacks in which hijacked airplanes crashed into New York's World Trade Center, the Pentagon outside Washington, D.C., and a Pennsylvania field. Nearly 3,000 people died.
Lawyers for Saudi Arabia did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the decision. At a Saudi stock market event in New York, asked whether the court decision would have a negative impact on Saudi investment in the United States, Capital Market Authority Chairman Mohammed A. ElKuwaiz declined to comment, saying he had not seen the news.
Daniels' decision covers claims by the families of those killed, roughly 25,000 people who suffered injuries, and many businesses and insurers.
The judge also dismissed claims that two Saudi banks, National Commercial Bank and Al Rajhi Bank, and Saudi Binladin Group, a construction company controlled by the bin Laden family, provided funds and financial services for the attacks, saying he lacked jurisdiction.
Saudi Arabia had long had broad immunity from Sept. 11 lawsuits in the United States.
That changed in September 2016, when the U.S. Congress overrode President Barack Obama's veto of JASTA, allowing such cases to proceed.
Obama had warned that the law could expose U.S. companies, troops and officials to lawsuits in other countries.
Daniels said the plaintiffs could try to prove that Saudi Arabia was liable for the alleged activities of Fahad al Thumairy, an imam at the King Fahad Mosque in Culver City, California, and Omar al Bayoumi, said to be an intelligence officer.
They were accused of helping two hijackers acclimate themselves to the United States, and begin preparing for the attacks.
Saudi Arabia had argued that the plaintiffs could not show that any Saudi official, employee or agent planned or carried out the attacks.
James Kreindler, a lawyer for many of the plaintiffs, said he was ""delighted"" the case can proceed.
""We have been pressing to proceed with the case and conduct discovery from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, so that the full story can come to light, and expose the Saudi role in the 9/11 attacks,"" he said in a phone interview.
The judge also dismissed claims against the state-affiliated charity Saudi High Commission for Relief of Bosnia & Herzegovina, saying the plaintiffs' ""guilt-by-association"" claims did not overcome its presumption of immunity.

The case is In re: Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 03-md-01570.

276,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 05:40PM ET</span>","The future is bright, promises PM May on tour of Brexit-divided country","By William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May will promise Britain bright prospects outside the European Union on Thursday when she tours a country still deeply divided about its future as the countdown to Brexit starts its last 12 months.
Britain will leave the European Union at 2300 GMT on March 29, 2019, severing ties that helped define its national identity, its laws, and its international stature over 46 years of integration with European neighbors.
The world's sixth largest economy caused a major global shock in 2016 by narrowly voting to withdraw from the EU after a fevered referendum campaign that sharpened regional divisions, pitted young against old, and exposed a deep distrust between voters and the political establishment. 
In the 21 months since the referendum vote, May, who became prime minister in the resulting political chaos, has struggled to unite the country behind a single vision of Brexit.
Polls show voters' disparate views on leaving are entrenched, and few have any certainty about Britain's long term future.
On Thursday, May will meet voters in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland -- a whirlwind tour designed as a rallying cry for the union between the four nations, and to paint a positive post-Brexit vision. 
""I am determined that our future will be a bright one,"" she said ahead of the roughly 800-mile (1,280 km) trip ending in London. 
""It's a future in which we trade freely with friends and partners across Europe and beyond. Having regained control of our laws, our borders and our money, and seized the opportunities provided by Brexit, the UK will thrive as a strong and united country that works for everyone, no matter whether you voted Leave or Remain.""
LONG WAY TO GO
May, 61, has 12 months to plot a successful course through difficult political and economic terrain. 
Brexiteers fret that the EU divorce is taking too long and could be reversed. Pro-EU campaigners still push for a less radical exit or a second referendum.
At home, May only has a small majority in parliament and must find a way to corral her Conservative Party, which is still split over the best Brexit plan, into backing legislation that will prepare Britain for life outside the bloc.
That task has so far swamped her government and its administrative machine, leading to accusations she has taken the eye off the ball on domestic policy and given the socialist-led Labour Party a chance to build support ahead of a 2022 election.
In Brussels, May's ministers have won little in the way of concessions from the EU negotiating team, setting a difficult tone for upcoming talks on long-term trading ties - particularly when it comes to the future of Britain's economic engine: its financial services sector.
But, a transitional deal that effectively keeps Britain inside the EU single market until the end of 2020, agreed in principle last week with Brussels, has calmed anxious businesses and bought May time to work out the details of post-Brexit policy.
Among those challenges will be holding together the United Kingdom, made up of four nations which were split at the referendum: Wales and England voted to leave the EU, Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain. 
Scotland and Wales are drawing up contingency plans to protect their own interests in case they can not reach agreement with May on how powers regained from Brussels are redistributed.
Northern Ireland is into a second year of a political crisis that has left it without a devolved administration, and the future management of its land border with EU-member Ireland is one of the thorniest issues outstanding in talks with Brussels.
Against that backdrop, May's tour on Thursday will focus on meeting a cross-section of voters to reassure them that she is working to tear down the barriers thrown up by the referendum, and that whether they voted 'Leave' or 'Remain', they will be better off after Brexit.

""I am determined that as we leave the EU, and in the years ahead, we will strengthen the bonds that unite us, because ours is the world’s most successful union,"" she said.

Security Council condemns Houthi missile attacks on Saudi Arabia,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council on Wednesday condemned a barrage of missile attacks against Saudi Arabia by Yemen's Houthi group and expressed grave concern at reports of violations of an U.N. arms embargo on Houthi leaders.
Saudi forces said they shot down three missiles over Riyadh shortly before midnight on Sunday. Debris fell on a home in the capital, killing an Egyptian man and wounding two others. They said air defences also repelled missiles fired at the southern Saudi cities of Najran, Jizan and Khamis Mushait.
In a statement, the 15-member Security Council expressed alarm at a Houthi threat to continue such attacks in the region.
Sunday's attacks threaten to sharply escalate a war that has unleashed what the United Nations considers the world's most urgent humanitarian crisis. Millions of Yemenis live under threat of mass starvation and disease, at the mercy of combatants who have sometimes cut off food and medical supplies.
""The members of the Security Council expressed their grave concern at the continued deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Yemen and the devastating humanitarian impact of the conflict on civilians,"" the statement said. 
The three-year conflict pits a coalition of Sunni Arab states friendly to the West against the Houthis, a Shi'ite armed movement sympathetic to Iran. The Houthis, who deny they are Iranian pawns and say their movement is a national revolution against corruption, control the north of Yemen.
Independent U.N. experts reported to the Security Council in January that Iran had violated U.N. sanctions on Yemen because ""it failed to take the necessary measures to prevent the direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer"" of ballistic missiles and other equipment to the Houthi group. 
The U.N. Security Council statement on Wednesday did not name who is violating the arms embargo.
Last month, Russia vetoed a western bid for the United Nations Security Council to call out Tehran for failing to prevent its weapons from falling into the hands of the Houthis. Iran has denied supplying the Houthis weapons.

The Trump administration has for months been lobbying for Iran to be held accountable at the United Nations, while at the same time threatening to quit a 2015 deal among world powers to curb Iran's nuclear program if ""disastrous flaws"" are not fixed.

Maas told reporters before his first United Nations visit as foreign minister that Germany's candidacy had been announced long ago, and did not diminish its strong support for Israel.
""We are not running against anyone; we are running for a seat,"" he said, following the criticism from Washington's nominee as U.S. ambassador to Berlin and others. ""That is a topic that one can deal with very normally.""
The Council comprises five permanent members and 10 non-permanent members elected by the U.N. General Assembly for two-year terms. Germany last held a non-permanent seat in 2011-12 and is vying with Israel and Belgium for one of the two seats to be filled in 2019-20.
Richard Grenell, whose nomination is held up in the Senate, said earlier this month that the United States had brokered a deal in the 1990s with countries in the U.N.'s Western European and Others Group to allow Israel to run uncontested for a seat.
Grenell, the U.S. spokesman at the U.N. from 2001 to 2009, tweeted about the issue on March 14, saying, ""Israel has waited 19 years! The US must demand that Europe keep its word.""
German diplomats deny any such agreement was made. The Israeli mission to the U.N. declined to comment on Grenell's tweet. 
Conservative and pro-Israeli groups in the United States have also criticized Germany's decision to run for the seat at the same time as Israel. 
Maas said Germany was well-placed to serve on the Council since it was the second largest provider of both funds and troops for the U.N. and played a big role in humanitarian and stabilization missions, as well as on climate change.
Security Council candidates must win more than two-thirds of the overall vote by the 193-member General Assembly to be elected. The election for the term beginning on Jan. 1, 2019 is due to be held in June.
The Council, on which the five permanent members - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia - hold veto powers, is the only U.N. body that can make legally binding decisions, as well as imposing sanctions and authorizing the use of force.
To ensure geographical representation on the Council, there are five seats for African and Asian states; one for Eastern European states; two for the Latin American and Caribbean states and two for Western European and other states.

Regional groups generally agree upon the candidates to put forward and competitive races for seats are increasingly rare.

Assange has been living in the Ecuadorean embassy in London since June 2012, when he entered the building to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning about allegations of sex crimes, which he has always denied. 
He recently spoke on social media about a diplomatic crisis between London and Moscow and about Catalonia, despite warnings by Ecuador to avoid controversial politics.
""The measure was adopted in the face of Assange's failure to comply with a written commitment he assumed with the government at the end of 2017, under which he was obliged not to issue messages that would interfere with other states,"" the Ecuadorian government said in a statement.
The statement did not say which communication system it had suspended. In 2016, Ecuador restricted Assange's internet access for commenting on U.S. internal affairs. 
Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno has described Assange as a stone in his shoe inherited from his predecessor and the government has said the situation is ""unsustainable."" In December, Ecuador granted Assange citizenship.
The Swedish investigation was dropped in May last year, but Assange, who was on bail at the time when he walked into the embassy, faces arrest by the British authorities for breaching his bail terms should he step outside.
Assange says the real reason for his legal troubles is the fact that WikiLeaks published U.S. diplomatic and military secrets, and he fears that if he leaves the embassy he risks being extradited to the United States.

British Foreign Office Minister Alan Duncan described Assange on Tuesday as a ""miserable little worm"" who should leave the embassy and give himself up to British justice.

The suspected driver was later arrested and his vehicle was seized, a police spokesman said. 
""We do not believe the general public is at risk,"" San Francisco police spokesman Robert Rueca said at a news conference, calling it an isolated incident.
The people were taken to Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, where one died and one was in critical condition, hospital spokesman Brent Andrew said. The three others were in serious or fair condition.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - More than one third of President Michel Temer's cabinet will resign over the next week to campaign for their Congressional seats in the October general election, presidential aides said on Wednesday.
Temer himself plans to run for president though that will depend on whether the leader's high disapproval rate falls as the economy gathers steam, according to two aides, who were not authorized to speak to the media.
The exodus of 11 ministers includes Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles who is expected to quit by Tuesday to announce that he is joining the ruling Brazilian Democratic Movement party (MDB) and could become Temer's running mate or bid for president himself if Temer does not run, the aides said.
While he had not announced his plans, Temer said he could run in a radio interview on Wednesday, ""because the government needs a candidate who defends its achievements"" in recovering Latin America's biggest economy from its worst recession.
He said Meirelles would also be ""very able"" for the job.
Health Minister Ricardo Barros turned in his resignation on Tuesday, and Transport Minister Mauricio Quintella is expected to do so on Thursday, one of the aides said. He will be replaced by the head of the National Transport Infrastructure Department, Valter Silveira, another government source said.
The ministers of mines and energy, communications, education, environment, tourism, sports, social development and national integration will all leave by April 7, the deadline to quit government posts to be able to run in the election.
The head of the National Development Bank BNDES, Paulo Rabello, has also announced his departure 
Temer, 77, who came to power in 2016 when President Dilma Rousseff was impeached, has to decide by a party convention in June whether he is a viable contender to keep the top job. 
If Temer's approval ratings does not improve by then, former banking executive and central bank governor Meirelles would be the government's presidential candidate, the two Temer aides told Reuters.
They both said Deputy Finance Minister Eduardo Guardia was the most likely pick to replace Meirelles.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Fifteen European Union countries including Britain signed the first project under its new defense research fund on Wednesday, the latest small step toward integrating European militaries and their industries.
While the 35-million-euro ($43 million) EU grant for naval surveillance technology is modest, the fund aims to grow from its pilot phase to a multi-mullion-euro undertaking from 2021.
""It's an important moment, we've managed to gather together 42 companies from 15 member states,"" European Industry Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska told reporters following a signing ceremony.
Italy's aerospace and defense group Leonardo SPA will lead the Ocean2020 project that also includes Estonia, France, Greece, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.
Officials say years of cuts in defense research have put Europe's future military capabilities at risk, but now France and Germany are leading a broad effort to develop and deploy the bloc's armed forces together.
The signing at the European Commission follows a flurry of diplomatic breakthroughs on defense collaboration after Britain - Europe's main military power along with France - voted in 2016 to quit the EU. London long blocked such plans, fearing the creation of EU armed forces.
Facing a range of threats on its borders from the Caucasus to the Sahara, EU states, now unfettered by British opposition, launched a pact in December to integrate defenses.
Earlier this month, 25 countries also agreed to develop their first joint projects under the pact. 
The European Commission has proposed a 1.5 billion euro annual European Defence Fund to support defense capabilities that will include 500 million euros for defense research, up from the current 90-million-euro pilot phase. 
The Commission hopes EU governments will add to the fund to develop projects and weapons, eventually taking it toward 5 billion euros a year, with assets owned by member states.
""WE NEED THE UK""
The long-term EU goal is in coordination with NATO but to reduce reliance on the United States, which wants Europeans to pay more for their own security. 
Britain is concerned about being left outside the new cooperation and missing out on weapons projects. Prime Minister Theresa May wants to reach a ""security treaty"" with the EU by 2019.
It was not immediately clear whether Britain could continue in Ocean2020 after it leaves the bloc in a year's time. 
Leonardo's CEO Alessandro Profumo said it was important for Britain to remain in European defense efforts, partly because the Italian firm has 7,000 staff in Britain. ""Not only for us but for the European defense system, we need the U.K.,"" he told reporters. 
Britain hopes negotiations on its future security role in the EU will start soon. But EU officials said May would need to submit a formal paper to detail her ideas and then allow EU and British negotiators to move forward.

284,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",Hungary gave visa to Syrian man under U.S. sanctions for assisting Assad: websites,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - A Syrian man who is under U.S. sanctions for assisting the Syrian government received residency status in Hungary under a visa bond program launched by Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, two Hungarian websites reported.
The investigative portals Direkt36 and 444.hu said on Wednesday in a joint report, citing unnamed sources, that Hungary gave a residency permit to Atiya Khoury, who the United States accused in 2016 of paying for fuel procurements for President Bashar al-Assad's government.
The ""golden visa scheme"" launched in 2013, which guarantees temporary residency for at least five years to foreigners buying a Hungarian bond for up to 300,000 euros, helped Hungary raise funds at a time when its credit rating languished in ""junk"" status. Hungary halted the program last year.
Orban's chief of staff Janos Lazar told a regular news conference that national security bodies had screened all those who had bought residency bonds.
""I'm sure that they screened everyone very thoroughly ... I have no doubt about that,"" he said when asked repeatedly about the report. He did not address specific details in the report.
The websites' allegation that certain Syrians were among those allowed to buy residency comes at a sensitive time for Orban's right-wing government which has been fiercely campaigning against Muslim immigrants ahead of an election on April 8.
The websites said it could also be a worrying lapse of national security, if it were confirmed. 
Orban is seeking a third consecutive term and his party has a lead over the opposition in the opinion polls.
The opposition Socialist party urged the government to clarify whether it let ""criminals"" settle in Hungary, and the opposition Democratic Coalition and LMP parties demanded more clarity on the issue.
The Immigration Office did not reply to Reuters questions regarding the identity of the man who the websites said received his status under the bond program. 
The government did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Hungary's intelligence agency did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.
Reuters could not independently verify the websites' report, which did not say when the Syrian man was given the visa. 
Direkt36 said it received a list of names from an unnamed source which included individuals from several countries, not just Syria, who took part in the visa program. Another source familiar with the administrative process confirmed the man and his relatives received residency permits through the program, Direkt36 said. 
It highlighted a second Syrian man who Italian authorities suspect took part in an international money-laundering scheme. Direkt36 said he was detained by police on Nov. 28, 2017, in Hungary. Police did not reply to requests for comment.
The U.S. Treasury Department said on its website at the time when it imposed sanctions that the man the Hungarian websites identified, alternatively spelled as Atiya Khouri by the U.S. Treasury, operated a firm Moneta Transfer & Exchange and moved cash between Syria, Lebanon, and Russia on behalf of another man, and with authority from the government of Syria, 
""He paid for fuel procurement for the government of Syria using Moneta Transfer & Exchange and received a commission for these transactions,"" it added at the time.
It was not possible to contact the man.

ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (Reuters) - Egypt's last permitted Islamist party is backing former military chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi for a second presidential term, a quirk of electoral politics that reflects the precarious state of the country's Islamists.
The ultra-conservative Nour Party believes it has no choice but to support Sisi if it wants to survive in a country where Islamists of other stripes are a political and military target for the army-backed authorities.
With turnout the authorities' top concern in an election this week Sisi is virtually guaranteed to win, the Nour Party is trying to ensure its members are seen at the polls by bussing in voters from poor areas. 
It has also set up centers to track participation and help people find their polling stations. 
While not unexpected, it is still an eye-catching maneuver by a party that has traditionally defined itself by opposition to all things Western. Islamists including the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood were for decades the backbone of opposition to autocratic rule in Egypt.
Nour, founded after the toppling of Hosni Mubarak in 2011, has learned to adapt to shifts in the political landscape: It broke with the Brotherhood after it became clear that Egypt’s oldest Islamist group would not be able to stay in power. 
""Do I have an alternative?"" said Yasser Borhami, a cleric in Nour's parent organization, the Salafi Calling.
""(We are) looking for the benefit of the country .. (We) are unfit (to run for office) in this period after the earthquake, so where is the alternative?"" he told Reuters, referring to the tumultuous years following the popular revolt of 2011. 
Leading Nour Party figure Galal Morra was one of a handful of religious and political leaders who flanked Sisi, then the army chief, when he went on television to announce the removal of President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013 after a series of mass protests against his rule.
Nearly five years on, the group, which once held 25 percent of parliament's seats but now has only two percent, is still campaigning heavily for Sisi and struggling to prove its loyalty amid a political climate of fear, distrust and cynicism. 
""Am I even ready to run for elections?"" Borhami replied, when asked why the party did not nominate its own candidate for the presidential seat. 
""Are state institutions going to cooperate with me? I'm coming after an earthquake, after the Muslim Brotherhood's glaring failure in running the state and a major societal clash ... I'm not crazy enough to ask to run the state in light of these circumstances.""
The bearded 59-year-old spoke from a small party office in Egypt's second city Alexandria, still a Salafi stronghold despite a ferocious government crackdown on Islamists including a military campaign against jihadists in Sinai.
Sisi's only formal election contender was an obscure politician loyal to him. More serious challengers were forced out and several opposition politicians called for a boycott of the vote, saying repression had removed credible challengers.
UNLIKELY ALLIES
Nour's acceptance of Sisi in 2013 was viewed with suspicion by both liberals and Islamists including the Brotherhood, which was banned and declared a terrorist group. The party rejects accusations by critics that it has betrayed the Islamist cause.
Not everyone in Nour is happy with its cautious stance.
Some of the group's youth, which make up more than 75 percent of those who participated in rallies and organized ahead of the vote, are believed to want a more assertive stance.
But Abdullah Badran, Nour's general secretary, told Reuters that the decision of the party leadership to get involved in the campaign had been followed by its ""base"".
Three female party members said other voters and authorities securing the polling stations appeared surprised to see the group of women wearing all-encompassing burqa gowns and niqabs, the full-face veils worn by ultra-conservative Muslim women.

""They even asked to take selfies with us,"" one woman said.

After coming to power in 2016, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev pledged to put an end to human rights abuses, and his government allowed the New York-based rights group to resume work in the country last year after a seven-year ban.
""Many journalists told Human Rights Watch that freedom of the press had slightly increased under President Mirziyoyev and described a media environment that has entered a period of change,"" it said.
""But all pointed to censorship and fear of repression by security services as a major factor in how they conduct their work.""
Among other moves, Mirziyoyev has ordered the release of at least 27 political prisoners, including nine journalists, jailed under his predecessor Islam Karimov who ruled with an iron fist for 27 years.
The government has also relaxed certain restrictions on free expression, HRW said in a report based on interviews with Uzbek reporters, editors and media owners. 
But security services detained reporter Bobomurod Abdullayev last year on suspicion of calling for a violent overthrow of the government. Abdullayev said at his trial this month he had been beaten, deprived of sleep and kept in solitary confinement.
The government did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

""If President Mirziyoyev truly aspires to transition from an era of abuses to one where human rights are respected, he should send a clear signal that peaceful criticism of government policies – whether by journalists, rights activists, or religious believers – has a protected place in Uzbekistan,"" HRW said.

288,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>","Polyglot Ethiopian premier must ease ethnic, youth tensions","By Aaron Maasho
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - In choosing a 42-year-old polyglot from Ethiopia's largest ethnic group as prime minister, the ruling coalition is trying to ease ethnic tensions and appeal to the legions of disaffected youth.
Former army Lieutenant-Colonel Abiye Ahmed, who speaks three Ethiopian languages and co-founded a branch of the intelligence services, is now under pressure to deliver the stability that his Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) craves.
Abiye got the job on Tuesday, succeeding Hailemariam Desalegn who quit to clear the way for reforms.
Oromiya region, which surrounds the capital Addis Ababa, has been rocked by violence since 2015. This is fueled largely by a sense among young members of the Oromo ethnic group, which makes up roughly a third of the 100 million population, that they are politically and economically marginalized.
Abiye's Oromo heritage appears to be a calculated attempt to soothe this anger. But his broader room for maneuver may be hemmed in by the strictures of the EPRDF, the rebel coalition that took over from the Derg military regime in 1991.
Dissident politicians say the EPRDF, which holds all 547 seats in parliament, is not yet ready to allow more freedom in what remains one of Africa's most tightly controlled states. 
""Attempts to enact change will depend on the coalition's readiness,"" said Merera Gudina, an Oromo opposition leader and former parliamentarian who spent a year in jail on charges of inciting unrest. ""Some of its leaders may still be thinking within their own box and seek cosmetic changes that will not take the country forward.""
Abiye's rise to lead the coalition was challenged by members of the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a party from the northern Tigray region which dominates the coalition.
The TPLF is often at odds within the coalition with Abiye's Oromo People's Democratic Organisation (OPDO), with both parties accusing the other of interference. 
""Abiye is part of the system. But it is change in the sense that the OPDO had to fight the TPLF and the system to get where they are now,"" an EPRDF member who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters.
Street protests in Oromiya began three years ago over land rights and grew into calls for broader political and personal freedoms.
Security forces killed hundreds of people and arrested tens of thousands in what has become the biggest threat to the EPRDF since it seized power. The unrest has also deepened tensions between Ethiopia's main ethnic groups.
The violence and internal EPRDF disagreements over the pace of political reforms were reasons for Hailemariam's abrupt resignation last month.
Abiye will become Africa's youngest leader, half the age of Cameroon's Paul Biya, who is 85, and much younger than East Africa leaders such as Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, who is 73.
He served in the military for a decade after joining the EPRDF rebels at the tail end of the rule of Derg leader Mengistu Haile Mariam, who was toppled in 1991.
CLOSED SYSTEM
The new prime minister's background as a party insider could allow him to push reforms. ""Abiye has an opportunity to enact change from within as it is a closed system where the line between the civilian and security components is blurred,"" said political analyst Berouk Mesfin.
Abiye co-founded the Information Network Security Agency, which conducts online surveillance of citizens, and served as its deputy chairman until 2010.
He also faces the task of further democratizing a country long accused by rights groups of clamping down on dissent. 
Since January, the government has released thousands of dissidents to placate simmering anger, but it re-introduced a state of emergency the day after Hailemariam resigned. Laws curbing civil society and the press remain.
Abiye must also grapple with unemployment in a country where at least 70 percent of the population is below the age of 30.
Even the officially sanctioned press has not pulled its punches about the difficulties ahead.

""It is incumbent on the incoming premier and his administration to be cognizant of the specter of catastrophe hanging over Ethiopia and do whatever is necessary to provide the kind of leadership which pulls the nation back from the brink,"" the Addis Ababa-based Reporter said this month.

291,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>",Austrian far right comes off worse after coalition's first 100 days,"By Francois Murphy
VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria's government, the only one in Western Europe to include the far right, has spent much of its first 100 days dealing with anti-Semitism scandals and other unforeseen headwinds but only the anti-immigrant Freedom Party has suffered damage so far.
After an election dominated by Europe's migration crisis, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conservatives and the Freedom Party (FPO) have stuck to their hard line on immigration, pledging to cut benefits for refugees and workers' children living abroad.
But unscripted incidents have been piling up, from allegations of an FPO-driven purge at a domestic intelligence agency to unexpectedly stiff opposition to the government's plans to allow smoking in bars and restaurants.
So far, the 31-year-old Kurz has stayed largely on-message, if slightly withdrawn, while most of the blame for recent setbacks has stuck to the FPO, costing it support both in regional elections and national opinion polls. 
""The FPO grew up as an opposition party,"" political analyst Anton Pelinka said. ""As a government party they are certainly going to have to suffer heavy losses. That is already becoming clear.""
During more than a decade in opposition the FPO presented itself as the only alternative to the Alpine republic's tradition of centrist coalitions like the last one, between Kurz's People's Party (OVP) and the Social Democrats.
While it has only lost a few points in polls since securing 26 percent in October's parliamentary election, the FPO has failed to match that score in all three provincial votes this year. Polls show support for the OVP unchanged at about 32 percent. 
A cartoon this month in the Oberoesterreichische Nachrichten newspaper illustrated the mood, showing a suited Kurz walking on water while FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache was neck-deep in it, arms flailing from his life jacket.
The FPO has certainly been in more hot water than Kurz and his party.
An anti-Semitism affair that has engulfed two right-wing fraternities close to the FPO prompted the party to set up a committee of historians to examine its past - an effort that Austria's Jewish community views with scepticism.
The FPO also championed the right to smoke in bars and restaurants, spurring more than half a million people to sign a petition calling for a smoking ban, embarrassing a party that has simultaneously called for more direct democracy.
Strache also had to pay 10,000 euros ($12,350) in damages and issue a public apology to settle a defamation case brought by Austria's top news anchor after he posted a message on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) accusing him and state broadcaster ORF of lying. 
STRATEGIC SILENCE
But there is no sign so far that voters, many of whom had grown tired of bickering, often dysfunctional centrist coalitions, blame Kurz for bringing the FPO into government. 
And although allegations of a purge by the FPO interior minister at the BVT intelligence agency have caused tension, the two parties and their leaders have largely avoided public disputes, in contrast to previous governments.
""Despite several potential conflicts they have been able to avoid open discord,"" political analyst Thomas Hofer said. ""The crisis management has been good."" 
Kurz's public comments have been so disciplined that he has been mocked for being too cautious or even silent. A satirical website said the late British physicist Stephen Hawking had bequeathed his speech synthesizer to Kurz to enable him ""to communicate with the outside world again"".
That criticism appears confined to the Vienna bubble for the time being. 
Economic growth in the affluent European Union country of 10 million people has picked up and is projected to reach around 3 percent this year, giving the government some fiscal leeway. 
It plans to cut taxes and balance the budget next year but has so far shied away from serious structural reform. And it could ultimately be judged on whether it lives up to pledges to overhaul the public sector that have largely yet to be clearly defined. 
""For the moment that is evidently still working - being popular without saying anything of substance,"" Pelinka said. ""How long can that last? Certainly not forever. But it could be one, two, three years.""

EDINBURGH/MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan academic Clara Ponsati, accused by Spain of rebellion for her role in Catalonia's independence campaign, was granted bail by a Scottish court on Wednesday as she battles extradition, saying she was the object of political persecution. 
Ponsati, a former Catalan education minister who is currently a professor at Scotland's University of St Andrews, is one of the Catalan leaders being sought by the Spanish courts for organizing a referendum on independence in October last year that was deemed illegal under Spanish law.
Also among them is the former head of the regional government, Carles Puigdemont, who has been detained in Germany. In a symbolic gesture of support, Catalonia's parliament on Wednesday said it backed his right to again lead the region.
As Ponsati handed herself in at a Scottish police station to face charges which also include one of misuse of public funds over the banned independence vote, her lawyer said Ponsati believed she would not get a fair trial in Spain. 
""Clara remains defiant, resolute and is determined to fight back,"" her lawyer Aamer Anwar said. ""She does not believe that the Spanish courts can guarantee independence, human rights or justice.""

He read a statement which also thanked Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon, herself a supporter of independence for Scotland from the United Kingdom, saying Scotland had been ""a true friend to Catalonia in her darkest hours"".
Ponsati was later freed on bail at Edinburgh Sheriff Court, leaving to cheers from a throng of supporters outside waving the ""estelada"" Catalan independence flag. 
""Clara wishes for me to state that these charges are politically motivated and a grotesque distortion of the truth. She cannot believe that she is being held responsible for the violence that took place on the day of the referendum,"" Anwar said outside court. 
""She believes ... the only people that should be held responsible for the brutal violence (are) the Spanish police and the 6,000 state security forces who attacked the Catalan people on behalf of the Spanish government."" 
Ponsati's next hearing was set for April 12. A crowdfunding page set up to pay her legal costs has already raised 165,000 pounds ($232,600).
The Spanish government denies it is prosecuting the Catalan separatists for their political beliefs and says their actions violated the Spanish constitution. A Spanish justice ministry official was not available to comment on the latest development.
Those facing charges of rebellion could be jailed for up to 25 years if convicted.
Following the banned referendum in October and a subsequent declaration of independence by the Catalan parliament, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dismissed the assembly and took direct control of the rich northwestern region.
The political crisis is one of Spain's most serious since the country returned to democracy in the 1970s.
Puigdemont, who has been living in self-imposed exile in Belgium, was arrested in Germany on Sunday, sparking protests on Barcelona's streets. He is being held in prison pending an extradition hearing in a German court.
Spanish national police said on Wednesday that two Catalan regional officers who were traveling with him had also been arrested. The detentions formed part of an investigation into a crime of concealment, police said on Twitter.
Despite his detention, the separatist-controlled Catalan parliament on Wednesday defended Puigdemont's right to be a candidate again to head the regional government.
The declaration had the support of separatist parties Junts per Catalunya, Esquerra Republicana and the CUP, who together won a slim majority of votes in a December regional election.
Spain's Constitutional Court has said that Puigdemont or any other candidate could only become regional leader if he was physically present in parliament and had a judge's permission to attend.
""The Spanish justice system's interference has forced him (Puigdemont) to provisionally renounce his candidacy but we will not give up,"" Gemma Geis, regional parliament member of Junts per Catalunya, said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - After most European Union states expelled Russian diplomats over the Salisbury spy poisoning, sources in Brussels expect the bloc to hold the line on Russia sanctions for now. 
EU foreign ministers will discuss the bloc's troubled ties with Moscow on April 16, a broad debate planned long before a former Russian spy was found slumped on a public bench together with his daughter in the English town of Salisbury on March 4.
But, diplomats and officials said, any appetite that might have been there at the turn of the year to soften the bloc's line and seek more ""selective engagement"" with Moscow has dissipated after the toxin attack, which Britain, followed by the rest of the EU, blames on Moscow. [nL8N1R84DY]
""Just several weeks ago, the Austrians were ready to join the traditional Russia doves in asking for more engagement with Russia. Now, that would not be possible,"" said a senior diplomat from a country traditionally hawkish on Moscow. 
The West responded to the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia by expelling more than 100 Russians as undercover spies, including 60 sent home from the United States.
Nineteen of the EU's 28 states have told Russian diplomats to leave, and three others recalled their own ambassadors. Only Greece, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Portugal, Slovenia and Austria have not joined the coordinated action.
The biggest Western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the height of the Cold War came days after the fourth anniversary of Moscow's military annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine.
Back then, the EU responded by slapping sanctions on Russia, which it stepped up as Moscow backed rebels in east Ukraine. They include curbs on doing business and a blacklist of officials.
""The ball is now in Moscow's court, we'll see if they respond by kicking out as many EU diplomats,"" said another senior EU person. ""We will discuss accordingly but there seems to be no appetite to reopen the economic sanctions.""
An EU official dealing with the matter said the expulsions already establish an EU ""red line"", meaning the bloc would not go any further for now.
The EU's economic sanctions, which target Russia's energy, defense and financial sectors, are in place until the end of July any an extension requires unanimity of all 28 EU states.
Despite the bloc's traditional split on how to handle Russia, most recently seen in a clash between two of the bloc's top officials on whether to congratulate Vladimir Putin on his fourth presidential term, the sanctions have been extended every six months since first being imposed in mid-2014.
The sources said the bloc could consider smaller changes to the sanctions regime, either looking at longer extensions of one year, or adding a few names to the EU's blacklist over Russia's presidential elections earlier this month, which were also held in the annexed Crimea.
But mostly they expected no substantial changes from the April meeting, with another senior EU diplomat saying: ""We have sent a very clear and strong signal. Now we sit and wait to see what happens next.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - The world body linking national parliaments called on authorities in Venezuela on Wednesday to halt ""harassment"" of opposition MPs and efforts to undermine and usurp the powers of the opposition-led National Assembly.
The opposition in 2015 won a broad majority in the legislative elections, but President Nicolas Maduro's allies on the Supreme Court stripped it of many of its powers and systematically shot down every piece of legislation it approved. 
Maduro last year led the creation of a legislative superbody called the Constituent Assembly, which has no formal checks on its powers. Its creation led many countries around the world to describe Maduro as a dictator, a charge he dismisses as part of a campaign against him by the United States.
The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), whose general assembly in Geneva this week was attended by 147 parliamentary delegations, recognizes the National Assembly and not the Constituent Assembly.
In a statement, the IPU's Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians denounced ""the scale of ongoing efforts, with apparent immunity, to repress opposition members and undermine the integrity and autonomy of the National Assembly of Venezuela."" 
It had received credible and serious allegations of human rights violations affecting 57 Venezuelan parliamentarians from the coalition of the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD). ""Since March 2017, close to 40 parliamentarians were attacked with impunity by law enforcement officers and pro-government supporters during demonstrations"", it said.
In Caracas, Venezuelan authorities did not respond to a request for comment.
Last week the International Labour Organization (ILO) launched a commission of inquiry into complaints that Venezuela is violating standards including freedom of association and workers' rights to organize.
""In Venezuela these days, they are moving from crisis to crisis,"" Martin Chungong, IPU President, told a news briefing. 
""The legitimately elected parliamentary institution is being subverted - the National Assembly that was elected by the people - is being subverted by an institution that is not largely recognized internationally, the Constituent Assembly,"" he said.
The Venezuelan delegation to the IPU assembly was composed of parliamentarians from the National Assembly.
""Many of them expressed the concern that when they return to Venezuela they might be arrested at the airport on account of their participation in this meeting,"" Chungong said.
""So far, I think that the Venezuelan authorities have not gone that far as to really arrest systematically members of parliament,"" he added. ""But given what is happening in the country, you cannot rule that possibility out.""

KIGALI (Reuters) - Rwandan authorities on Wednesday sold assets belonging to the family of a woman who was barred from standing against President Paul Kagame at an election last year and then jailed pending trial for alleged incitement to insurrection.
The sale is a fresh blow to Diane Rwigara, who has accused Kagame of stifling dissent and criticized his Rwandan Patriotic Front's grip on the country since it fought its way to power to end a genocide in 1994.
The revenue authority sold the stock of Premier Tobacco Company owned by Rwigara's family to another tobacco company for around 500 million Rwandan francs ($577,842.29) and said it was recovering unpaid back taxes.
Rwigara's sister Anne said the auction and the charges of incitement and forgery aim to punish the family because Rwigara challenged Kagame and to deter other potential opponents.
She also said the company's stock is worth about 1 billion francs. This year the family filed a court case saying the revenue authority illegally seized company assets.
""This is banditry in a country of so called rule of law. Since the 1980s our father worked hard to get this factory. Over 35 years of hard work and now in three hours you take it away,"" Anne Rwigara told a court bailiff and tax body officials.
The revenue authority's director general Richard Tusabe told Reuters the auction was legal and not politically motivated.
""There are more assets to be sold. We need to sell more to recover government funds. The key is to recover government funds,"" he said.
Kagame won international credit for restoring stability in Rwanda and presiding over a rapid economic recovery after the genocide, in which an estimated 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and politically moderate ethnic Hutus were killed.
Human rights groups and some others say he has muzzled independent media and suppressed potential democratic opponents. Kagame won the August election with 98.8 percent of the vote.

GAZA (Reuters) - A small group of Palestinian women in Gaza are stretching their limbs with yoga to help them teach others to cope with the stresses and traumas of living in the embattled territory.
The Gaza Strip, which is dominated by the Islamist Hamas faction, has experienced three wars with neighboring Israel in the past 11 years.
There are few recreational activities for women in the densely-populated enclave of two million people, which is under a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt and has the highest unemployment rate on earth.
Amal Khayal, who teaches the class in a makeshift gym and also heads women's activities for Italian charity Cooperazione Internazionale Sud Sud (CISS), said the project was aimed at training some 30 women to teach.
""We are trying to use physical activities to help release psychological pressures so that women here can form a support network for one another,"" Khayal told Reuters during one of her classes.
Some of the participants are also involved in learning juggling. Nineteen will become yoga instructors and 13 will learn to teach circus tricks, Khayal said, adding that more women had expressed a wish to participate in future classes. 

""Everyone in Gaza, specially women, needs yoga because we live in a tough place. There are no entertainment facilities where we can unload our depressions which come in addition to our daily life issues,"" said Amina Al-Zraiay, a sports teacher and occupational therapist.

The 34-year-old man ran the website from Hungary to serve German clients from May to November 2016 before it was shut down, the prosecutor's office said.
An internet search showed the website offered ""first class and discretely delivered"" ammunition and guns such as pistols and Kalashnikovs to clients ""without troublesome bureaucratic hurdles or annoying paperwork"".
Hungarian authorities raided two sites in Budapest and the city of Barcs on Wednesday, seizing data and other evidence, the prosecutor's office said, adding that the man was suspected of 193 cases of illegal arms sales.
The investigation had been under way since 2016, when German magazine Focus reported that the suspect was operating ""Anonymous.Kollektiv"", a far-right anti-immigration website that had nearly 2 million followers on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The page has since been deleted.
German authorities have sought to crack down on attacks against immigrants which have increased since the influx of over a million mostly Muslim migrants beginning in 2015. 
There were more than 2,000 attacks against migrants in 2017, ranging from physical assault to serious property damage, the German interior ministry said in February. It was not clear how many of the attacks involved weapons.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A South African court jailed a white woman on Wednesday for yelling racist abuse at a black policeman, in a case that laid bare attitudes that endure more than two decades after the end of apartheid.
In a ruling that lawyers believed to be the first prison term imposed in South Africa for verbal racial abuse, estate agent Vicki Momberg was sentenced to three years, with one year suspended, for directing deeply offensive slurs at the officer.
Previously people convicted of the same crime have been fined.
A video clip went viral following the incident in 2016 when the policeman tried to help Momberg after thieves broke into her car at night at a shopping center.
It showed her saying she wanted to be helped by a white or ethnic Indian officer, and that black people were ""plain and simple useless"" and ""they are clueless, clueless"".
In her rant, she several times called the policeman a ""kaffir"", apartheid-era slang for a black person and one of the worst terms of hate speech in South Africa.
Momberg wiped away tears as judge Pravina Rugoonandan read the ruling in a Johannesburg court, finding her guilty on four counts. Momberg's lawyer Kevin Lawlor said she will seek the right to appeal her sentence.
The episode highlighted how 24 years after Nelson Mandela became South Africa's first black president, espousing reconciliation, it is still struggling with race relations.
Despite the emergence of a black middle class, income gaps remain clearly visible along race lines, fuelling perceptions of white privilege. Black people make up 80 percent of South Africa's 54 million population, but most its wealth remains in the hands of whites, who account for about 8 percent.
Justice Minister Michael Masutha said the custodial sentence could ""serve as a deterrent"" to others. ""It was a question of escalating and intensifying the fight against racism by finding even more sterner measures,"" he told eNCA television.
Johannesburg-based criminal lawyer Zola Majavu, who was not involved in the case, said: ""This case has been put on the spotlight, it may be the first time - at least that I'm aware of - that a person has been sentenced to jail without the option of a fine for such action."" 
However, in October, two white farmers who had been filmed pushing a wailing black man into a coffin were sentenced to jail for attempted murder, assault and kidnapping. 
In 2016, a court ordered Penny Sparrow, a white woman, to pay 150,000 rand ($9,941) to charity after she was found guilty of hate speech for referring to blacks as ""monkeys"" in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.

302,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",Russia says it will respond in kind to West's expulsions,"By Christian Lowe and Katya Golubkova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Wednesday it would respond in kind to the mass expulsion of Russian diplomats by the West over the poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in the English city of Salisbury.
What began as a row between London and Moscow after Britain accused Russia of using a nerve agent to poison Skripal and his daughter has now snowballed into an international chorus of rebuke for the Kremlin, with even some friendly governments ejecting Russian diplomats.
Adding to the list on Wednesday, Slovakia, Malta and Luxembourg each recalled their ambassador in Moscow for consultations, while Montenegro said it would expel a Russian diplomat. Slovakia and Montenegro, while both members of the U.S.-led NATO alliance, are traditionally close to Russia.
The biggest demarche came from the United States, which on Monday said it was expelling 60 Russian diplomats. That dented Russian President Vladimir Putin's hopes of forging a friendly relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Valentina Matviyenko, a Kremlin loyalist and speaker of the upper house of parliament, said Russia would retaliate.
""Without a doubt, Russia, as is diplomatic practice, will respond symmetrically and observe parity when it comes to the number of diplomats,"" RIA news agency quoted her as saying.
Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said a Russian military aircraft had, for the first time since the Cold War, conducted a training flight via the North Pole to North America, RIA news agency reported. 
There was no immediate indication that the flight was linked to Russia's standoff with the West. The U.S. navy is holding a five-week training exercise in the Arctic Circle. 
COLD WAR ECHOES
In total, more than 100 Russian diplomats are to be sent home from states ranging from Denmark to Australia, the biggest Western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the height of the Cold War.
Moscow has denied being behind the attack on the Skripals and says its adversaries are using it to whip up a campaign of ""Russophobia.""
Skripal, 66, a double agent who was swapped in a spy exchange deal in 2010 and went to live in England, and Yulia Skripal, 33, were found unconscious on a public bench in a shopping center in Salisbury on March 4. They remain critically ill in hospital from the attack in which, British authorities say, a Soviet-era nerve toxin called Novichok was used.
Russia has already expelled 23 British diplomats, a tit-for-tat response to Britain's expulsion of the same number of staff at the Russian embassy in London.
Adding to a drum beat of tough rhetoric coming from Moscow and London, the Russian foreign ministry raised the prospect British intelligence services had poisoned Skripal and his daughter. 
""If convincing evidence to the contrary is not presented to the Russian side we will consider that we are dealing with an attempt on the lives of our citizens,"" the ministry said in a statement.
In Australia, whose government said on Tuesday it would expel two diplomats, the Russian ambassador, Grigory Loginov, told reporters the world will enter into a ""Cold War situation"" if the West persists with its bias against Russia.
Two days after the United States announced the expulsion of Russian diplomats, there was still no sign of how exactly Russian planned to respond - an indication, perhaps, that the scale of the Western action caught Moscow off guard.
Interfax news agency quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov as saying Moscow would assess the level of hostility in Washington and London before deciding how to retaliate.

The civilians were killed by rebels from a Ugandan Islamist group called the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) during a raid on the city of Beni late on Tuesday, Mayor Nyonyi Bwanakawa told Reuters. 
The Center of Study for the Promotion of Peace, Democracy and Human Rights, a local activist group, also said ADF rebels had killed 11 civilians, mostly with machetes and hachets. 
The government and United Nations have blamed the spree of massacres near Beni since 2014, most carried out with crude weapons, on the ADF but independent experts say some Congolese soldiers have also been involved.
Beni is one of several hotspots in eastern and central Congo where mounting violence has raised fears the massive Central African country could slide back into civil war. 
Militia violence has spiked since President Joseph Kabila refused to step down at the end of his mandate in 2016 and it is unclear if a presidential vote to replace him will be held this December as scheduled. 
Local army spokesman Mak Hazukay said the military had attacked armed groups on Tuesday and that troops were now targeting ADF strongholds in Virunga National Park, near the border with Uganda. 
Congo and Uganda launched a joint military offensive against the ADF in January after the group was blamed for killing 15 Tanzanian peacekeepers during an attack in December.
The United Nations last month expressed concern for civilians caught in the midst of the campaign, saying nearly 370,000 people could be forced to flee their homes.
Tuesday's attack came the on same day the U.N. Security Council renewed for a year its Congo peacekeeping mission, which was first deployed during a 1998-2003 war that killed millions of people, most from hunger and disease.

Freeman Mbowe, chairman of the main opposition CHADEMA party, was charged with five other senior party leaders at a court in Dar es Salaam on Tuesday, court documents showed.
The opposition leaders, four of whom are members of parliament, were detained at a remand prison until a court rules on their bail applications on Thursday.They were also charged with taking part in an illegal demonstration in Dar es Salaam in February that led to the death of a student, who was allegedly killed by a stray bullet while police engaged in a street battle with rioters.
The others arraigned in court were CHADEMA secretary general Vincent Mashinji, deputy secretary general John Mnyika, deputy secretary general Salum Mwalim, Peter Msigwa and Esther Matiko.
Other opposition parties said the arraignment was part of an ongoing crackdown on democracy by President John Magufuli's government.""It is a new normal, a fearful nation,"" tweeted Zitto Kabwe, leader of the opposition ACT Wazalendo party.
The opposition says tolerance for dissent has diminished rapidly since Magufuli took office in late 2015 with pledges to reform the East African nation and curb corruption.  Two opposition leaders, including a lawmaker, were sentenced to five months in prison last month for insulting Magufuli. The United States, European Union and several Western embassies last month voiced concern over politics-related violence and allegations of human rights abuses.

The Paris-based Kristeva, now 76, is the author of more than 30 books and worked alongside other leading French intellectuals such as Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan and Roland Barthes.
The Bulgarian commission which identifies people who worked for the communist-era secret services said Kristeva had worked, under the code name ""Sabina"", as a collaborator for the first department of the State Security agency. The department oversaw intelligence in the area of the arts and mass media.
It said she began working for the State Security organization in 1971. She had moved to Paris in 1965 on a French government scholarship. The document did not say how long she worked for State Security or whether she received any payment.
Kristeva was not immediately available to comment on the matter.
In its heyday Bulgaria's State Security, working closely with the Soviet KGB, operated a network of some 100,000 agents and informers. It was dissolved in 1989 following the collapse of the communist regime.
The issue of access to, and publication of, its files has continued to raise powerful emotions in Bulgaria during its difficult transition to democracy.
Foreign Policy magazine has ranked Kristev as one of the 100 greatest thinkers of the 20th century. As well as books on psychoanalysis and philosophy, she has written extensively on cultural and feminist issues and is also a novelist.

BRUSSELS/PARIS (Reuters) - France, Britain and Germany sought on Wednesday to persuade their EU partners to back new sanctions on Iran to preserve a nuclear deal with Tehran that U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to pull out of in May, diplomats said.
The new measures proposed by London, Paris and Berlin were discussed by the EU's 28 ambassadors and could include members of Iran's most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), diplomats said.
Trump has given the European signatories a May 12 deadline to ""fix the terrible flaws"" of the 2015 nuclear deal, which was agreed under his predecessor Barack Obama, or he will refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief on Iran.
The European Union rejects those criticisms. But Britain, France and Germany hope their steps could encourage Trump to issue new waivers preventing U.S. sanctions lifted under the deal from being reimposed next month. 
In Brussels at the closed-door meeting, the three pushed for agreement on possible travel bans and asset freezes before a foreign ministers' meeting next month, four diplomats told Reuters. Some EU capitals said they need more time, and discussions are expected to continue next week.
A total of 15 Iranian individuals and companies are on a list circulated to EU governments, but there was no direct discussion of names at Wednesday's meeting, one diplomat said.
Britain, France and Germany have proposed the extra EU sanctions over Iran's ballistic missile programmes and its role in the war in Syria, according to a document seen by Reuters. 
Diplomats pointed to the next EU foreign ministers' meeting in Luxembourg on April 16, the last formal gathering on the EU agenda before Trump's May deadline, although governments can always convene other sessions. 
""The idea is to have a final decision on Iran sanctions by or at the April Foreign Affairs Council,"" the diplomat said.
But another diplomat said: ""It will be complicated because this will need time to convince the member states.""
The sanctions would not involve measures that were lifted under the nuclear deal but would instead target individual Iranians that the EU believes are behind Iran's ballistic weapons and its support for the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which is also subject to sanctions.
Any Iranians targeted would be subject to asset freezes and bans on travelling to the EU or doing business with companies based in the bloc.
SOME EU NATIONS WARY
EU envoys discussed possible sanctions on the basis of last week's meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, who agreed that Iran needed to be held to account for its role in Syria's seven-year war, even while upholding the Iran nuclear accord. 
At that meeting, France also urged the EU to consider new sanctions on Iran, citing publicly the ""proliferation of ballistic missiles and (Tehran's) very questionable role in the near- and Middle East.""
But countries ranging from Sweden and Ireland to Iran's closest European allies Italy and Greece still need to be convinced. Austria is also wary, one diplomat said.
Given strong EU support for the nuclear deal, signed by the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France, Germany, the European Union and Iran, many governments are wary of doing anything that might jeopardise it.
Any EU-wide measures would be the first significant punitive steps since the bloc lifted broad economic sanctions on Iran last year following the accord to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions for at least a decade. 
Ballistic missiles fired by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi militia killed a man in Riyadh on Sunday. 
Iran says its missiles are purely defensive weapons.

It has given no indication that it would walk away from the nuclear deal due to the proposed new sanctions, which are minor compared with the broad sanctions lifted as part of the deal.

QUEBEC CITY (Reuters) - A former Canadian university student has pleaded guilty to killing six men who were praying in a Quebec City mosque in January 2017, a court said on Wednesday, averting a trial in one of the country’s rare mass shootings.
Alexandre Bissonnette, 28, handcuffed and wearing leg irons as he entered the Quebec City courtroom, had asked on Monday to change his previous plea of not guilty. 
Quebec Superior Court Justice François Huot accepted the new plea on Wednesday after taking steps to ensure Bissonnette understood the consequences of professing his guilt.
Speaking to the courtroom, which included members of the mosque, the Centre Culturel Islamique de Québec, Bissonnette asked the victims' families for forgiveness and said he decided to plead guilty to spare them the hardship of a trial.
“I would like to ask forgiveness for all that I have done,"" he said. “If at least by pleading guilty I can do a little good in all this, that would be something.""
Bissonnette did not explain why he had targeted the mosque but said he had held ""suicidal thoughts"" and an ""obsession"" with death. 
“I am not a terrorist, nor an Islamophobe,"" he said.
The judge declared him guilty on six counts of first-degree murder and six counts of attempted murder.
Congregants gathered at the courthouse said they were relieved to avoid a lengthy trial, but that it would be difficult for families to forgive Bissonnette.
“Our people are still in a state of shock. The sentence has to be pronounced. A lot of things have to happen,” outgoing mosque president Mohamed Labadi told reporters. “There is still a deep sadness, even though he has admitted his guilt.”
The slightly built, dark-haired Bissonnette looked down and at times wiped away tears as the judge read out the names of the mosque shooting victims. 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau initially described the shooting as a terrorist attack, although prosecutors did not charge Bissonnette with terrorism.
Police have described him as a “lone wolf” attacker. 
Mass shootings are rare in Canada, where gun control laws are stricter than in the United States.

Shoigu, addressing senior military commanders, was quoted as saying the flight had been carried out by Russian anti-submarine aircraft.
He did not say when the flight took place, but his announcement coincides with a major naval exercise by the United States and Britain in the Arctic Circle, and at time of heightened East-West tensions over the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain. 
The U.S.-led drills, called Exercise 18 (ICEX), are being co-ordinated by the U.S. Navy's Arctic Submarine Laboratory and involve Britain's HMS Trenchant and two U.S. submarines, the USS Connecticut and the USS Hartford.
Britain has billed the exercise as an opportunity for its submariners to learn and develop skills to operate under the Arctic ice cap.
Russia, in the midst of a major rearmament program, has embarked upon its biggest military push in the Arctic -- beefing up its military presence and capabilities -- since the 1991 Soviet fall. 
The Arctic is estimated to hold more hydrocarbon reserves than Saudi Arabia and Russia.

His arrest in Germany on Sunday threatens to worsen the crisis that flared last year when Catalonia unilaterally declared independence, prompting Madrid to dismiss Puigdemont's government and impose direct rule.[nL8N1R7096]
The separatist-controlled Catalan parliament's purely symbolic declaration of support for Puigdemont shows how powerless pro-independence parties have become as the legal noose tightens around their leaders, who are almost all either in exile or behind bars ahead of trial.
Spain's Supreme Court ruled on Friday to try Puigdemont and 24 other Catalan leaders for rebellion, embezzlement or disobeying the state for holding an October referendum on independence in Catalonia, deemed illegal by Spanish courts.
The court reactivated international arrest warrants for Puigdemont and four other politicians who went into self-imposed exile last year.
One of the four, Clara Ponsati, a former Catalan government member and now an academic in Scotland, turned herself in at a Edinburgh police station on Wednesday to fight her extradition. [nL8N1RA2FT]
Puigdemont's arrest, after crossing into Germany from Denmark, triggered demonstrations on Barcelona's streets on Sunday that left dozens injured in clashes with riot police. Protesters blockaded several motorways across Catalonia on Monday.
The Catalan parliament failed last week to elect a new president, as the hard-line separatist CUP party abstained, prolonging the region's political limbo. The parliament now has two months to try again before it must call a regional election.
Separatist parties on Wednesday defended Puigdemont's right to be a candidate to again head the Catalan government, but given his arrest in Germany that would be highly unlikely.
Spain's Constitutional Court has said that Puigdemont or any other candidate could only become regional leader if he was physically present in parliament and had a judge's permission to attend.
Wednesday's declaration had the support of separatist parties Junts per Catalunya, Esquerra Republicana and the CUP, who together won a slim majority of votes in a December regional election.
""The Spanish justice system's interference has forced him (Puigdemont) to provisionally renounce his candidacy but we will not give up,"" Gemma Geis, regional parliament member of Junts per Catalunya, said. 
Puigdemont could take his case to Germany's highest court, which in 2005 blocked the extradition to Spain on an EU arrest warrant of a German-Syrian al-Qaeda suspect.

For now, he could remain in custody for up to 90 days while he awaits the German court's decision.

The dispute over Miguna Miguna is part of a wider tussle between the government and the judiciary and it could also strain relations that have recently improved between President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga.
The two leaders announced on March 9 they would set aside years of acrimony and work together to unite Kenya, which is divided along political and ethnic lines in the wake of elections last year in which around 100 people were killed. 
The surprise announcement promised a fresh start for politics in Kenya, a country that is east Africa's richest economy and a hub for diplomacy, trade and security.
Authorities deported Miguna in February saying he had rescinded his citizenship.
He was also charged with treason because of his role in a mock swearing-in ceremony for Odinga in January that was a direct challenge to Kenyatta, who won a second term in October.
Police detained Miguna on Monday at the main airport in the capital as he returned after a court ruled that he should be allowed back into Kenya. The court ordered Miguna, the interior minister and the police chief to appear before it.
There was no immediate comment from the police on Wednesday as to why Miguna was not brought to court.

""The court should bite those disobeying court orders harder,"" James Orengo, a senator and lawyer for Miguna, told the court. Government critics say authorities defy court orders in cases involving politics and opposition politicians.

312,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 09:34AM ET</span>",One displaced family's return to Mosul,"MOSUL, Iraq (Reuters) - For Mohammed Saleh Ahmed and his family, returning to Mosul after more than a year away was bittersweet.
He was happy to return to a semblance of his old life, but leaving behind the friends he'd made in the refugee camp where he'd lived for a year weighed on him.
Ever since Mohammed fled Mosul in March 2017, this community of friends and relatives - a group of like-minded survivors of the battle for Mosul - had made life bearable. 
""It's so hard saying goodbye,"" Mohammed said, as he finished boxing up his belongings in his tent in the Hammam al-Alil refugee camp south of Mosul. 
Mohammed arrived when U.S.-led coalition forces began their advance on western Mosul, the final stretch to route Islamic State. The militants had overrun Mosul in 2014 and placed people like Mohammed under their draconian rule.
Carrying whatever he could, he fled his home in the city, along with his wife and five children. His parents and siblings were not far behind. 
A year ago, the Ahmed family did not think they'd be returning to Mosul so soon. But when they got the opportunity, they jumped at the chance. 
A few days after deciding to leave, neighbors and relatives came to help them load their belongings onto the small truck that would start the next chapter of their lives.
Mohammed's father and mother were going, too. Mirroring the heavy mood as they said goodbye, his father, Saleh, brought out an MP3 player and played old Iraqi folk songs, amid tearful goodbyes and promises to their come back and visit soon. 
In Mosul, they were greeted by Mohammed's older brother, Ahmed, who had persuaded them to move back by finding them a modest two-room house to rent. 
As the men carried things inside the house, Mohammed's wife Iman, immediately set about preparing the family's first meal in their new home. His parents, who moved in with Mohammed's family, celebrated their return over tea.
Though rudimentary, their new house was a step up from life in the camps, with a separate kitchen and makeshift bathroom, and the Ahmed family quickly settled into a new routine.
Before finding a job working at his uncle's construction company, Mohammed busied himself by going to the market, getting a haircut and taking his children to a recently reopened amusement park. And he took Iman to buy some new clothes. 
""New clothes for our new life,"" he said, as the couple wondered through the market picking out dresses.
In the time that the Ahmed family was away from Mosul, the nine-month campaign to rout the militants culminated in a brutal battle in the heart of its Old City, the centuries-old historic district that is Mosul’s beating heart. 
Though Islamic State was defeated, the western half of the city, where Mohammed grew up, was largely flattened. Seeing it for the first time, Mohammed was shocked by the what it's become. 

""I hardly recognize anything anymore,"" Mohammed said as he walked around with his older brother Ahmed.

In its 2017 annual report, RVRN said the living conditions of refugees and migrants on Greek islands, where thousands are stranded in dire, overcrowded camps, drove xenophobic rhetoric in local communities, sometimes with ""extreme manifestations.""
It found violent assaults had increased in Athens too, and said perpetrators appeared to execute instructions given to them by their organizations based on pre-meditated plans.
""The RVRN alarmingly observes an increase in the number of assaults committed by groups employing 'hit-and-run' like practices,"" the report said.
On the island of Leros, asylum-seekers reported they had been attacked by groups of motorcyclists using sharp objects. One pregnant woman said she was targeted because of her headscarf. In Athens, one man was verbally abused and beaten in the face at a bus stop, the report said.
RVRN, established in 2011 by the U.N. refugee agency in Greece and the National Commission for Human Rights, gives a broad definition of racist violence as ""criminal or violent acts or behavior against people because of their ethnic origin, color, religion, gender identity, sexual preferences or disabilities.""
On the basis of interviews with victims, it recorded 102 incidents of such violence in 2017, more than a third of which resulted in injury. That was up from 95 incidents in 2016.
Most of the attacks were against lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, transgender or intersex (LGBQTI) people, followed by those against refugees or migrants, which made up a third of all attacks. The number of attacks against LGBQTI people fell compared with the previous year.
Hostility toward migrants and refugees has risen in Greece since it plunged into an economic crisis in 2010. Actual numbers are likely to be higher than those reported as victims are sometimes too scared to report attacks to the police.

ACCRA (Reuters) - Thousands of people protested in Ghana's capital Accra on Wednesday against the expansion of its defense cooperation with the United States, in a rare public display of opposition to the growing foreign military presence in West Africa.
Demonstrators blowing vuvuzelas and beating drums filled Accra's business district, holding placards criticizing a new deal with Washington that they say threatens Ghana's sovereignty.
""As a right-thinking citizen, I am here to fight for my country. I am against selling our peace and security for $20 million,"" said Gifty Yankson, a 49-year-old trader.
""They (the American military) become a curse everywhere they are, and I am not ready to mortgage my security,"" Yankson said.
Police estimated the crowd size at about 3,500 protesters. While officers in riot gear were present, no violence was reported.
International powers including the United States and France are looking to extend their presence in the remote Sahel region in particular, where al Qaeda and Islamic State militants have gained a strong foothold in recent years.
But Washington is struggling to mend its image in Africa, which was damaged by reports President Donald Trump described African nations as ""shithole countries"" in a discussion on immigration. The White House later denied he used that language.
Under the deal approved by Ghana's parliament last week, the United States will invest around $20 million in training and equipment for the Ghanaian military this year. Opposition lawmakers boycotted the parliamentary vote.
In return, the U.S. military will be allowed to deploy troops and import military equipment tax-free, use an airport runway that meets U.S. standards, and have free access to Ghana's radio spectrum.
Ghana has had a long-standing military and trade ties with the United States, but many say the latest agreement was a step too far.
Responding to local press reports concerning the deal, the U.S. Embassy in Accra underscored in a statement last week that it had no plans to establish a military base in Ghana. 
It said the existing 20-year-old cooperation agreement ""does not cover the current range and volume of bilateral exercises and assistance.""
Four elite U.S. soldiers were killed in Niger alongside local troops in an Islamist ambush in October, sparking a fierce debate back home about covert U.S. actions in West Africa.

Memorial, which has angered authorities in the wider region by exposing rights abuses, believes it is being targeted by a campaign designed to drive it out. 
It said Sirajutdin Datsiev, who ran its office in Dagestan, had been struck hard on the back of a head with an unknown object by an attacker shortly after leaving his home in the city of Makhachkala on Wednesday morning. 
Datsiev had fallen to the floor, but had been unable to move his head and had therefore not seen his assailant, Memorial said in a statement, citing an unnamed eye witness as saying his attacker had jumped out of a car with tinted windows.
""We consider that the attack on Sirajutdin Datsiev was linked to his professional activity,"" Memorial said, saying the police were looking into the incident. 
In January, Memorial's office car in Dagestan was torched and employees received phone threats saying the office there would be set alight with them inside it.
Two masked men set fire to another Memorial office in nearby Ingushetia that same month, while police in Chechnya detained the head of its office there and accused him of possessing a large quantity of cannabis in what he said was a set-up. 
Both the United States and the European Union have expressed concern over Memorial's problems.

PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron led national tributes on Wednesday to the gendarme who switched places with a woman hostage during an attack on a supermarket in southern France last week and was killed by the Islamist gunman.
Colonel Arnaud Beltrame's heroism has helped reassure a nation left shaken and in mourning after Moroccan-born Radouane Lakdim's killing spree, an attack that rekindled a debate over how France deals with suspected militant Islamists.
Tributes began with a minute's silence in gendarme barracks across France, before Beltrame's Tricolor-draped coffin was carried into the cobbled courtyard of Les Invalides, a former military hospital, where Macron solemnly addressed the nation.
""To accept to die so the innocent can live: that is the essence of what it means to be a soldier,"" he said. ""Others, even many who are brave, would have wavered or hesitated.""
After speaking, Macron posthumously awarded Beltrame the Legion of Honour, France's highest order of merit. 
More than 240 people have been killed since early 2015 in France in attacks carried out by Islamist militants or individuals inspired by Islamist groups. Macron said France would prevail with calm against an ""insidious enemy"" that wanted to divide the French people and deprive them of their freedoms.
Lakdim's rampage began when he shot dead the occupant of a car he stole and fired on a group of police joggers, wounding one. He then headed to a supermarket in Trebes, east of the popular medieval tourist city of Carcassonne, where he killed an employee and a customer.
Beltrame, 44, led the team of gendarmes who arrived first on the scene. He persuaded Lakdim to release a woman he was holding as a human shield, laying down his weapon and putting his mobile phone on a table with the line surreptitiously left open. 
When three shots later rang out, elite police stormed the building and shot dead Lakdim. Beltrame was found with bullet wounds to an arm and foot and a grave knife wound to the neck. He died the following morning in hospital.
FRENCH STATE AND ISLAM
Colleagues of Beltrame have paid tribute to the gendarme's sense of duty, calmness under pressure and a generosity which inspired those serving beside him.
The attack has once again exposed secular France's struggle to integrate Europe's largest Muslim community and deal with the threat posed by home-grown militants and foreign jihadists.
""What we are fighting is clandestine Islamic fundamentalism, which spreads through social media, which does its work out of sight, which preys on weak and unstable minds, and which on our soil corrupts and indoctrinates on a daily basis,"" Macron said.
Lakdim had been on a government watch list - known as Fiche S - since 2014, suspected of links to a local Salafist network. But he had recently received a summons from the DGSI spy agency and was to be informed he was no longer viewed as a security risk, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said.[nL8N1R95K8]
Friday's attack was the first since Macron, in power since May, toughened security laws and lifted a two-year state of emergency. Right-wing political opponents have pressed Macron to deal firmly with radical preachers and Salafist mosques. 
Macron has pledged to redefine relations between Islam and the state to foster a more homegrown form of Islam that would better fit with France's firm separation of church and state.
Far-right party leader Marine Le Pen and opposition leader Laurent Wauquiez have both called for foreigners on the Fiche S list to be expelled and the most dangerous French nationals on the watch list to be imprisoned.

""We must fight our battle within the bounds of the law,"" Philippe told lawmakers on Tuesday.

KEMEROVO/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Funerals began in Russia on Wednesday of the 64 people, most of them children, whose deaths in a blaze at a Siberian shopping mall have roused public anger over official corruption and incompetence. 
Flags on government buildings across Russia flew at half mast, state TV and radio stations removed light entertainment shows from their schedules, and lawmakers in Moscow observed a minute of silence.
The fire at the Winter Cherry mall in the city of Kemerovo on Sunday killed 41 children. Investigators have not yet confirmed the cause of the fire, but the high death toll has been blamed on reported shortcomings in the mall's safety procedures.
At a funeral service in a Russian Orthodox church in Kemerovo, about 3,600 km (2,200 miles) east of Moscow, women wailed as prayers were sung over three coffins, including two small caskets for children.
Sergei and Natalia Agarkov were burying two school-age children, Konstantin and Maria. The children’s grandmother, Nadezhda Agarkova, was also killed. 
All three had gone to watch a film at a cinema on the top floor of the shopping center on Sunday, but had been unable to get out of the auditorium when the fire broke out. Russia media reported that the doors had been locked.
""This tragedy is made even worse by the fact that children became victims of the blaze. Great grief is upon all of us and there are no words that would express our common pain,"" the priest told the mourners, who held candles and repeatedly crossed themselves.
A day earlier President Vladimir Putin flew to Kemerovo and promised angry residents that those responsible for what he called criminal negligence would be punished and declared Wednesday a national day of mourning.
ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTEST
Investigators have said that the main theory they are looking into is that an electrical short circuit caused the fire. Another theory, which they say is less likely, is that the blaze began due to someone setting fire to something accidentally or deliberately. 
Although authorities say they have recovered all of the bodies from the charred remains of the mall, many of the corpses were so badly damaged by the fire that they can only be identified via DNA testing. A further 14 people remain in hospital.
Russia has rigorous fire safety rules and a system of regular inspections, but enforcement is undermined by endemic corruption which affects many aspects of life in the country of 144 million people.
Moscow reduced the number of inspections for certain types of businesses after complaints that inspectors were extorting bribes in exchange for turning a blind eye to violations.
But some business owners in Kemerovo said this meant that safety shortcomings were not being identified.
At least one vigil held in memory of the dead in cities across Russia has turned into an anti-government demonstration. 
At a Moscow gathering on Tuesday attended by several thousand people, including opposition leader Alexei Navalny, protesters held banners reading ""Bribes kill children"" and ""We demand a real investigation"".

Some chanted ""Putin - resign!"", ten days after Putin secured a comfortable election win for another six-year term in office.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union announced a plan on Wednesday to enable military personnel and equipment to be moved more quickly across Europe, which NATO sees as vital in the event of a conflict with Russia to overcome border delays and bridges too weak for tanks.
Russia's Zapad war games on NATO's eastern flank late last year raised alarm in Brussels and Washington that large-scale drills could accidentally trigger a conflict in eastern Europe but leave NATO unable to speedily mass troops there.
Conflicting regulations across 28 EU countries, bridges and tunnels too narrow or weak for heavy equipment and few special allowances for transfers of U.S. troops all make it difficult for NATO, commanders say.
""By facilitating military mobility within the EU, we can be more effective in preventing crises, more efficient in deploying our missions, and quicker in reacting when challenges arise,"" EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said of the so-called Action Plan on Military Mobility.
The plan will now go to EU governments and the European Parliament for discussion.
Following a pilot program last year to identify weak spots along North Sea-Baltic routes, where Russia regularly conducts military drills and has built up its air defenses in Kaliningrad, the European Commission will next year outline the best routes across Europe for military transport.
The Commission, which oversees the EU's common budget, will also look at areas to upgrade infrastructure and estimate costs, how to streamline customs procedures for munitions and dangerous goods, and seek better cooperation between EU agencies.
Easier diplomatic clearance is also needed.
The plan is a test both for the European Union's renewed efforts to coordinate on military matters and to work better with NATO, which has its own standards for military-strength bridges, roads, tunnels and airfields.
If the EU were to design its own system, that would create unnecessary duplication and likely anger the United States.
While Washington no longer has Cold War-levels of personnel stationed in Europe, it has begun returning tanks, troops and helicopters to Germany, Poland and the Baltics as part of the West's deterrent following Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.

Before retiring last year, the top U.S. commander in Europe, Ben Hodges, called for a military zone of free movement similar to the EU's passport-free travel ""Schengen"" zone.

The two-week forum of about 800 politicians, business leaders and traditional chiefs, boycotted by the opposition, issued its report late on Tuesday, recommending eliminating the post of prime minister and creating a fully presidential system.
It proposed re-instating presidential term limits that were scrapped by a 2005 referendum, but the reforms would still let President Idriss Deby, who came to power in a rebellion in 1990, stay on well into old age. 
It recommended six-year rather than five-year presidential terms, limited to a maximum of two terms, effective from the next presidential election in 2021. That would mean Deby could stay in power until 2033, when he will be 81.
Deby pledged before the 2016 election to reinstate term limits, bucking a regional trend that has seen the presidents of Rwanda and Congo Republic remove term limits to stay in office. 
The conference's proposals are expected to be taken up by parliament this year.

Europe's biggest economy and its public pension system are struggling with a rapid aging of the population. In an effort to boost the birth rate, the government has expanded maternity and paternity benefits as well as childcare in the last decade.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision in 2015 to welcome more than a million refugees, mainly from war zones in Syria and Iraq, has also been described as a demographic game changer.
The Federal Statistics Office said 792,131 babies were born in Germany in 2016, up 7 percent on the year before, and the highest number since 1996.
Women between 30 and 37, who had fewer children when they were younger, are now catching up due to favorable economic conditions and family incentives, it said.
Germany is enjoying an unusually prolonged growth cycle, now in its ninth year, as record employment and ultra-low borrowing costs propel a consumer-led upswing.
But while births to German citizens were up 3 percent to around 607,500 babies, the rise was far outstripped by births to citizens of other countries, up a huge 25 percent at 184,660.
""The number of women from countries with a traditionally high birth rate has risen,"" the office said.
A breakdown of the data showed the number of Syrian babies nearly quadrupled to 18,500, those with Iraqi mothers doubled to 5,500 and those with Afghan mothers tripled to 5,900.
The overall fertility rate - the average number of children a woman has in her lifetime - rose to 1.59 from 1.50 in the previous year, the highest level since 1973.
But although the rate among German women edged up slightly to 1.46 children, that among foreign women was more than 50 percent higher at 2.28.
Despite the rise in births and immigration, experts still estimate that Germany's working-age population, whose pension contributions support the growing number of retirees, is likely to shrink in the next decade.

The average fertility rate in the European Union is 1.60, according to the EU statistics office, Eurostat. France has the highest, with 1.92, and Spain and Italy the lowest, with 1.34.

JERUSALEM/GAZA (Reuters) - The Israeli military has deployed more than 100 sharpshooters on the Gaza border ahead of a planned mass Palestinian demonstration, Israel's top general said in an interview published on Wednesday.
Organizers said they expect thousands in Gaza, including entire families, to answer their call to gather in tent cities in five locations along the sensitive border from Friday in a six-week protest for a right of return of Palestinian refugees to what is now Israel.
Citing security concerns, the Israeli military enforces a ""no go"" zone for Palestinians on land in Gaza adjacent to Israel's border fence.
Lieutenant-General Gadi Eizenkot, the military's chief of staff, told the Yedioth Ahronoth daily that the military would not allow ""mass infiltration"" or tolerate damage to the barrier during the protests.
""We have deployed more than 100 sharpshooters who were called up from all of the military's units, primarily from the special forces,"" Eizenkot said in the interview. ""If lives are in jeopardy, there is permission to open fire."" 
Israeli soldiers are confronted by frequent violent Palestinian protests along the Gaza border and have used tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition against demonstrators who the military said hurled rocks or petrol bombs at them.
Organizers said the protest is supported by several Palestinian factions, including Gaza’s dominant Islamist Hamas movement, which is dedicated to the destruction of Israel.
Nickolay Mladenov, the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, called on all sides ""to exercise restraint and take the necessary steps to avoid a violent escalation"".
In a statement emailed to Reuters, he said: ""Children in particular should not be put at risk at any time by anyone.""
RISING TENSION
Israeli cabinet minister Tzachi Hanegbi, speaking on Israel Radio, said Hamas had avoided direct conflict with Israel since the end of the 2014 Gaza war.
But he said that pressure Hamas was now feeling from Israel's destruction of some of its network of attack tunnels near the border, coupled with harsh economic conditions in Gaza, were ""a formula for rising tension"". 
The start of the demonstration was symbolically linked to what Palestinians call ""Land Day"", which commemorates the six Arab citizens of Israel killed by Israeli security forces in demonstrations in 1976 over land confiscations. The week-long Jewish holiday of Passover, when Israel heightens security, also begins on Friday.
The protest is due to end on May 15, the day Palestinians call the “Nakba” or “Catastrophe”, marking the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the conflict surrounding the creation of Israel in 1948.
Palestinians have long demanded that as many as 5 million of their compatriots be granted the right to return. Israel rules this out, fearing an influx of Arabs that would eliminate its Jewish majority. Israel argues the refugees should resettle in a future state that the Palestinians seek in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland revived plans on Wednesday to contribute an extra 1.3 billion Swiss francs ($1.37 billion) in funds for newer European Union members as relations with its biggest trading partner began improving after a spat at the end of last year.
Non-EU Switzerland contributes to a wide range of projects in the 13 mostly ex-communist countries that have joined the bloc since 2004 to boost their prosperity and stability and also guarantee its own continued access to the EU's single market.
Bern had suggested it might not follow through with a second 10-year aid package for the new member states after a row erupted in December over Swiss stock exchanges' access to the EU single market.
But a cabinet meeting on Wednesday decided to move ahead with domestic political consultations on the plan, which will need parliamentary approval. 
In a statement, the government tied the payment to ""the status and progress of overall relations between Switzerland and the EU, in particular developments with respect to the EU's recognition of the regulatory equivalence of the Swiss stock exchange"".
Switzerland had accused the EU of trying to undermine its financial center by granting its stock exchanges only temporary access to the bloc. Bern wants the same treatment as other countries, enabling EU investors to trade in Switzerland.
Diplomats say the mood has brightened considerably since Bern laid out this month its negotiating position on a new treaty Brussels wants that would formalize ties currently governed by a patchwork of bilateral sectoral accords.
It marked the first time that the seven cabinet members from four parties had agreed on a unified platform for talks, a major step forward after their squabbling hampered years of negotiations and frustrated top EU officials.
Brussels has put pressure on Switzerland to sign a treaty that would see it adopt EU laws governing the single market as the price of enhanced access. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) would give its opinion on disputes involving how to interpret single-market rules.
This is anathema to the anti-immigration Swiss People's Party, the largest in parliament, which has two cabinet seats.

Many Swiss conservatives are also wary of giving ""foreign judges"" such power, but both sides have now focused on setting up arbitration panels to help break the impasse.

YANGON (Reuters) - Lawyers for two Reuters reporters jailed in Myanmar asked a court on Wednesday to throw out the case, saying there was insufficient evidence to support charges against the pair, who are accused of possessing secret government papers.
A court in Yangon has been holding preliminary hearings since January to decide whether Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, will be charged under the colonial-era Officials Secrets Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.
On Wednesday, defense lawyer Khin Maung Zaw filed a motion to dismiss the case. The district court in northern Yangon agreed to hear arguments from prosecutors and defense lawyers on the motion on April 4.
""Of all the prosecution witnesses that have testified and been cross-examined, no proof"" of legally sufficient evidence could be made against the defendants, Khin Maung Zaw told reporters after the hearing.
""It's suitable for the defense lawyers to ask for the release at this stage,"" he said, adding that there had been discrepancies in the testimony of some witnesses. He declined to elaborate.
Lead prosecutor Kyaw Min Aung left the court building before Reuters was able to put questions to him after the hearing. At previous hearings he has declined to speak to reporters.
Government and police spokespeople have declined to comment on the case, citing the ongoing court proceedings. 
APPEAL TO NEW PRESIDENT
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have been in custody since their arrest on Dec. 12.
The journalists had been working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men in a village in western Myanmar's Rakhine state during a military crackdown in August, which has sent nearly 700,000 people fleeing to Bangladesh. 
They have told relatives they were arrested almost immediately after being handed some rolled up papers at a restaurant in northern Yangon by two policemen they had not met before, having been invited to meet the officers for dinner. 
Previous police witnesses, however, have said the reporters were stopped and searched at a traffic checkpoint by officers who were unaware they were journalists, and found to be holding in their hands documents relating to security force deployments in Rakhine.
During a break in proceedings, Wa Lone made an appeal to Myanmar's new President Win Myint, a close ally of the leader of the civilian government Aung San Suu Kyi, who was elected by parliament on Wednesday.
""Journalists who are in the Insein prison at the moment would like to say to the newly elected president that we are now in Insein prison because we covered news, we are facing court because we found out the unjust things,"" he told reporters. ""I would like to ask the new president to bring about media freedom for the press.""
Calls to the spokesman for Myanmar's civilian government seeking comment went unanswered. 
Myanmar's ambassador to the United Nations, Hau Do Suan, said last month that the journalists were not arrested for reporting a story, but were accused of ""illegally possessing confidential government documents"".
Senior U.N. officials, Western nations and press freedom advocates have called for the release of the journalists. 

Diplomats from Australia, the European Union, Denmark and the Netherlands were among those who attended Wednesday's hearing.

Rudd was asked about 700 Russians who had come to Britain between 2008 and 2015 with a ""Tier 1 visa"", given to people who want to run businesses in Britain who have at least 50,000 pounds ($70,750) in investment funds. 
""The Tier 1 was already reformed in 2015-2016 and it has been reduced by 84 percent since then,"" Rudd told a committee of lawmakers. ""I have asked my officials to look at what reforms we may continue with and to take a look at previous ones over the past few years."" 
""I have asked to look at the cohort of previous ones to see if there is any action that needs to be taken,"" she added.

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Theresa May said it was right for Britain to examine whether that part of the visa regime was being used properly.

326,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 07:01AM ET</span>",North Korea's Kim seen building global status in trip to China,"By Christine Kim and Ben Blanchard
SEOUL/BEIJING (Reuters) - Accompanied by his wife, greeted by honor guards, and entertained at banquets, Kim Jong Un made his international debut as North Korea's leader by being wined and dined in the capital of the world's most populous country.
Kim's ""unofficial"" visit to China this week marks his first known trip outside the North since taking power in late 2011, and it helped burnish the image he has recently been cultivating as a leader who has to be shown respect by the world's most powerful. 
Despite recent chilly relations between the neighbors, Chinese President Xi Jinping rolled out an actual red carpet for Kim, who arrived from Pyongyang in a 21-car bulletproof train.
""Just look at Kim's big smile on his face while he's shaking hands with Xi,"" said Kim Yong-hyun, professor of North Korean studies at South Korea's Dongguk University. ""Although it was Kim's first trip outside North Korea since he took power, he looked quite confident, posing himself as a world player equal to China's Xi.""
The surprise visit to Beijing comes as Kim has launched a diplomatic offensive, proposing upcoming summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and U.S. President Donald Trump.
LAVISH RECEPTION
In line with the previous three visits by Kim's father to China, the Chinese government described the trip as unofficial, with no North Korean flags hung around Beijing's Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) as happens with state visits.
But Chinese state television gave similar coverage to Kim's meetings with Xi as they did to Xi's meetings with Trump last year, with an unusually long 14-minute report of what Xi and Kim discussed and where and how they met, though the initial secrecy of the trip meant no live coverage of the welcome ceremony.
The images showed the two men chatting in a friendly way, and Xi's wife Peng Liyuan also greeting Kim's wife, Ri Sol Ju. Kim and Ri were shown waving out of a window as their car drew away.
In making the trip to Beijing in the customized train, Kim sought to highlight his place as the heir to his father Kim Jong Il, said Aidan Foster-Carter, an honorary senior research fellow at Britain's Leeds University. His father had also gone to China by train on his visits.
""Ordinary mortals just take the plane,"" he said. ""The train sets the precedent of following in daddy's footsteps.""
But by making his wife a key figure in the Beijing trip, Kim parted from his father's behavior and mirrored the ways of today's modern country leaders.
Kim Jong Il had never been seen abroad with any of his wives, though he was believed to have been accompanied by the woman suspected of being his fourth wife on visits to China and Russia, yet it was never announced officially.
""Unlike his father, Kim Jong Un presented Ri Sol Ju as first lady of North Korea, emphasizing her status and portraying his image as a normal leader,"" said Dongkuk University's Kim. ""It appears to be a well-calculated tactic that would help turn Kim's hostile and unfavorable image to a gentle and sane one.""
LEGITIMACY AT HOME AND ABROAD
As the leader of a country often called reclusive and strange, Kim is also much younger than many world leaders, a difference that gets additional resonance in Asia, where respectful deference to elders is widely upheld.
Estimated to be 34, Kim is decades younger than 64-year-old Xi, 65-year-old Moon, and Trump, who is 71.
Frosty relations between Beijing and Pyongyang since Kim took office had seen state-to-state relations deteriorate, but the two sides have always maintained party-to-party ceremonies and traditions, such as sending envoys to share the outcomes of key party meetings, according to diplomats.
Kim officially cast his visit in the same light, saying he felt obligated to come congratulate Xi in person on his recent re-appointment as president, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry's account of the trip.
China's most senior party diplomat, Politburo member Yang Jiechi, attended the main meeting between Xi and Kim, along with Wang Huning, the party's top theoretician. The government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, was also there, though at the far end of the table.
From the North, Kim Jong Un brought with him the country's most high-profile officials, including vice chairman of the Workers' Party Central Committee Choe Ryong Hae, Politburo member Ri Su Yong, Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, and Kim Yong Chol, a former intelligence chief who now handles inter-Korean affairs.
Taking nearly all of his closest aides highlights the confidence he may be feeling now that he has secured his position, showing that he doesn't fear there could be a coup against him during his time away, said Yang Moo-jin, professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.

""We saw many high-ranking officials with Kim, but almost none from the military. One could worry about a military coup, but the fact that he made this trip as he did shows he's completely in charge of the military as well as all of North Korea's internal networks,"" Yang said.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian voters said they had received payments, food and other incentives to go to the polls as authorities sought on Wednesday to achieve the high turnout President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi wants to legitimize his all but guaranteed victory.
As voting went into the third and final day, turnout was seen as the critical factor in an election where any contest was eliminated through the arrest or intimidation of the former military commander's most serious challengers.
Sisi said he wanted more opponents to stand, but instead faced just one who has been dismissed as a dummy candidate.
The election commission has said the vote is free and fair.
Sisi, who led the military overthrow of freely-elected Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in 2013, has promised security and stability and to revive the economy after unrest that followed a 2011 popular uprising.
Sisi's key allies include the United States and the powerful Gulf monarchies of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
In the first two days of voting, turnout was estimated at well below the 47 percent of the electorate who backed Sisi for the first time in 2014. By Wednesday, authorities appeared desperate to garner a higher percentage.
INCENTIVES
Voters interviewed by Reuters in the first two days of polling said they had been offered money, boxes of basic food and services to cast their ballots, or to at least ink their fingers to make it look as if they had.
""I've never voted before, and I didn't intend to this time either,"" a woman in Cairo's working-class Ward estate said.
""I just went and dipped my finger in the paint and took the 50 pounds ($3),"" she said. The woman declined to give her name for fear of reprisals by authorities.
Other women, who also declined to be named, said they had been promised bags of food containing rice and vegetable oil in exchange for votes.
""They told me that if I voted and showed them (the ink on) my finger I will get a bag,"" said one, who also declined to be named.
The women did not say who exactly had given them money or bags of goods.
Managers at a government financial institution gave employees half of Monday off and ordered them to vote, one employee told Reuters. Employees were told to ""not come back without ink on their fingers"" and had their hands inspected the next day, the employee said.
Asked for comment, the presidency spokesman said this was not a matter for the presidency to address and referred Reuters to the National Election Commission and spokespeople for the presidential campaigns. Officials at the election commission and the government's foreign press center did not immediately respond to calls and Whatsapp messages requesting comment.
Some people needed no inducement to vote. Noha al-Nemr, voting in Cairo's middle-class Mohandiseen district, said: ""I voted for Sisi of course, because it's enough that because of him, my family and I live in safety - even if there's hardship."" 
Incentives for voting were made more public in other areas.
In Beheira province, governor Nadia Abdou told Mehwar private TV channel on Monday: ""Whichever municipality has the most votes, we will fix their water, sewage and electricity ... We will reward those people who came out in large numbers.""
Pro-government media, meanwhile, portrayed failure to vote as a betrayal of Egypt, the most populous Arab country.
""BETRAYING THE MARTYRS""
Hosts of state-run radio programs told listeners that if they did not vote, they would be ""betraying the blood of the martyrs in Sinai"", a reference to a military campaign against Islamist militants in the northern Sinai Peninsula.
An elderly woman in the Mohandiseen neighborhood of Cairo said she decided to vote after listening to the radio shows.
The vote virtually guarantees Sisi a win. His only opponent is an obscure politician loyal to the incumbent. More serious challengers were forced to step down and several opposition politicians called earlier this year for an election boycott.
Sisi has said he had nothing to do with opposition candidates pulling out, and has repeatedly urged the electorate to vote in great numbers.

Two sources monitoring the election, including one from the National Election Commission, said about 13.5 percent of 59 million eligible voters had cast ballots on Monday.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore on Wednesday invited Human Rights Watch to give evidence at a parliamentary hearing on ""fake news"" as a dispute grew between the New York-based group and the city state.
A parliamentary committee in Singapore is reviewing possible measures to prevent ""deliberate online falsehoods"", mirroring efforts in various countries to tackle false information amid growing questions about the influence of internet companies.
Activists worry that laws aimed at ""fake news"" could be used to stifle free speech.
""We can hear you on any date in May, or after May, after Parliament reopens,"" the committee said in a press release, addressing Human Rights Watch (HRW).
Vikram Nair, a member of the ruling People's Action Party, said this week Human Rights Watch had in a recent report used ""clearly false"" examples to further its agenda and undermine public discourse.
In its report, the rights group called on Singapore to amend or repeal laws that it said were too broadly worded and were used to ""arrest, harass, and prosecute critical voices"", including a Sedition Act and Public Order Act.
The group cited several examples including a defamation case against a blogger, a case against an activist opposed to the death penalty and a case against a free-speech campaigner.
""From the examples it relies on, HRW seems to advocate the use of false and fabricated allegations in political discourse,"" Nair said in a written argument submitted to the committee.
Nair was among 79 people asked to speak in parliament over the eight days set for the hearing.
The committee said it had earlier invited a HRW official to speak at a hearing in late March, which the group first accepted but later declined.
Human Rights Watch Asia director Brad Adams said it had sought the Singapore government's view ahead of the publication of its report but had received none. 
The group's earlier offer to send an official to testify before the Singapore committee also went unanswered, he said.
""The purpose of the hearing was not to discuss our findings and recommendations in good faith, or to get our input into dealing with 'deliberate online falsehoods' ... but to engage in ridiculous and irrelevant arguments aimed to discredit our report and Human Rights Watch,"" he said in a statement.
Last week, representatives of global tech giants including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter spoke at the hearing to express concern about new laws to tackle falsehoods, saying sufficient rules were already in place.
Singapore ranks 151 out of 180 countries in a World Press Freedom Index issued by Reporters Without Borders, a non-government group that promotes freedom of information.
Neighboring Malaysia is debating legislation aimed at jailing ""fake news"" offenders for up to 10 years.

Li, a community college lecturer and an activist at a human rights non-governmental organization in Taiwan, disappeared while visiting China in March last year.
He was found guilty of subversion in November in a trial that his wife denounced as illegitimate and has since been held in central China's Hunan province.
Li Ching-yu, his wife, visited her husband on Tuesday for the first time since he was jailed.
""Judging by his outward appearance, Li Ming-che's current situation in prison seems all right, but his right to speak, as well as his basic communication rights are still being restricted,"" Li told reporters after returning to Taiwan from China.
Her husband currently cannot write her letters, apparently, she was told, because he was too busy working, and he only received two of the 11 books she sent to him, Li said.
The couple spoke for 30 minutes by telephone, separated by glass, she said.
No one answered the telephone when Reuters called the publicly listed number for the jail where Li is being held.
The case has added tension in fraying ties between Taipei and Beijing. After the November ruling, Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party said it was strongly dissatisfied and called for Beijing to allow Li to return to Taiwan.
Li admitted during his trial to having criticized China's ruling Communist Party and to having shared articles and arguments promoting Taiwan's multi-party democracy.
China views self-ruled Taiwan as a wayward province and said last week Taiwan would face the ""punishment of history"" for any attempt at independence.

Ponsati, a professor at the University of St Andrews, is fighting extradition and will seek bail and a full hearing, her lawyer has said. She is one of several former Catalan senior officials being sought by the Spanish judiciary for their part in an independence referendum deemed illegal under Spanish law.
Ponsati arrived at a central Edinburgh police station accompanied by her lawyer. A Scottish court will decide later on Wednesday whether to grant her bail pending a full hearing.
The lawyer, Aamer Anwar, said: ""Clara remains defiant, resolute and is determined to fight back."" 
Ponsati believes she will not get a fair trial in Spain, where the secessionists are locked in a battle with the state and most of them are either behind bars ahead of trial or in exile. 
""Like other Catalan politicians, I promoted the peaceful democratic referendum in October 2017, yet now face charges including rebellion with violence against the unity of the Spanish nation,"" Ponsati said in statement, part of a crowdfunding effort to support her.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Wednesday told members of the Mafia in Italy, where many go to Church and worship openly, that they cannot call themselves Christians because they ""carry death in their souls"".
Francis' improvised words before tens of thousands of people at his weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) was his strongest attack on organized crime in nearly four years.
""So we don't have to go far, let's think about what happens right here at home (Italy),"" he said while speaking generally about ""fake Christians"" who are corrupt while pretending to be righteous.
""(What about) the so-called Christian Mafiosi,"" he said. ""They have nothing at all in them that is Christian. They call themselves Christians but they carry death in their souls and inflict it on others.""
Many members of organized crime groups in Italy, such as Sicily's Cosa Nostra and Calabria's 'Ndrangheta, see themselves as part of a religious, cult-like group.
Particularly in smaller towns and cities in the south, they take part in Catholic sacraments, go to church and in some cases have also found complicity by some churchmen.
The town of Oppido Mamertina in the Calabria region made headlines in 2014 when locals carrying a statute of the Madonna in a traditional religious procession diverted its route to pass by the home of local mob boss who was infirm.
They paused before the boss' house and tilted the statue slightly as if to kneel in a sign of respect toward the clan boss.
When Pope Francis visited the Calabria region the same year, he accused organized crime members of practising ""the adoration of evil"" and said Mafiosi excommunicate themselves from the Church by their actions.
At the audience in St. Peter's Square on Wednesday, Francis asked the faithful for prayers for Mafiosi, ""so that the Lord touches their souls"".
In 1993 Pope John Paul sternly warned members of Sicily's Cosa Nostra that they would ""one day face the justice of God"". The crime group responded several months later with bomb attacks against several churches in Rome, including the Basilica of St. John's, which is a pope's church in his capacity as bishop of Rome.

In recent years, the Calabria-based 'Ndrangheta has overtaken Sicily's Cosa Nostra as the most feared and lucrative Italian crime group, making most of its money from drug trafficking. It has spread throughout the world.

The work by US artist Michael Rakowitz is the latest of 11 to be commissioned to occupy the square's fourth plinth, which was erected in 1841 to display an equestrian statue but left bare for 158 years after funding ran out.
The bull replaces a giant ""thumbs up"" by David Shrigley and will stay in place until 2020 when it will be replaced by a work by British artist Heather Phillipson.
Rakowitz’s project, made of 10,000 empty Iraqi date syrup cans, mimics the original winged bull known as the Lamassu which stood from about 700 BC on the outskirts of modern-day Mosul, Iraq, until it was destroyed by IS.

In a report citing security officials on Tuesday, Anadolu said Patrick Kraicker, 28, was detained on March 14 in the Silopi district of the southeastern province of Sirnak.
During his questioning, Kraicker said he wanted to cross into Syria to join the Syrian Kurdish PYD, according to Anadolu. 
Ankara considers the PYD, and its YPG armed group, to be extensions of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) which has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast.
Anadolu said Kraicker was later arrested for ""aiding and abetting a terrorist organization"".
Turkey last month released German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yucel, removing a key irritant in ties between the two allies, but German officials remain deeply concerned about Turkey's deteriorating record on human rights and freedoms and its military operations in northern Syria.
Turkish forces and their rebel allies launched an offensive against the YPG in northern Syria's Afrin region in January and took over the town of Afrin 10 days ago.

334,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 07:04AM ET</span>",Saudis likely to show restraint as Yemen crisis escalates,"By Stephen Kalin and Sarah Dadouch
RIYADH (Reuters) - A missile attack this week on Riyadh has raised the risk of an escalation in the Yemen war in a region riven with interwoven conflicts, but a direct confrontation between arch-foes Saudi Arabia and Iran still appears unlikely.
Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, now touring the United States, must balance animosity towards Iran with the need for stability as he pitches the kingdom's economic transformation plan to foreign investors and drums up support for containing Iran's regional influence.
However, Iranian authorities - facing the prospect of a more hawkish U.S. administration with Donald Trump's appointments last week of John Bolton and Mike Pompeo as national security adviser and secretary of state - might crank up pressure in the Yemen war as a form of deterrence, diplomats and analysts say.
Saudi Arabia sharpened its rhetoric against Tehran after Saudi forces shot down a flurry of missiles launched by the Iran-aligned Houthis on Saudi cities late on Sunday. One of the missiles caused the war's first casualties in the Saudi capital Riyadh when falling debris struck a home and killed an Egyptian man and injured two others.
Saudi King Salman, in comments carried by state media, pledged on Tuesday to ""firmly and decisively thwart any hostile attempts"" targeting the kingdom's security and stability. 
A day earlier, the spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthi movement accused it of using Iranian-made missiles and said that Saudi Arabia reserved the right to respond to Iran when and how it deemed appropriate.
The coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 in a campaign to restore its internationally recognised government after it was driven into exile by Houthi forces.
""Iran is the appendicitis in the body of the world and should fix itself or else the world will fix the Iranian situation,"" spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said.
Iran has repeatedly denied giving missiles to the Houthis.
FEW MILITARY OPTIONS
Analysts said that in the short term, the Saudi leadership is unlikely to respond aggressively amid increased international scrutiny of the three-year-old Yemen conflict, which has given rise to the world's most urgent humanitarian crisis.
""Prince Mohammed would like to be viewed as a more restrained and composed leader"" while touring his closest Western ally, the United States, according to Ehsan Khomen, MENA strategist at MUFG consultancy.
""(He) may leverage the recent Houthi missile attacks to strengthen his narrative that Iran's encroachment is undermining regional stability and that a more concerted international effort is needed to contain Iran.""
The Yemen conflict pits a coalition of Western-friendly states led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against the Houthis, who are sympathetic to Iran but deny being a pawn of its Shi'ite Muslim theocracy.
Yemen's war fits into a broader decades-long struggle for supremacy between Middle East powerhouses Iran and Saudi Arabia, which fund and train proxy forces in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon and accuse each other of backing terrorism.
Military escalation in response to the latest rocket salvo could mean more coalition air strikes - which have been widely criticised for killing civilians - or mobilising the Saudi National Guard from a mostly static position along the border to undertake a concerted ground assault inside northern Yemen.
Diplomats and analysts say that the coalition has few other options short of direct action against an Iranian target, something that remains unlikely unless a Houthi rocket takes out a valuable Saudi asset.
Last year, when the Houthis fired missiles at Riyadh that were intercepted, the coalition responded by shutting Yemen's airports and ports. The United Nations said that blockade raised the danger of mass starvation, and it was partially lifted.
""They may make similar moves in order to be seen to be doing something, but it won't really change the dynamics of the conflict,"" said Jane Kinninmont, Middle East expert at Chatham House in London. 
""My concern is that they could be tempted to take some action directly against some Iranian target, and that any such course of action could escalate further.""
Consultancy Eurasia Group said that a successful Houthi strike on a prized Saudi target would probably prompt a firm military response from Riyadh to try to deter Iran.
Analysts said that while a direct Saudi-Iranian showdown is unlikely, miscalculation remains a risk.
MEDIATION EFFORTS
Western countries have urged Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies to protect civilians and find a quick end to Yemen's war. But they also support Riyadh's argument that it needs to defend itself from cross-border strikes and limit the spread of Iran's imprint in territory overlooking important trade routes.
The United Nations says more than 10,000 people have died in the war, and 22.2 million Yemenis - three-quarters of the population - need relief aid. More than 1 million cholera cases have been reported, the worst outbreak in modern history.
Analysts said that while Saudi Arabia will probably double down on its military campaign in Yemen to oust the Houthis from the capital Sanaa and reinstate President Abd Rabbu Mansour al-Hadi, it may continue to support mediation efforts.
However, the appointments of Bolton and Pompeo in Washington could encourage Iran to ramp up activities in Yemen to signal its ability and willingness to undermine the United States and its partners, Eurasia Group said.
Economists have played down the impact of the Houthi attacks on the Saudi economy, which Prince Mohammed is trying to wean off oil exports with a slate of reforms that include cutting energy subsidies and expanding the private sector.

Investors may have already largely priced in risks from Houthi missile strikes. But an intensification of the Yemen conflict and certainly an escalation to direct conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia could scare off foreign investors.

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese authorities have detained an ""underground"" bishop who is being asked to take a subordinate role in the church as part of a landmark deal between the Vatican and the Communist government, two sources said on Wednesday.
The sources with knowledge of the matter said Guo Xijin, known as an ""underground"" bishop as he has not joined the Chinese state-controlled Catholic Patriotic Association that operates independently of the Vatican, had been picked up by security officials in Fujian province.
The Catholic news outlet Asia News reported on Tuesday Guo had been detained after he declined to officiate Easter masses with Zhan Silu, one of seven Chinese government-appointed bishops not recognized by the Vatican.
Catholics in China are split between ""underground"" communities that recognize the pope and those belonging to the Catholic Patriotic Association where bishops are appointed by the government in collaboration with Church communities.
One of the sources familiar with the matter said Guo and two priests in Fujian were detained. A second source, with extensive contacts in the underground church, said Guo had been taken away for a day but had since returned to his diocese.
Both of the sources declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. Neither said why Guo had been detained.
The Ningde City public security bureau in Fujian and the Fujian Provincial Bureau of Nationalities and Religious Affairs did not answer repeated telephone calls.
China's Ministry of Public Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he had no understanding of the situation, but the government fully protected people's right to freedom of religion.
Guo's detention comes as unprecedented efforts are underway between Beijing and the Vatican to resolve the thorny issue of who gets to appoint bishops.
'AUXILIARY'
A senior Vatican source told Reuters last month a framework accord was ready and could be signed in months. It could open the way for a resumption of diplomatic relations nearly 70 years after they were cut during the Communist takeover of China.
Full relations would give the Church a legal framework to look after all of China's estimated 12 million Catholics and move on to focus on Catholic growth in a country where Protestant churches are already growing fast.
Under the expected deal, the Vatican would have a say in negotiations for the appointment of future bishops, Reuters reported in February.
In order to facilitate it, the Vatican-recognized bishop Guo was being asked to become an auxiliary to the government-appointed Zhan, the Vatican source said.
Critics of the deal, including Cardinal Joseph Zen, the outspoken former bishop of Hong Kong, have suggested the Vatican is about to ""sell out"" those Catholics in China, like Guo, who have remained loyal to the Vatican and suffered hardship for doing so.
Asia News said in its report Guo had been detained for 20 days last year over Easter.
A deal between the Vatican and Beijing would likely leave Taiwan in the diplomatic lurch.

The diplomats were expelled over the poisoning in Britain of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. Britain alleges Russia was to blame, but Moscow says it had no involvement.

The National Front's Marine Le Pen and France Unbowed's Jean-Luc Melenchon had defied a prominent Jewish group's wishes by taking part in the march to honor Mireille Knoll.
The 85-year-old was found dead with 11 stab wounds at her apartment in a working-class district of Paris on Friday. The apartment was set ablaze after the attack and her body badly burnt. Police suspect that Knoll's Jewish religion was a motive for the killing.
Le Pen and Melenchon joined the march but they met a hostile reception from participants and when tensions threatened to boil over they pulled out. Le Pen later managed to rejoin the demonstration. 
Knoll was buried on Wednesday in Bagneux on the southern outskirts of Paris ahead of the march organized by Crif, an umbrella body of French Jewish groups. Crif's leader told far-right and far-left groups not to attend the rally.
""Anti-Semites are over-represented in the far left and the far right, making those parties ones that you don't want to be associated with,"" Crif director Francis Kalifat told RTL radio. ""Therefore they are not welcome.""
His comments underscore the enduring alarm among France's 400,000-strong Jewish community over anti-Semitism, which Interior Minister Gerard Collomb on Tuesday described as a cancer that must not be allowed to eat away at the nation.
""We've got our place here. Once again (the Crif) have got the wrong enemy. We've been fighting Islamist anti-Semitism for years,"" Le Pen said defiantly despite the hostile reception she received.
Other marches were held in Lyon, Marseille and Strasbourg. 
Le Pen has strived to rid the party of the toxic anti-Semitic reputation it gained under her father, party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen.
However, France's highest court provided a reminder of the party's past on Tuesday when it upheld the conviction of her father for describing the Nazi gas chambers as a ""detail"" of history. It confirmed a 30,000 euro ($37,000)fine against him.
Israel's Foreign Ministry condemned Knoll's murder and said it ""underlines the need to continue combating anti-Semitism in all its variations"".
Knoll escaped being deported to Auschwitz during World War Two, when 13,000 Jews were rounded up in July 1942 in the capital's Velodrome d'Hiver.
Her son Daniel said the rally should be open to everyone. 
""Crif is playing politics but I'm just opening my heart,"" he told RMC radio.
President Emmanuel Macron's government said the rally should be a moment for national unity. 

Macron made reference to Knoll's death in a national tribute to a gendarme killed last week in an Islamist attack. The president said Knoll was murdered ""because she was Jewish"", by a killer who did not value life.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland signed the largest weapons procurement deal in its history on Wednesday, agreeing with the United States to buy Raytheon Co's Patriot missile defense system for $4.75 billion as it modernizes its forces to face a bolder Russia.
""It is an extraordinary, historic moment; it is Poland's introduction into a whole new world of state-of-the-art technology, modern weaponry, and defensive means,"" Poland's President Andrzej Duda said during the signing ceremony.
NATO member Poland has sped up efforts to overhaul its armory following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014 and Moscow's renewed military and political assertiveness in the region. Two-thirds of Polish weaponry dates from the era when the country was in the Moscow-led Warsaw Pact.
The Patriot deal comes as a relief for Poland which remains in tense relations with Washington, its main NATO ally, over a bill that Warsaw introduced in January to impose jail terms for any suggestion of Poland's complicity in the Holocaust.
The United States says the bill subverts freedom of speech. Israeli officials say it amounts to Holocaust denial, an accusation Poland rejects.
The Wednesday deal is for four Patriot fire units, and Warsaw is negotiating with Washington to buy more Patriot systems, a new 360-degree radar and a low-cost interceptor missile as part of a second phase of development.
""We do expect that Poland will move pretty quickly with Phase II. They have a stated desire to complete that by the end of the year,"" Wes Kremer, president of Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, told Reuters in a telephone interview ahead of the signing. 

The deal will allow Poland to conduct air and missile defense operations with NATO allies the Netherlands, Germany, Spain and Greece, which already have the Patriot systems, U.S. State Department officials have said.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian anti-terrorism police said on Wednesday they had arrested an Italian citizen of Moroccan origin on suspicion of supporting Islamic State and were investigating his accomplices. 
It was the latest in a series of arrests this month involving suspected supporters of Islamist terrorism and came as Italy steps up the number of foreigners it expels. 
A statement identified the arrested man as Elmahdi Halili, 23, who was arrested in the northern city of Turin.
Police said Halili had received a two-year suspended prison term in 2015 for ""instigating terrorism"" by running a website that praised Islamic State and hailed some of the attacks it or its supporters carried out in Europe.
The police operation targeted an undisclosed number of other people, both foreign and Italian, some of whom had converted to Islam and were part of ""a campaign of radicalization"". It was not clear from the statement if they also had been arrested.
Details of the operation, in which about 13 homes were searched, were due to be announced at a news conference later on Wednesday.
In an interview published on Wednesday in the Turin newspaper La Stampa, Interior Minister Marco Minniti said the security threat to Italy from supporters of Islamic State was higher than ever.
Minniti said this was because more so-called foreign fighters would be attempting to return to Europe via Italy after IS suffered a series of defeats in Syria and Iraq.
Wednesday's operation was the latest in a string of arrests in Italy of people suspected of supporting Islamic State.
On Tuesday in the southern city of Foggia, police arrested an Egyptian-born man suspected of being a member of Islamic State and of indoctrinating young children in a cultural center he ran. They said the man encouraged the children to kill non-Muslims.
On March 15, police acting on a tip from the U.S. FBI arrested a man of Latvian origin who they said had been preparing pipe bombs. A judge's detention order said the man had been considering an attack on a kindergarten.
In recent months, Italy has stepped up expulsions of foreigners believed to be a threat to national security. So far this year, 29 have been expelled, most of them Muslims, compared to 132 for all of 2017.

LUSAKA (Reuters) - Zambia's parliament has delayed a debate due on Wednesday on a motion seeking to impeach President Edgar Lungu over accusations of breaching the constitution, according to a letter from the parliamentary clerk seen by Reuters. 
Zambia's main opposition party, the United Party for National Development (UPND), filed a motion last week. The notice set Wednesday as the date for the lawmakers' debate and vote on the motion. [nL8N1R511G]
""In view of the gravity of the motion, the same is being studied and we shall revert to you in due course,"" said the letter sent on Monday from the Clerk of the National Assembly to Garry Nkombo, UPND parliamentary Chief Whip who filed the motion.
UPND spokesman Charles Kakoma said the motion would now not be debated until parliament's next session begins in June. Signed by a third of the 166-member house, the motion needs the backing of two thirds to succeed. 
The opposition argues Lungu violated the constitution in 2016 when it challenged his election victory in court, alleging electoral fraud, a claim the government denied. 
The opposition believes that under the constitution, the president should, when faced with a legal challenge of this kind, hand over power to the speaker of the National Assembly until the court makes a decision.
The UPND's case against Lungu was dismissed on a technicality after its lawyers failed to provide evidence within the required time limit.
Chishimba Kambwili, a lawmaker of Lungu's ruling Patriotic Front who seconded Nkombo's motion, was arrested last Thursday by Zambia's Anti-Corruption Commission on suspicion of fraud. [nL8N1R44NW]
Kambwili, a former cabinet minister who has repeatedly accused government officials of corruption, fell ill while in police custody and was taken to a private hospital for treatment, police and his lawyers said.

He was subsequently transferred to a government hospital for continued treatment on Tuesday, they said.

NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - Myanmar's parliament on Wednesday picked a close ally of de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi as the country's new president, a move unlikely to affect a delicate balance of power in a country where the army has retained a large political role.
Win Myint, who a week ago resigned from his post as the lower house speaker, was chosen by both chambers of the parliament where Suu Kyi's ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) party holds a comfortable majority.
The outgoing president, Htin Kyaw, who was also close to Suu Kyi, retired ""in order to take rest from the current duties and responsibilities"" amid visible weight loss and speculation over his health.
The election of the 66-year-old Win Myint, who is a life-long NLD member, is likely to mean a continuation of Suu Kyi's dominance over the executive and little change to the course taken by her nearly two-year-old administration, lawmakers and analysts say.
Win Myint won the election with 403 votes out of 636 cast by lawmakers. The parliament speaker did not say when Win Myint would be sworn in, although the ceremony was expected to take place on Thursday.
""There won't be policy changes. The policy will continue as previously under the former president,"" said Kyaw Tote, a lawmaker from the NLD.
The president is the head of state and government in Myanmar, and under the constitution has far-reaching powers. However, Htin Kyaw's role was more ceremonial because Suu Kyi has been Myanmar's de facto leader since April 2016.
Politicians and analysts expect this arrangement to continue under Win Myint.
A constitution drafted by the former junta bars Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi from the top office and so she hand-picked Htin Kyaw, a close ally, to become president following a historic landslide election victory in 2015.
The charter also reserves for the army one quarter of the seats in parliament and several major cabinet posts, including defense, interior and border affairs, giving it an effective veto over constitutional change and control of security affairs.
The incoming president is a member of a very narrow circle of Suu Kyi's trusted advisers. Analysts believe it is that loyalty and trust that prompted her to tap him as Htin Kyaw's replacement. 
He was among a few dozen NLD members, including Suu Kyi, elected to parliament in 2012 by-elections as the country began a dramatic transition from nearly 50 years of military rule.
""He is good at both legislation and administration and I assume that is a good thing,"" said NLD upper house representative Nwe Nwe Aung.

Before his appointment as lower house speaker in April 2016, Win Myint shared an austere one-room chamber with his wife in a compound for lawmakers in Myanmar's purpose-built capital Naypyitaw, living next to other leading NLD figures.

Salvador Panelo, chief presidential legal counsel, said Duterte had ordered police to arrest those responsible.
""They do not only undermine or weaken the national economy by hitting a large-scale industry, they also threaten national security by endangering the health of a vast majority of the people,"" Panelo said in a statement.

Panelo said poor-quality drugs could also contribute to antibiotic resistance, threatening to undermine life-saving medicines in future.

More than 4,000 Filipinos have been killed by police during Duterte’s war on illegal drug use and thousands more by unidentified armed men. Police say those killed were all dealers who put up violent resistance.

The Cayman Islands-flagged Equanimity, a 300-foot superyacht allegedly bought by money stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), was impounded on behalf of U.S. authorities off the coast of Bali last month, amid a multi-billion dollar corruption investigation launched by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ). 
The DOJ is seeking to move the yacht to the United States where it can be taken into U.S. government custody and sold, according to a filing at a California court.
The department said Low bought the yacht with funds ""stolen and embezzled from 1MDB"" and said he is fighting the U.S. seizure through four companies, named as claimants in the case.
The claimants kept the yacht ""in a series of foreign locations and frustrated the government's efforts to bring this asset to the United States"", the DOJ filing said.
""There was significant evidence that Low instructed claimants to keep the Equanimity outside the government's hands and outside the United States,"" it said.
It said Low, also known as Jho Low, had instructed crew members to turn off the yacht's Automatic Identification System and avoid sailing into certain jurisdictions such as Singapore and Australia in order to evade detection.
Lawyers for the claimants had also filed a lawsuit in Indonesia intended to stop the seizure, the department said.
A total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates, according to civil lawsuits filed by the department under a kleptocracy asset recovery initiative.
Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up 1MDB in 2009 and previously served as chairman of its advisory board. He and the fund have denied any wrongdoing.
Low's whereabouts are unknown and a spokesman at a U.S.-based public relations firm that has represented him did not respond to requests for comment. 
Low had previously denied wrongdoing, saying it was ""disappointing that, rather than reflecting on the deeply flawed and politically motivated allegations, the DOJ is continuing with its pattern of global overreach"".
In a separate filing on Monday, the claimants' lawyers also applied for an emergency order to keep the Equanimity in Indonesia for 30 days, saying that moving it to the United States would endanger the lives of the crew and lower the value of the yacht.
The claimants also said the government intended to sell the vessel in a way that would ""wholly fail to maximize its value"".
The DOJ filed a response on Tuesday saying keeping the yacht in Indonesia could risk interfering with sovereign rights.

Other Low assets sought by the department include a private jet, a hotel and real estate in New York, and a $107 million interest in EMI Music Publishing.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A group of Australia-based academics who study China said well-documented reports show actions by China's Communist Party amounted to ""unacceptable interference"" in Australia's society and politics, entering a debate dividing their community.
The Australian government wants to impose laws that criminalize foreign political interference after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said late last year that foreign powers were making ""unprecedented and increasingly sophisticated attempts to influence the political process.""
He cited ""disturbing reports about Chinese influence"". China denies the suggestions.
In a submission on Wednesday to a parliamentary review of the proposed law, the academics suggested the Communist Party's action has the ""potential to harm Australia's interests and sovereignty."" The submission did not provide specific examples of the reports it referred to in its submission.
Critics have accused some universities in Australia of curtailing their China research because they receive funding from donors said to have ties to Beijing.
A prominent Australian opposition lawmaker resigned from parliament in December after a series of allegations about his links to Chinese-aligned interests in the country.
On March 19, a separate group of scholars said in a letter to the parliament review that China was not trying to influence Australian politics, suggesting instead that the Australian government was fuelling a ""racialized narrative of a vast official Chinese conspiracy"" which did not exist.
The submissions by the two groups were signed, in some cases, by employees of the same university.
""Within a department you have people with different views on one topic,"" said Adam Ni, a China researcher at Australian National University's (ANU) Strategic and Defence Studies Centre and signatory to the submission this week. Three employees of his university signed the March 19 letter.
China's foreign ministry has said that China had no intention of interfering in Australia's internal affairs, or of using political funding to gain influence. 

In December, the Communist Party's official People's Daily described Australian media reports of Chinese interference as racist and baseless.

LONDON (Reuters) - British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn's path to the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street is not proving as smooth as the veteran socialist had hoped.
In June, with membership of his Labour Party on the rise, Prime Minister Theresa May bogged down in Brexit talks and her Conservative Party in chaos after an ill-judged snap election, Corbyn said he could be in office by Christmas.
Since then, May's team has gained confidence thanks to a breakthrough in talks to leave the European Union and broad international support for her tough stance against Moscow over a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain.
By contrast, the uneasy truce struck when May was on the ropes between Corbyn's left-wing supporters and centrist Labour lawmakers at odds with his Socialist beliefs has broken.
In the space of a few weeks, rows over Russia, Europe and anti-Semitism, three divisive issues that have dogged Corbyn throughout his long career on the left of British politics, have erupted within Labour.
First, the 68-year-old veteran peace campaigner came under fire from some Labour lawmakers for not standing shoulder-to-shoulder with May in blaming Russia directly for the poisoning - instead saying Moscow's culpability needed to be proven before rushing into a new Cold War.
Last week, Corbyn, instinctively wary of the EU which many leftists see as a capitalist club, was criticized by some prominent Labour lawmakers for sacking Owen Smith, a member of the party's ""shadow cabinet"", which mirrors the government.
Smith had said there should be a second referendum on leaving the European Union as Brexit would damage the economy and could threaten peace in Northern Ireland.
This week, British Jewish groups protested against Corbyn outside parliament accusing the Labour leader, a vocal supporter of Palestinian rights and critic of Israel, of failing to tackle anti-Semitism within Labour ranks.
""The question which is most alarming is the question of the Jewish protest against the Labour Party,"" Labour activist and Brexit campaigner Brendan Chilton told Reuters.
""This is a big issue because if the Labour Party can't be seen to be standing up for minority groups ... then you really have to ask what the Labour Party is for.""
IN CONTROL
Corbyn's supporters and even many of his critics do not believe the latest attacks spell the end of his term at the helm of Labour, a party he long criticized from within but few expected him to ever lead.
One source close to Corbyn said there was no reason for him to change his stance on Brexit or broader foreign policy issues.
""Why would there be?"" the source said on condition of anonymity. ""This isn't a threat to Jeremy's leadership.""
Corbyn was unexpectedly elected leader in 2015, riding a wave of enthusiasm for change that has spread across Europe with voters flocking to anti-establishment movements that have emerged since the 2008 global financial crisis.
Since then, Corbyn has cemented his control over the party's structures, able to entrench his move to the left after leading Labour to a surprising success in June's snap election by depriving May's Conservatives of a parliamentary majority.
His anti-austerity agenda, with pledges to plow money into Britain's stretched health service, schools, universities and social housing, struck a chord with voters jaded with the Conservative Party's rows over Brexit.
""The left of the party is in the ascendancy still, I don't think it has peaked,"" said Chilton. ""In that respect, Jeremy Corbyn and the leadership's command ... is still very much intact. It might be dented but it is still intact.""
Corbyn's team have long said centrists within the party, many of whose beliefs date back to when Labour was in power for more than a decade under Tony Blair, will seize on any opportunity to turn on their leader.
But the criticism of his stance over Russia and accusations of turning a blind eye to anti-Semitism have gone deeper than any previous attacks - trumping even the long-running debate within Labour over Britain's departure from the EU.
Corbyn may have to come down on Labour members whose support for Palestinians can translate into anti-Jewish comments. He might even face pressure to expel some long-standing supporters such as former London mayor Ken Livingstone. 
But Corbyn is unlikely to shift his position dramatically on Brexit, sources said.
One source close to his team of top policy advisers said Corbyn spends little time thinking about Brexit and had only agreed to move towards supporting a softer Brexit last month when aides convinced him it would ""fit with his world view"".
Corbyn's position on Russia over the nerve agent attack, however, has shifted.
""We can therefore draw no other conclusion ... than Russia has a direct or indirect responsibility,"" he said on Monday, as countries such as the United States, Germany and France expelled Russian diplomats in response to the poisoning.
His earlier prevarication over blaming Moscow has nevertheless spurred Conservative lawmakers to increase their criticism of a leader they say has, in the past, been too close to overseas organizations such as Palestinian group Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah.
Corbyn says he now regrets describing members of those groups as friends. Hamas and the military wing of Hezbollah are both designated as terrorist organizations by Britain.
And some Conservatives now see a chink in his armor.

""The historic fears the electorate have been warned about regarding Corbyn's fitness for high office are now being brought by current events into sharp focus,"" said Conservative lawmaker Andrew Bridgen.

GREAT YARMOUTH, England (Reuters) - Leaning over the counter of his seafood stall in the English seaside town of Great Yarmouth, Darran Nichols-George says those still moaning about the British vote to leave the European Union need to stop complaining. 
""At the end of the day we live in a democracy and therefore they've had the vote,"" said 51-year-old Nichols-George, peering over cartons of prawns, crabs, mussels and jellied eels.
""We voted out so we're going to go out.""
The fishmonger was one of the 17.4 million Britons who voted to quit the EU in a 2016 referendum, giving the Brexit campaign victory over the 16.1 million voters who wanted to stay.
Since then, Brexit has never been far from the headlines, from difficult talks with the EU and leaks of government forecasts that Britain will be worse off, to fish dumped into the River Thames by fishermen angry at European quotas.
A year before Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019, allegations that the main campaign for leaving the EU broke the law have revived memories of the bitter referendum battle.
Despite the issue dominating discussions in parliament and the pages of newspapers, voters' views seem entrenched as ever.
""People now think of themselves as Leavers or Remainers and see developments from that perspective,"" Sara Hobolt, a professor of politics at the London School of Economics, told Reuters. She estimates that 80 to 90 percent of Britons have not changed their minds since 2016. 
Some senior figures, such as former Prime Minister Tony Blair, have demanded a second referendum on the final deal agreed with the EU, so people could have a say in full knowledge of the possible outcome. But polls and research suggest there is no overwhelming support for another vote. 
Even if there was another plebiscite, the surveys show Britons are still deeply divided and most would probably vote the same way.
""Tony Blair -- he should keep his snout out,"" said retired 68-year-old Michael Cutting, who voted Leave and has lived in Great Yarmouth his whole life.
His view is shared by many in the rundown holiday resort, a once bustling fishing port some 140 miles (200 km) northeast of London, where paint peels off windswept ferris wheels and mainly elderly visitors wander past its ""Golden Mile"" sandy beach and drab amusement arcades.
""NO MESSING AROUND""
Great Yarmouth has the country's lowest percentage of college graduates -- 14.2 percent -- and a high rate of unemployment. In 2016, 71.5 percent of votes cast here were for Leave, putting it in one of the top 10 Brexit-supporting areas in the country.
""I think we should all get out of [the EU] now, straight away, no messing around,"" said Philip Blake, 60, between chopping cuts of prime British beef for display at his family-run butchers. 
""They're taking too long over it now. Just go. Hard Brexit, whatever, I don't mind.""
While an EU flag flies in tatters beside Great Yarmouth's seaside promenade, in the affluent university city of Norwich just 21 miles (34 km) away, the sentiment about Europe could hardly be more different but the intransigence is the same.
""I hate it, I really do,"" said Gaye Sorah, 59, who was close to tears at the thought of Brexit. ""One year to go, it’s a disaster. I just wish we could rewind the clock.""
Norwich, where tourists wander between the market's stalls, chattering in a variety of tongues while students cycle down medieval cobbled streets, bucked the trend for the region with 56 percent of voters backing staying in the EU.
Pro-EU posters adorn the whole foods stall owned by Gareth Butcher, 69, and his 66-year-old wife Jane Wirgman, who proudly wears a ""We are Europe"" badge.
""I could see no advantage in leaving, particularly not on a dream of empires past,"" Butcher said. ""I’ve not changed my mind at all and it's a source of some amusement to me that as the ramifications become clear ... that a lot of other people’s minds are being concentrated.""
Expressions of such regret are hard to find, but dishing out bags of chunky fries from his van in Great Yarmouth, Robin Platten thinks he was wrong to vote to leave. 
""I've been thinking maybe I might have made a mistake,"" Platten, 60, whose family have run the Brewer Chip Saloon takeaway stall in the town's market since 1902. 
""It's a great big tunnel with no light at the end of it, as far as I'm concerned,"" he told Reuters. ""I think maybe everybody should be given a second chance for the mistakes that they've made. But I don't think that's going to happen.""
Even some voters who backed remain have no desire to see the process dragging on, however -- despite their continued misgivings.

""I think we may as well get on with it now,"" said Kathryn Fabian, 20, a student in Norwich. ""I feel like we had our say back then, it's been decided. Let's just move on.""

It did not provide any details about the incident which it said took place on Sunday, saying only that it was a ""serious breach that constitutes a serious and flagrant violation of international law"".
On Monday, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain civil aviation authorities said two Qatari war planes had flown dangerously close to two civilian aircraft from the UAE while they were in Bahraini airspace, and that complaints would be lodged with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations' aviation agency.
Qatar denied the claim in a statement by its civil aviation authority saying that the UAE was trying to cover up for its own violations of Qatari airspace. 
The UAE, along with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, imposed travel, diplomatic and trade sanctions on Qatar last June, accusing it of supporting regional foe Iran as well as Islamist extremists. Qatar has denied the charge and accused the four countries of trying to make it conform to their foreign policy positions.
Qatar in June 2017 asked the ICAO to intervene after its Gulf neighbors closed their airspace to Qatar flights as part of the sanctions.

359,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 01:31AM ET</span>",Fewer Russian spies in U.S. but getting harder to track,"By Warren Strobel and John Walcott
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. decision to expel 60 alleged spies is unlikely to cripple Russian spying in the United States because others have wormed and hacked their way into American companies, schools, and even the government, current and former U.S. officials said.
Moscow's spy services still use the cover of embassies and consulates, as Washington does. But they also recruit Russian emigres, establish front companies, dispatch short-term travelers to the United States, recruit Americans, and penetrate computer networks, the officials said.
""Russia used to have one way of doing things. Now, Putin is - let a thousand flowers bloom,"" a former senior U.S. official said in a recent interview, describing Moscow's move to a more multifaceted approach under President Vladimir Putin, a former Soviet spy himself.
The FBI follows the movements and monitors the communications of suspected foreign spies, but the increased Russian presence and the advent of commercially available encrypted communications are an added challenge to the FBI's counter-espionage force, said the officials, some of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive topic.
As one U.S. official put it when asked if Russian spying is a harder target: ""It’s more complex now. The complexity comes in the techniques that can be used.""
While the CIA tracks foreign spies overseas and the National Security Agency monitors international communications, the FBI is responsible for spy-catching inside the United States.
The White House on Monday said it would expel 60 Russian diplomats, 12 of them at the U.N. mission, and close the Russian consulate in Seattle as part of a multi-nation response to the Kremlin's alleged nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain.
Briefing reporters, a senior U.S. official said there were ""well over"" 100 Russian spies posing as diplomats in the United States before the expulsion order.
A veteran U.S. official charged with keeping tabs on Russian espionage said the administration downplayed the number of suspected Russian spies working under diplomatic cover to avoid giving the Russians a clearer picture of how many people are under surveillance.
The actual number varies over time, but ""it averages more like 150 or so,"" the official said.
""We've got a very, very, very good counter-intelligence apparatus,"" said Robert Litt, a former general counsel for the U.S. Director of National Intelligence. ""There are a lot of people in the FBI whose job it is to track these people - and they're very good at it.""
TAKES TEN TO TANGO 
Still, it can take 10 or more U.S. trained FBI and local law enforcement officers to keep tabs on one trained spy for a 24-hour period - covering back entrances to buildings and multiple elevators, and being alert for changes in clothes, cars and even hairpieces, the same official said.
One Russian tactic is sending a large number of people, including just one or two intelligence officers, streaming out of a diplomatic mission at once, making it harder for the FBI to decide whom to follow, said a former U.S. intelligence officer, also speaking on the condition of anonymity.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). was one target of the Russian espionage operation in Seattle, U.S. officials familiar with the expulsions said. One goal was identifying targets for recruitment in the company's coding operations because the company's products are used in so many applications, they said.
Microsoft declined comment.
In 2010, Alexey Karetnikov, a 23-year-old Russian spy who had worked at testing computer code in Microsoft's Richmond, Wash., headquarters, was deported by an immigration judge.
Several of the officials traced the Kremlin's more aggressive spying approach to Putin's 2012 return to the presidency, and Moscow's 2014 seizure of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine.
""We observed a commensurate uptick in Russian intelligence and espionage activity in the U.S. and across Europe, although few analysts connected the dots,"" said Heather Conley, a former State Department official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.
Michael Rochford, a former FBI chief for espionage, said the mass expulsion of suspected spies posing as diplomats will affect Russia's security services and dent morale at their Moscow headquarters.
After past expulsions, he said, Russian spies have handed their operations over to officers who remain behind, or to ""illegals"" - long-term agents with no demonstrable connections to the Russian government.
The risk, he said, is that when Moscow replaces the expelled personnel, it will not be clear who the new spies are. 

""Sometimes it's better to know who they are and follow them,"" he said.

360,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 01:11AM ET</span>",Embattled Australian PM Turnbull forced to delay tax cut,"By Byron Kaye and Colin Packham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has been forced to delay introducing a bill to cut corporate tax due to a lack of Senate support, denying him a much-needed political victory as he struggles with poor polling a year from an election.
The conservative leader wanted to cut the corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 30 percent this week to shore up his white-collar base, after back-to-back scandals left him without several members of his ministry.
But Finance Minister Mathias Cormann told the upper house late on Tuesday he would now introduce the tax cut bill in the next week of parliament, which is scheduled for May, after failing to get the necessary votes from two independent Senators.
The delay leaves Turnbull without an upbeat message as he approaches a 30th straight Newspoll, a wide-watched opinion poll which has for the last 29 surveys had him trailing the Labor opposition.
Losing 30 Newspolls would be a symbolic blow for Turnbull since he used that benchmark to justify ousting former leader Tony Abbott in 2015. The next Newspoll is due out on April 8.
""The government's failure to pass the tax cuts means it has nothing to change the narrative that it is a government stuck in a rut,"" said Haydon Manning, a political science professor at Flinders University in South Australia.
""Turnbull desperately needs some good news after several months of negative headlines.""
Turnbull has struggled for months against a tide of long-running scandals over which he has seemed to have limited control. 
The second half of 2017 was dominated by a string of politician resignations amid questions about whether they held dual citizenship, a status which is banned for elected officials in Australia.
The start of 2018 was then consumed by then deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce's admission that he was expecting a child with a former employee. Joyce stood down in February after media reports he was the subject of an unrelated misconduct complaint.
Lobby group the Business Council of Australia (BCA) has been on a publicity offensive for corporate tax cuts in exchange for employing more people and higher wages.
The BCA and 10 chief executive officers wrote to all senators with this promise, but an internal BCA survey of its member CEOs found just one in five planned to use company tax cuts to pay higher wages or employ more people, the Australian Financial Review reported.
""I remain to be convinced that... I should support this bill in its current form,"" independent Senator Tim Storer, who joined parliament in January, told the upper house on Wednesday.

""This bill is a narrowly cast proposition of change (and) I have doubts that the decision to reduce company tax for all companies is prudent to undertake in the face of Australia’s budget deficit"", Storer added.

361,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 01:11AM ET</span>",Court hears police targeted Vatican's Pell before formal allegations made,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian police set up a task force targeting Cardinal George Pell before formal allegations of historical sexual offences were made, a court heard on Wednesday at a hearing to decide if the Vatican Treasurer will face trial on the charges.
Pell's lawyer said the police operation set up in 2013 failed to find any accuser until a year later, and when police did identify accusers, they failed to follow normal procedures in seeking corroboration for their allegations.
""Operation Tethering targeted Cardinal Pell, it was specific to Cardinal Pell?"" Pell's lawyer Robert Richter asked a police witness.
""That's my understanding,"" Victoria Police Detective Superintendent Paul Sheridan told the court.
""It was commenced as an intel probe into what offences might have occurred,"" Sheridan later said.
Key people who could have helped corroborate some of the evidence were not questioned until after police laid charges in June 2017, Richter said.
""That's astonishing in a serious investigation of a very, very high profile suspect,"" he told the court.
The detective who had first contact with some of Pell's accusers, David Rae, told the court he did not take notes from his first phone calls with them. He agreed with Richter's assertion that as a result there was no record that, in some instances, their allegations differed from their sworn written statements to police.
Some of Pell's accusers had made much more serious allegations about earlier sexual offences against them by other people in the church, but police decided not to pursue those, Richter told the court.
Sheridan said he did not know why those allegations were not pursued by the police.
The pre-trail hearing is due to end on Thursday.
Pell, 76, was summoned by Australian police in 2017 to face charges of historical sexual offences. Details of the charges associated with multiple accusers have not been made public.
Pell's lawyers have said he will plead not guilty to all charges. He is not required to enter a plea unless the magistrate determines there is cause for a full trial.

BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's visit to China, countering what had been growing estrangement between the Cold War allies, is likely to bolster Pyongyang's leverage going into a planned summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump.
For Chinese President Xi Jinping, the meeting with a long-troublesome neighbor ensures Beijing will not be left out of any deal struck between the United States and North and South Korea, experts said.
Months of frosty relations between Beijing and Pyongyang appeared suddenly to thaw with Kim's secretive trip, which saw the Chinese capital go into security lockdown as the mysterious North Korean delegation toured the city.
China said Kim had pledged to denuclearize the Korean peninsula while North Korean state media said Xi had accepted ""with pleasure"" an invitation to visit the North.
Kim's meeting with Xi strengthens North Korea's negotiating position by aligning the two nations ahead of Trump and Kim's planned meeting, said Wang Peng, a North Korea expert at the Charhar Institute in Beijing.
""North Korea is seeking assurances,"" he said. ""They want to quickly mend ties with China so that they have more leeway with the United States and they have more confidence in a good outcome.""
Analysts say North Korea has been hurt by tightening UN sanctions and would need Beijing's support for any softening of trade restrictions.
China wanted to show its importance as a partner to North Korea and ease worries about being sidelined in negotiations between the Koreas the United States.
“At the end of the day, China’s got huge interests and it was not comfortable not being at the table,” said Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie–Tsinghua Center in Beijing and a White House representative to the Six Party Talks from 2007-2009.
“Kim Jong Un’s first meeting with a head of state was with the Chinese president, which frankly from the Chinese perspective is exactly the right thing,” he added.
Trump's decision to hire hardliners such as incoming National Security Adviser John Bolton may have put added pressure on North Korea before the summit, said Han Suk-hee, professor of Chinese Studies at Yonsei University.
""It seems that North Korea is not ready to deal with the United States without support and help from its longtime ally China,"" he said. 
CLOSE ALLIES AGAIN?
China, as well as being North Korea's biggest trade partner, also has key strategic interest in assuring its isolated neighbor remains a buffer between it and South Korea, home to 28,500 U.S. troops. 
The two nations also have long-standing emotional and historic ties. China sometimes says they are ""blood brothers"", having fought side-by-side in the 1950-53 Korean War.
The two remained close allies in the decades immediately after the Korean War, but have drifted apart since Kim succeeded his late father.
North Korea's rapid escalation of nuclear tests and missile launches, combined with the assassination of Kim's half-brother last year in a Kuala Lumpur airport, brought diplomatic ties between Beijing and Pyongyang to historic lows.
With China signing on to ever-stricter United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang, North Korean state media took to openly criticizing and even threatening China.
""China is ... the only state willing and able to immediately ease North Korea's economic burden,"" said Christopher Green, senior adviser at International Crisis Group. North Korea was not prepared to give up its close relationship with China, much as it may chafe at its economic and political reliance on its much bigger neighbor, he added.
With North and South Korean relations improving during the Winter Olympics and plans for summits involving Trump, Moon and Kim, Beijing had reasons to resume contact with North Korea that had all but disappeared in the past year.
Xi stressed to Kim that past Chinese and North Korean leaders had always visited each other ""as often as relatives"", proposing the two leaders set up new channels of communication, China's official Xinhua news agency reported on Wednesday. 
Chinese state media has cast Beijing as crucial to forcing talks between Trump and Kim with its ""freeze for freeze"" pitch for North Korea to suspend nuclear and missile tests, and South Korea and the United States to suspend military drills.
""It's extremely difficult for the U.S. to map out a feasible denuclearization process that meets the North Korean preconditions without China's support and involvement,"" said Cheng Xiaohe, a North Korea expert at Renmin University in Beijing. ""China wants to show it cannot be left out."" 
A FRIEND IN NEED
Speaking at a banquet hosted by Xi, Kim Jong Un expressed gratitude to China for readily accepting his proposal to visit and all the efforts Chinese leaders made to pave the way for a successful visit in a short period of time, according to the North's official KCNA news agency.
China remains an advocate for a dual track of pressure and greater dialogue with North Korea, a position at odds with the Trump administration's maximal pressure approach.
That disagreement had left Beijing sidelined amid the escalating crisis, shunning a meeting of foreign ministers in Canada where leaders discussed how to pressure the North into backing down.
North Korea may also be taking advantage of tensions in U.S.-China relations over trade and the disputed South China Sea to draw in Beijing, Jia Qingguo, dean of the School of International Studies at China's Peking University 
""China wants North Korea to denuclearize but does not want to alienate North Korea at a time when China-U.S. relations are deteriorating very fast,"" said Jia, who has advised the government on foreign policy.
""We want a denuclearized North Korea, but at the same time we want North Korea to be a friend.""

363,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 12:31AM ET</span>","Investors in Vietnam learn to live with anti-corruption crackdown, some embrace it","By Mai Nguyen and James  Pearson  (LON:PSON)
HANOI (Reuters) - A crackdown on corruption in Vietnam unnerved some foreign investors when it intensified last year, but they are now getting much more sanguine about it and some say the business climate is improving as a result.
While the campaign by the government of Communist party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong has slowed some dealmaking in a country already plagued by Soviet-era red tape and bureaucracy, it has not deterred foreign investors from putting their money in Vietnam.
Vietnam's economy grew 6.8 percent last year, the strongest pace since 2010, while foreign direct inflows hit record highs for two years in a row, reaching $17.5 billion in 2017.
To some foreign investors the crackdown was long overdue. Nearly two-thirds of Vietnam's people have had to pay a bribe to get access to public services, Transparency International (TI) said in a 2017 report. Out of 16 Asian countries surveyed, only India fared worse.
The anti-corruption drive is a ""good signal"" to many foreign investors, said Somhatai Panichewa, chief executive of Amata VN Pcl, a unit of Thailand's top industrial estate operator Amata which in January announced major investments in Vietnam. 
""We think the government is serious about showing the public that investing in Vietnam is no longer 'know-who' but about 'know-how,'"" she said.
Some business risk analysts take a similar view. 
""Once the political thrust behind the arrests ... and their pattern could be more clearly identified, confidence was restored in the government's commitment to courting foreign investment,"" said Brendan Brady of consulting firm Eurasia. 
That doesn't mean the business conditions are easy for foreign investors. 
Executives on the ground have to navigate ""a minefield"" of new challenges, said Adam Sitkoff, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi. 
""Whether a result of corruption, protectionism, tax collection, or the government trying to pick winners and losers, our member companies often see areas where inconsistencies, inefficiencies, and unfair practices persist - and in some cases new unfair practices are being enacted,"" Sitkoff said. 
The government did not respond to requests for comment on the fallout from the crackdown or the circumstances in which it was launched. 
Over 100 people - mostly from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the banking or energy sectors - have been prosecuted, jailed and, in some cases, given death sentences in the anti-corruption campaign. 
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED
Government critics say the crackdown is politically motivated and has targeted those close to former prime minister Nguyen Tan Dung, who lost a power struggle in 2016 to Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong. But it has also shed light on deep-seated graft, mismanagement and nepotism within state-owned enterprises (SOEs) firms in the country at a time when a long-delayed privatization drive is accelerating. 
Trinh Xuan Thanh, a former chairman of a unit of the PetroVietnam state energy group, is now serving two life sentences for corruption after he fled the country and turned up in Hanoi in bizarre circumstances. Germany accused Hanoi of kidnapping him in a Cold-War style abduction in a Berlin park last year. 
Thanh's senior, ex-politburo member Dinh La Thang, was also sacked and became Vietnam's highest-ranking official to have been jailed for decades. He was given 13 years in prison and is again on trial facing another potential jail term.
""Officials have been more cautious after the corruption crackdown,"" said an executive of a small government enterprise, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject. 
""There have been quite a lot of requirements to cut down costs recently ... some are required, some are forced, some are achieved via technology enhancements that cut down on electricity costs, material costs etc,"" the executive said. 
Earlier this month, one of Vietnam's most sought after SOEs earmarked for privatization, telecoms firm MobiFone, was accused by a government investigating team of several violations in a bid to buy a 95 percent stake in a private pay-TV service called Audio Visual Global. 
The government inspectors described the deal as ""negatively affecting"" MobiFone's proposed privatization and proposed handing over the case to police. 
The two sides called off the deal just before the results of the investigations were announced. 
MobiFone has not responded to a request for comment. 
Calls to Audio Visual Global were not answered. 
The privatization of MobiFone has already been delayed for more than a decade and it could take even longer if the case is handed over to the police.
Vietnam has failed to meet its privatization targets in previous years but has plans for over 100 initial public offerings as well as partial stake sales in around 400 companies by 2020. 
""It seems that managers of SOEs - at least the most important ones - are now more cautious in their activity, in particular in relation to equitisation (partial privatization), divestment and so on,"" the European Chamber of Commerce said in a statement to Reuters. 
""The approval of line ministers is more systematically sought and the valuation of assets or shares is subject to more constraints"". 
Still, as Thang and Thanh went on trial in January, the government managed to raise about $740 million from selling partial stakes in three PetroVietnam units - despite the corruption attached to its name. 

And last December, the government raised a lofty $4.8 billion from selling 54 percent of brewer Sabeco.

PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haiti's president on Tuesday installed a seven-member high command for the new army, pledging that the force due to have 5,000 soldiers will help the impoverished Caribbean nation recover from natural disasters and rebuild infrastructure.
The country's army was disbanded in 1995 by then-president Jean-Bertrand Aristide after he returned to power following a coup, leaving the national police responsible for security.
The military's return has been a divisive topic in a country still suffering from a catastrophic earthquake and a fierce hurricane in recent years. Critics express concern the armed forces would meddle in politics and plunder vital resources.
However, President Jovenel Moise said on Tuesday the new army will respect the rule of law and serve the people.
""We know the military we had left a lot of bad memories in the minds of many Haitians, but this army will be different,"" Moise told Reuters after a meeting officers at the headquarters of the army across the street from the presidential palace.
Moise said the army would build roads, bridges, water dams, respond to natural disasters and promote economic development.
Lieutenant General Jodel Lessage has been named as acting commander in chief, with Brigadier General Sadrac Saintil, and five colonels - Jonas Jean, Jean-Robert Gabriel, Derby Guerrier, Joseph Jacques Thomas, and Fontane Beaubien - holding the remaining posts in the high command.
At present, the army consists of 150 soldiers and technical officers, trained in Ecuador, Defense Minister Herve Denis said.
Eventually, the army would reach 5,000 soldiers, Denis told Reuters, saying he would travel to other countries to seek cooperation for developing Haiti's military. He declined to name the countries.

Initially, authorities plan to recruit 500 soldiers for the armed forces, officials say.

Gernot Erler told the Passauer Neue Presse that Berlin's decision to send four diplomats back to Russia was a sign of solidarity with Britain after a nerve agent attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in England.
But despite Berlin's firm position with Moscow, channels of communication will remain open, Erler said in comments released on Wednesday.
""We have a clear and unshakeable position, but we want to stay in dialogue with Moscow,"" said Erler, a member of the left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD). ""We must do everything possible to prevent a new Cold War with Russia!""
European Union member Ireland as well as Moldova on Tuesday joined the list of countries expelling Russian diplomats over the attack on Skripal, a former double agent. The list includes 22 EU states; Britain led the way by kicking out 23 diplomats.
There has been broad consensus among German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the SPD, her junior coalition partners, on standing with Britain in taking a tough stance towards Moscow over the Skripal case.
Merkel has repeatedly called on Russia to cooperate in the investigation. Russia has denied any responsibility for the poisoning of Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia with a nerve toxin in the English city of Salisbury on March 4.
The opposition far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) rebuked Merkel's government on Tuesday for joining the Western expulsions of Russian diplomats after the attack on Skripal, arguing that this harmed Germany.
The AfD campaigned to end sanctions on Russia imposed by Germany and other Western countries over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis, and says it wants to improve relations with Russia.
""Despite economic interests in an end to the Russia sanctions, politics must take precedence,"" Erler said.

366,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2018 01:24AM ET</span>",Protest mounts over Malaysian PM's plan to redraw electoral map,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Hundreds of Malaysians protested on Wednesday against Prime Minister Najib Razak's plan to push through a controversial proposal to redraw electoral boundaries just months ahead of a general election that must be held by August.
The opposition and critics say Najib is trying to bulldoze through parliament changes to electoral boundaries they say would benefit his ruling coalition, facing arguably its toughest polls since independence nearly 61 years ago.
The government says the plan was drawn up by the Election Commision (EC), and not the government, and is free from political interference.
Opponents of the redrawing process say it shoves opposition-inclined voters into opposition-held seats to create super-constituencies and also reshapes constituencies to have more distinct ethnic majorities.
Protesters, rallying under the banner of pro-democracy group Bersih, gathered at a national monument close to the parliament wearing yellow t-shirts - Bersih's signature color - and carrying banners and placards. Opposition leaders also joined the protests.
Security was heightened at parliament's main gate, which was blocked by riot police, some armed with teargas guns.
Bersih aims to hand over a memorandum to parliament's speaker, outlining their reasons why he should scrap the government's motion seeking approval for its redelineation exercise.
""We totally do not agree with the (EC) report. This is the biggest cheating to ever happen,"" said Maria Chin Abdullah, the former chairwoman of Bersih. ""They want to bulldoze the report that contradicts the constitution, ignores the rule of law and manipulates the electoral rolls,” she said.
LOOMING ELECTION
Prime Minister Najib is expected to table the redelineation motion at 0330 GMT. It is widely expected to be passed today.
This is the final session of parliament before the legislative body is dissolved for elections. 
Electoral boundaries were last changed in 2003, under the leadership of then-premier Mahathir Mohamad. He, too, was accused of manipulating the process in favor of the ruling coalition, which has held power since independence from Britain in 1957.
Mahathir, 92, who led Malaysia for 22 years, is now running as the opposition's candidate for prime minister against Najib, his former protege.
Najib is under pressure to deliver an emphatic victory for his ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, as he grapples with a scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), and public anxiety over rising living costs.
Earlier this week, the government tabled a bill seeking to outlaw ""fake news"", which prescribes fines and up to 10 years in jail, raising more concern about media freedom in the wake of the 1MDB scandal.

The anti-fake news bill is expected to be debated and passed on Thursday.

In the attack in the southern state of Parana, a bullet left a hole in the body of a bus with a second hitting the glass of another vehicle. Nails had also been placed along the caravan's route, piercing the tires of one bus, the PT said. No one was injured.
Lula was president of Brazil from 2003 to 2010 and is seeking a third term in October elections, despite a corruption conviction that bars him for running for office. He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and pledged to fight the charges.
""What I'm seeing now is almost the rise of Nazism. What we are seeing is not political, because if they wanted to defeat the PT, they would go to the polls,"" Lula said, according to the PT statement.
""If they think doing this will scare us, they're wrong. It will motivate us.""

His buses have already been pelted with eggs and stones along the campaign trail.

Martin Vizcarra, who had been Peru's vice president, abruptly became president last week after Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned amid growing graft allegations.
A former Wall Street banker who once held U.S. citizenship, Kuczynski had been one of Maduro's most outspoken critics, deeming him a ""dictator"" and barring him from the Summit of the Americas that Peru will host on April 13-14.
Maduro vowed to attend the summit anyway, and his loyalists exulted over Kuczynski's downfall with a fireworks display last week.
But Vizcarra declined to weigh in on the dispute as he focuses on building support across Peru by promising to refocus the government's attention on domestic problems that had been neglected while Kuczynski struggled to remain in power.
After returning from a coastal region still reeling from severe floods last year, Vizcarra was asked at a news conference what he thought about Maduro's being banned from the summit.
""Our foreign policy is so delicate we must leave it in the hands of specialists,"" Vizcarra told journalists at the presidential palace. ""The foreign affairs ministry is taking the corresponding decisions that we'll support.""
The comment appeared to signal a more hands-off approach to foreign policy.
A spokesman in the foreign affairs ministry said its position of barring Maduro was unchanged, but noted that Vizcarra had not yet sat down to talk with top diplomatic officials.
Vizcarra promised a ""completely new"" Cabinet upon taking office on Friday, but has yet to name his foreign minister or other appointments. He said he would unveil his Cabinet next Monday.
Vizcarra said there would no changes to the agenda of the Summit of the Americas, which will celebrate ""democratic governance against corruption"" in a host country where three out of the four past presidents are subjects in graft probes.
U.S. President Donald Trump and other leaders in the Americas plan to attend the summit.
Vizcarra noted that various heads of state, starting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, had called him after he took office to reconfirm their attendance.
""We think the event in Peru is going to be a success,"" Vizcarra said.

The former governor of a small mining region, Vizcarra served as Peru's ambassador to Canada, as well as vice president, before he was called home to replace Kuczynski.

369,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 09:46PM ET</span>",How does Kim tell North Korea he's giving up nuclear weapons?,"By Josh Smith and Soyoung Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - State media calls North Korea's nuclear weapons a ""treasured sword of justice"".
Pyongyang has released commemorative stamps and built monuments in honor of its ballistic missile tests, while nuclear and rocket scientists have been named national heroes. 
For Kim Jong Un, fully giving up nuclear weapons would mean a dramatic reversal for an authoritarian leader who has not only staked his security on his nuclear arsenal, but also spent years publicly celebrating such weapons as an integral part of his regime’s legitimacy and power.
South Korean envoys who met Kim in Pyongyang early this month quoted Kim as saying he was ""committed to denuclearization"", and that he ""expressed his eagerness to meet U.S. President Donald Trump as soon as possible"".
Chinese officials who met with Kim in Beijing this week also said he committed to denuclearization, but initial North Korean state media reports on the visit did not mention the nuclear issue.
Absent any public confirmation from Pyongyang, analysts are skeptical Kim will suddenly give up the nuclear arsenal he and his family have spent decades developing. 
Instead, Kim is likely to seek a more nuanced and long-term approach that could allow him to emerge looking victorious in the minds of his people and domestic elites, they say.
""Kim Jong Un does not need to sell anything to the North Korean population, particularly because denuclearization is a process that will take at least 10 years to realistically achieve,"" said Michael Madden, an expert on North Korea leadership at Johns Hopkins University's 38 North website.
""Pyongyang most likely envisions ... a series of incremental agreements around this, rather than one or two large grand bargains.""
CONCESSIONS NEEDED
Former South Korean officials who have negotiated with the North in the past say such a pivot could be difficult, but not impossible - if the United States makes major concessions Kim Jong Un can take back and parade to his people.
""Kim Jong Un would seek to propagate the idea that he induced the U.S. and international community’s ‘surrender’ by having mastered nuclear weapons,"" said Kim Hyung-suk, who served as the South's vice unification minister between 2016 and 2017.
""If talks go well, sanctions are eased and the economy grows. Then the people would understand Kim’s denuclearization decision and become strongly supportive of it.""
That may not be the kind of deal Trump envisions as he plans to sit down with Kim sometime in May for an historic first summit between sitting leaders of the two countries.
Trump's new national security adviser, John Bolton, recently said Trump should insist any meeting he holds with Kim be focused squarely on how to eliminate that country's nuclear weapons program as quickly as possible. 
SILENCE IN PYONGYANG
The lack of comment from North Korean state media on the proposed talks between Kim and Trump was not unexpected, analysts said.
""It might reflect an ongoing internal discussion about how to deal with public opinion, certainly, although I would characterize that as a broader discussion of how to proceed overall,"" said Christopher Green, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group, which researches conflict.
Given the importance he has attached to the weapons, and the money poured into their development, Kim will have to tread carefully to ensure any talk of abandoning the nuclear program started by his grandfather and continued by his father wouldn't undermine his legitimacy at home, experts say.
To try to balance factions in his government, Kim Jong Un embraced a policy of ""byungjin,"" or simultaneous military and economic development, after he came to power in 2011. 
Since 2013, the pro-military factions have been ascendant, but a Trump summit could lend heft to arguments by officials who prefer to prioritize economic development, Green said.
A number of military authorities and other senior elites might be less receptive to denuclearization.
""For them, it’s unthinkable to ensure regime security with conventional forces alone, so they could object to Kim’s decision and continue to argue for keeping the bombs,"" said Kim Hyung-suk.
'FOREBEARERS' TEACHING'
According to South Korean and Chinese officials, Kim Jong Un told them denuclearizing the Korean peninsula was forebearers' teaching - a potential talking point if he does try to justify curtailing his much-vaunted nuclear program.
""It is our consistent stand to be committed to denuclearization on the peninsula, in accordance with the will of late President Kim Il Sung and late General Secretary Kim Jong Il,"" Kim told Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit this week, according to Chinese state media.
Kim Jong Un's father and grandfather both publicly promised not to pursue nuclear weapons, but secretly continued to develop the programs, culminating in the country's first nuclear test in 2006 under Kim Jong Il.
Even after that test, Kim Jong Il insisted in a 2007 summit with his South Korean counterpart that he didn't ""have the intention to own nuclear weapons"".
The history of failed negotiations with Pyongyang makes many observers, including former senior U.S. diplomat Evans Revere, skeptical the latest negotiations will be any different. 
In past talks, North Korea had said it could consider giving up its arsenal if the United States removes its troops from South Korea and withdraws its so-called ""nuclear umbrella"" of deterrence from South Korea and Japan, a stance Washington has found unacceptable.
""Those of us who have negotiated with the North Koreans know what they mean (by denuclearization),"" Revere said. 

""About the only thing that the North Korean leader might need to 'sell' to his people - and particularly to the military - is the idea of a 'freeze' on some elements of his program.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Rapid growth in private, unregulated security companies in Mexico has contributed to corruption, human rights abuses and excessive use of force, a report found on Tuesday, as the country suffers record levels of violence.
Lawlessness fueled by organized crime and corruption has spurred demand for private security services, a market worth billions of dollars, said the report by the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank. 
Some 8,000 private security companies, or up to 80 percent of the total, work outside government regulation, it found. Mexico recorded its highest murder rate since modern records began in 2017, and companies also face rising levels of burglary, robbery, cargo theft and extortion. 
The Inter-American Dialogue report said with the spread of private security firms ""a lack of oversight and enforcement has led to instances where corruption, human rights abuses and excessive use of force have gone unchecked.""
Red tape means registering a security company can be difficult and expensive, but there is little government enforcement of the rules, making it easy for small firms to spring up offering protection services, the report said.
""It's easier to just find a group of friends and start offering services to nearby local businesses that need security but can't afford the prices, plus tax, of the regulated firms,"" said James Bosworth, a researcher who worked on the report.
The proliferation of armed security personnel operating without oversight creates risks, the report said.
The National Security Council estimated that in 2016 the formal industry alone, which does not include unregulated security firms, was worth $1.5 billion - this is a 180 percent increase from 2012.
Bosworth said that even registered companies had little incentive to follow rules because the government rarely punishes those that commit abuses or lose track of firearms, which can end up in the hands of criminals.
The Defense Ministry, which issues firearms licenses to private security firms, and the Interior Ministry, which registers private security firms, did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
The Inter-American Dialogue warned that since violence, and with it the private security industry, could grow further, the government needed to punish those in the industry who commit abuses or violent acts that worsen the security environment.
    ""The goal of our recommendations is to improve security and human rights, not increase red tape for the sake of creating more paperwork,"" Bosworth said.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California's attorney general joined an investigation on Tuesday into this month's killing by Sacramento police of an unarmed black man standing in his grandparents' backyard, a death that sparked street protests.
The slaying of Stephon Clark, 22, was the latest in a long string of fatal shootings of black men by police officers that have raised questions about race and justice in the United States and fueled the Black Lives Matter movement.
""Due to the nature of this investigation, the extremely high emotions, anger and hurt in our city, I felt it was (in) the best interest of our entire community ... to ask the attorney general to be an independent part of this investigation,"" Sacramento Police Chief Daniel Hahn, the department's first black leader, said at a news conference.
Hours after the attorney general's announcement, protesters interrupted a city council meeting, chanting ""Stephon Clark"" as his brother Stevonte sat on the table in front of Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, a video posted on the website of CBS News showed. 
""The mayor and the city of Sacramento has failed all of you,"" his brother said to the crowded chamber.
Protesters then marched to Golden 1 Center, where the Sacramento Kings were about to tip off their NBA game against the Dallas Mavericks. They blocked the entrance and prevented many fans from entering the arena, much like they did last week, Sacramento media reported. 
Two Sacramento officers, responding to a report of someone shattering car windows, shot Clark in his grandparents' backyard on the night of March 18. Clark was holding an object the officers believed was a firearm, but after he fell they only found a cell phone by his body, police said. 
The family disputes police accounts that Clark was breaking car windows and plans to file a lawsuit against the city.
""We fully expect that the California Attorney General's Office will do a complete and thorough investigation that is fair and impartial,"" Benjamin Crump, the family's attorney, said in a statement. 
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said state investigators will act independently while overseeing the investigation, and will also review the Police Department's procedures and practices.

Sacramento police have not released the names of the two officers who opened fire, citing concerns about their safety. One officer is white and the other is black, and they have both been placed on leave, police said.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu left hospital late Tuesday following tests after suffering a high fever and a cough.
A Reuters witness saw Netanyahu's convoy leaving the hospital, and shortly after midnight Netanyahu said on Twitter: ""I am on my way home. Sure some rest and hot soup will put things right.""
""The prime minister has completed a series of tests and will be released home tonight,"" a statement from Netanyahu's office said earlier, adding: ""The tests showed a mild viral illness in the upper respiratory tract.""
Netanyahu's illness has come at a stressful time for the right-wing four-times prime minister, who is under police investigation for corruption in three different cases. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.
Netanyahu, 68, fell ill in mid-March and cancelled his public schedule for five consecutive days.
A security cabinet meeting scheduled for Wednesday will take place as planned, an Israeli official told Reuters. Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman will fill in for Netanyahu if he is unable to attend.
On Monday Netanyahu, his wife and son were questioned by police as part of an investigation into one of the corruption cases in which the prime minister is a suspect. 
In the two other cases police have already recommended that Netanyahu be charged with bribery. The final decision about whether to prosecute rests with the Israeli attorney general. That decision could be months away.
So far, partners in Netanyahu’s governing coalition have stood by him, saying they are awaiting the attorney general’s next moves. Political analysts say such support may erode if the investigations against Netanyahu intensify.

Surveys have shown that about half of Israelis believe the police over Netanyahu and think he should step down, while a third think he should remain in office. Support for Netanyahu's Likud party remains strong in opinion polls.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Senior North and South Korean parliamentarians shook hands and shared a toast to ""peace"" with Swiss wine on Tuesday, a Reuters witness said, in a rare gesture of friendship suggesting relations between their two countries are thawing.
South Korean MP and politician Young Chin shook hands with Ri Jong Hyok, director of North Korea's National Reunification Institute and deputy head of its Supreme People's Assembly.
They were attending the annual assembly in Geneva of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), an organization that brings together members of national parliaments from around the world. 
""This is to peace, and the reunion of the Korean peninsula. Thank you very much for your commitment,"" IPU secretary-general Martin Chungong of Cameroon, who organized the meeting, told the two delegations as they toasted.
The diplomatic detente began in January with the announcement that Pyongyang would send athletes to compete in the Winter Olympics held in the South, as part in a unified Korean team. It came after a year in which Pyongyang staged several missile launches and its biggest-ever nuclear test.
As Chungong and the two Korean parliamentarians put down their glasses to link arms and shake hands again, the IPU chief said: ""This is a symbol of their commitment to working together... If there are issues that are of concern to you that you want me to help with, the IPU to help with, you can count on the institution's support.""
Ri, speaking through an interpreter, told the private gathering earlier: ""You know the Secretary-General of the IPU makes a great contribution to the favorable situation now between the North and South.""
A source familiar with the matter said earlier on Tuesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was part of a secretive delegation that arrived in Beijing by train on Monday and left on Tuesday, in what would his first known journey abroad since he assumed power in 2011.
Beijing is the main ally of secretive and isolated North Korea, as well as its biggest trading partner.
In a speech to the IPU assembly on Monday, Ri said that North Korea's policy of seeking better ties with the South was enjoying broad international support, and also called on the United States to halt its sanctions and pressure.

Chin, whose remarks were translated by the North Korean interpreter, told Ri on Tuesday: ""I think the next time on, there might be a higher step for us to have an easy contact.""

374,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 06:46PM ET</span>",Trump's travel ban imperils U.S. citizen with cancer,"By Mica Rosenberg
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Maziar Hashemi, a naturalized U.S. citizen who lives in Massachusetts, has been told by doctors that his best hope for surviving a rare form of blood cancer is a bone marrow transplant. 
President Donald Trump’s travel ban could make that impossible.
Bone marrow transplants require a close match between donor and recipient. A few months after his diagnosis last September, Hashemi, 60, learned that his brother in Iran, Kamiar Hashemi, was a rare 100-percent match. The only problem was Kamiar’s nationality.
The latest travel ban, issued as a presidential proclamation and implemented on December 8 after months of legal wrangling, bars most travelers to the United States from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea, as well as certain government officials from Venezuela. Although the ban allows for case-by-case waivers to be granted, including for medical need, Kamiar Hashemi has so far been denied a visa. 
Attorneys who regularly deal with visa issues say the waiver process is opaque. Visa applicants aren’t allowed to apply for waivers; they are simply granted or not without explanation. U.S. officials won't say how they make their decisions or how long they generally take.
A U.S. State Department official told Reuters that since the ban took effect, more than 375 waivers have been approved but he declined to say how many total visa applications have been filed from countries covered by the ban. He said he could not comment on the specifics of Hashemi’s case.
Kamiar Hashemi began the visa application process soon after learning he was a match for his brother. In February, the 57-year-old small business owner traveled to Armenia to be interviewed at the U.S. embassy there, since there is no embassy in Iran. 
Later on the day of the interview, Kamiar’s brother back in Massachusetts checked the status of the application on the State Department's website. A pop-up window announced in bright blue letters: ""Refused.""
Waivers can later be granted to applicants initially refused for visas, according to the State Department, so Maziar Hashemi continued checking the website each day, but his brother’s status hasn’t changed. He hired an immigration lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai, hoping she might smooth the way. 
‘TRANSPARENT AS MUD’
The Trump administration has said travel restrictions are needed to protect the United States from terrorism.
Critics have challenged the latest ban, as they did previous versions, saying that it discriminates against Muslims. Six of the eight countries included in the current ban are majority Muslim. 
Under the current proclamation, waivers can be granted in cases where denying entry would cause undue hardship, when the individual is found not to be a threat and when their entry is in the national interest. 
The proclamation lists ten examples of situations in which an applicant might be eligible for a waiver. One reason mentioned is an applicant’s need for urgent medical care, something that comes close but doesn’t exactly fit the Hashemis’ situation, since it isn’t Kamiar Hashemi, himself, in urgent need.
The State Department has declined to provide details of how waiver decisions are made beyond some general answers to frequently asked questions posted on its website. But a State Department letter obtained by Reuters earlier this month said ""there is no waiver form to be completed"" and that applicants who fall into the categories outlined in the proclamation ""must be considered"" for one.
“The process is as transparent as mud,” said Hashemi’s attorney Khanbabai. “There are no clear guidelines. It’s difficult to figure out what the process is and who is actually doing the processing.”
Nevertheless, Khanbabai submitted a packet of information on the Hashemis’ behalf to the embassy on March 19, including a letter from Massachusetts General Hospital explaining that a perfect match for a bone marrow transplant is very rare and could provide the only viable treatment for Maziar Hashemi’s Myelodysplastic syndrome.
Worried about the ticking clock, Kamiar Hashemi looked into traveling to India to have his bone marrow harvested there and rushed to the United States, but that option was also thwarted. 
A non-profit organization trying to facilitate the transfer, Be The Match, said it had to pull out after its legal team concluded that Kamiar’s bone marrow couldn’t be exported to the United States because of U.S. sanctions on Iranian exports. 
""Can you imagine that the cells of an Iranian needed in order to help a U.S. citizen are embargoed?"" said Maziar Hashemi, a civil engineer who has lived in the United States since the 1970s. 

""It is just unfair,"" he said in a phone interview. ""I cannot wait much longer.""

375,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",Macron lawmaker seeks parliamentary inquiry over arms sales to Saudi-led coalition,"PARIS (Reuters) - A lawmaker in President Emmanuel Macron's party is asking for a parliamentary investigation into the legality of French weapons sales to a Saudi-led coalition over concerns the arms are being used to kill civilians in Yemen.
Pressure has been mounting on Macron to scale back military support for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which are leading the coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi group that controls most of northern Yemen and the capital Sanaa.
The conflict has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced more than three million.
""I am submitting a request for a commission of inquiry knowing that France ratified the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty,"" Sebastien Nadot, a lawmaker elected last year as part of hundreds of new parliamentarians that form Macron's majority, told Reuters on Tuesday.
""On the question of French weapons being used against civilian populations in Yemen, I want to know if France is respecting its international commitments.""
It remains to be seen whether Nadot will get the necessary backing from other lawmakers to set up the inquiry committee. 
The move by Nadot is surprising in that Macron has faced little opposition in parliament since coming to power last year and commands an overwhelming majority, with few of his lawmakers willing to question the executive's decisions.
Unlike many of its allies, French export licensing procedures have no parliamentary checks or balances. They are approved through a committee headed by the prime minister that includes the foreign, defence and economy ministries.
Details of licenses are not public and, once approved, are rarely reviewed.
""Parliament must be able to control whether these weapons are sold in respect of international law,"" Nadot said.
""If we are just a transmission belt, and not (a) body of control and evaluation, then abstention (in elections) has a bright future ahead of it.""
Seventy-five percent of French people want Macron to suspend arms exports to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, a YouGov poll showed on Monday. Several rights groups have warned of possible legal action if the government does not halt its sales.
France is the world's third biggest arms exporter and counts the two countries among its biggest purchasers.

While some European countries, notably Germany, have curtailed ties with the Saudi-led military coalition, France, Britain and the United States have not followed suit.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, the largest party in parliament after this month's election, should try to form a government with its far-right rivals the League, two of its senior politicians said on Tuesday.
The election produced a hung parliament and 5-Star has said it is willing to talk to all parties in parliament to try to form a government. However, the parliamentarians told Reuters they believed the only realistic hope of a coalition was with the League.
While many obstacles lie in the way of such an alliance, if a deal were to be struck it would likely cause concern in Brussels and among investors, due to both parties' hostility to EU rules on areas including budgets, trade and immigration.
The League has claimed the right to name the prime minister because it is the leading party in a centre-right bloc that won the most seats in parliament. Its leader, Matteo Salvini, said on Monday he was ready to talk to 5-Star about a coalition.
""Salvini is doing everything right and there are plenty of policies we can agree on,"" said a prominent 5-Star senator.
Salvini will meet 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio next week in parliament, the League leader said in a television interview on Tuesday.
Both lawmakers who spoke to Reuters said they were encouraged by a change of stance from Salvini this week, who showed a willingness to consider income support for the poor, which is 5-Star's flagship policy.
Both asked not to be named because of the delicate state of negotiations on trying to put together a ruling coalition.
They dismissed the view expressed by some commentators that 5-Star's voters, who come mainly from the south, would be hostile to a deal with the League because its power base is in the rich north.
""Salvini has changed the League's identity, and he was elected in a southern seat himself,"" one said. ""In any case, we are strongest in the south and we would guarantee the right policies for the south,"" the parliamentarian added.
""What our voters want most is that we should be in government,"" said the other. Both lawmakers were elected in the south.
5-Star won 33 percent of the vote in the election, compared with 17 percent for the League and 37 percent for the centre-right bloc as a whole, which includes former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) and the right-wing Brothers of Italy. 
MUTUAL PRAISE
The parties voted together on Saturday to elect the speakers of the two houses of parliament, and Salvini and Di Maio then praised each other for sticking to their word and proving their trustworthiness.
Despite this, there are still some major sticking points in the way of them hooking up, not least of which is Berlusconi's presence in the centre-right coalition.
5-Star, which bases its appeal on a pledge to clean up politics, is fiercely hostile to the four-times prime minister, who has a conviction for tax fraud and is on trial in another case for allegedly bribing witnesses.
""I would not find it acceptable for us to have a role in any government which includes Forza Italia,"" one of the lawmakers said. Salvini has vowed not to abandon his allies, saying such a shift would betray voters who backed the bloc at the ballot box.
Salvini repeated on Tuesday that he had no plans to abandon his coalition partners to form a government with 5-Star without them.
Another obstacle is who should become prime minister. 
Salvini said on Monday he was ready to drop his claim if necessary, but he had previously said the candidate should in any case come from the center right, and it is far from clear that he would be willing to accept Di Maio. 
5-Star appears less flexible.
""It's the will of the people,"" Di Maio said on the party's blog about him being named prime minister, underscoring the fact that 5-Star won nearly double the votes as the League.
""Di Maio cannot say or me or nothing,"" Salvini said during the recording of a Porta a Porta (Door to Door) talk show on RAI state television.

Paris (Reuters) - Redouane Lakdim, the Islamist gunman who killed four people in southern France last week, had been summoned by the country's domestic spy agency prior to the attack for an evaluation to see if he should remain on a government watch list, a source said.
Moroccan-born Lakdim, who was shot dead by security forces as they stormed a supermarket where he was holding hostages, had been on the intelligence services' official Fiche S watch list since 2014, prosecutor Francois Molins said on Monday. He was believed to have links to local Salafists, Molins said, but had shown no signs of preparing an attack. 
Lakdim was sent a letter requiring him to fix a meeting with security agents at the local police headquarters in his hometown of Carcassonne, the source close to the investigation said on Tuesday. 
It was the first time that security officials had decided to assess Lakdim face-to-face to determine whether he still posed a risk, RTL radio reported. No evidence has surfaced that the summons served as a catalyst for the attack.
The surveillance of Lakdim ""was still in progress in March, 2018, and there had been no warning signs he was preparing an attack, nor that he had any ambitions to travel to the Iraqi-Syrian conflict zone"", Molins told a news conference on Monday. 
On Friday morning, Lakdim held up a car in Carcassonne, wounding the driver and shooting dead his passenger. He then fired on a group of gendarmes jogging outside their barracks before seizing hostages at the supermarket in nearby Trebes.
The attack, the first since President Emmanuel Macron toughened security legislation and ended a two-year state of emergency in November, has left the intelligence services scrambling to see if any red flags were missed. 
Molins said that notebook scribblings found in Lakdim's house pointed to a man who wanted to pledge allegiance to Islamic State and was ready to die for the militant group. 
Some 26,000 individuals suspected of posing a security risk to France are on the Fiche S watch list, of whom about 10,000 are believed to have been radicalised, sometimes in Salafist mosques, online or abroad. 
Lakdim was placed on the watch list because he was suspected of having ties with a person belonging to a Salafist network. 
""He was not considered particularly dangerous,"" another source familiar with the investigation into the attack told Reuters.
Some of Macron's opponents have accused the 40-year-old president, a former investment banker, of being soft on security. Laurent Wauquiez, leader of the main opposition party, The Republicans, urged Macron to expel all foreigners on the watch list and detain all others.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Tuesday said such measures would violate civil liberties.
""In France, no one should be deprived of their freedom because of suspicions,"" Philippe told lawmakers.

ZINTAN, Libya (Reuters) - Communities drawn into conflict after Libya's 2011 uprising have no choice but to reconcile if the country is to recover, said the mayor of a town that was left isolated following fighting four years ago. 
Mustafa al-Baroni, mayor of the western town of Zintan, also warned that politicians from rival bodies which have overrun their terms are scheming to cling to power, blocking progress at a local level. 
Zintan emerged as an important military power-base in the NATO-backed uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi seven years ago. However, in 2014 its forces lost their footing in the capital Tripoli to rivals from western Libyan towns including Misrata as the conflict escalated. 
Zintan's political and military allies moved to the east, but the town of 50,000 has since been working to restore relations with its neighbors and with Tripoli, now home to a U.N.-backed government that arrived in 2016. A rival government is based in eastern Libya.
""We believe strongly that national reconciliation is the gateway for building Libya. We as Libyans have to reconcile,"" Baroni said in an interview. 
After the fighting in 2014, movement between Zintan and Tripoli -- normally just two hours away by road -- was severely restricted. 
Baroni said he still drives for more than 10 hours to Tunis for meetings with foreign representatives, rather than flying from the capital. 
But he said military tensions in Tripoli and surrounding areas had eased, despite recent activity by Zintan forces on the western outskirts of the capital.
Many Zintan families that were displaced from Tripoli in 2014 have since returned. Reconciliation with Misrata is continuing gradually, Baroni said.
""We are making efforts for comprehensive national reconciliation locally, in the western region and in the south as best we can.""
Due to the continuing split between the governments and assemblies based in Tripoli and the east, the United Nations has been trying to amend a stalled 2015 peace deal and prepare for elections later this year. 
But Baroni warned that politicians on both sides of the country were trying to block progress toward polls, including local elections for mayors whose terms are about to expire. 
""There are some elements in Libya that the Libyan people have entrusted with their future who do not want this solution,"" he said. ""They want to stay in power forever and they have privileges and don't feel the suffering of the Libyan people.""
Libya's economy has been crippled since oil production was disrupted by blockades and conflict from 2013. Oil output recovered last year to more than one million barrels per day, partly due to production gains from the lifting of a pipeline blockade near Zintan.
But cash is scarce across the country and public services are in a state of collapse. Zintan, a low-rise town that sits on a hilltop ridge, has no drinking water network, Baroni said. 
""We are exporting oil every day,"" said Baroni. ""Where is this money?""
""There can be no stability in Libya if there is no justice in the distribution of Libya's wealth.""

379,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",Germany's AfD slams Merkel's expulsions of Russian diplomats in spy row,"By Madeline Chambers
BERLIN (Reuters) - The opposition far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) rebuked Angela Merkel's government for joining Western expulsions of Russian diplomats after an attack on a former Russian spy in Britain, arguing that this harmed Germany. 
Berlin said on Monday it was sending four diplomats back to Russia as part of 100 expulsions by the U.S. and European countries.
""Germany has nothing to win and much to lose if it lets itself be drawn into a new Cold War by rabble rousers and it wilfully blocks diplomatic channels,"" said Alexander Gauland, co-leader of the AfD, the biggest opposition party. 
Britain blames Russia for a nerve agent attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the southern English city of Salisbury where they were found unconscious on March 4. They are still critically ill. Moscow has denied being behind the attack.
There has been broad consensus among Merkel's conservatives and her Social Democrat (SPD) junior partners to back Britain in taking a tough stance against Moscow in the case and Merkel has repeatedly called on Russia to cooperate in the investigation.
But Gauland said the German government, driven by a false sense of solidarity, was basing its actions only on suspicions.
""The claims made by the British government are unproven,"" he said in a statement on Tuesday, adding it was inappropriate to take such serious measures without a factual basis.
""Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has, in contrast to other EU states, shown no backbone towards British assumptions and has acted against German interests,"" he said.
The AfD, which entered parliament after winning almost 13 percent of the vote in a Sept. 24 election, has wooed supporters with anti-establishment rhetoric and anti-immigrant policies.
It has also won strong support among the roughly 3 million people in Germany with roots in Russia and the former Soviet Union. Some media have reported that about one third of the AfD's support comes from the Russian-speaking community.
The party campaigned to end sanctions on Russia imposed by Germany and other Western countries over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis and says it wants to improve relations with Russia.
While Maas, a member of the SPD, has made clear he backs the expulsions, some in his party are more cautious.
Matthias Platzeck, a former leader of the SPD and head of the German-Russian Forum, said jumping to conclusions with no proof ""shakes many peoples' understanding of the law and of democracy"". He wanted to see proof against Russia.
Former SPD Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a personal friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has also drawn criticism for continuing his close ties with Russia, including his role as chairman of Russia's biggest oil producer Rosneft. 

Schroeder, chancellor from 1998 to 2005, is ridiculed for agreeing more than a decade ago to a description of Putin as a ""flawless democrat"".

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Three days after European Union leaders left a summit in Brussels with a discreet yet vague agreement to expel Russian diplomats over a nerve agent attack on British soil, envoys met back to share details before an afternoon deadline.
Unveiling national expulsion lists at a closed-door meeting on Monday, the 28 ambassadors from the EU's member states were unaware of the scale of their plan to isolate Moscow: more than half the bloc's governments had joined the West's most sweeping expulsion of Russian diplomats since the Cold War.
""It wasn't until the meeting that we saw the plans, that we could say we had agreed something meaningful, unprecedented,"" one senior EU diplomat told Reuters, recounting events echoed by four other diplomats and officials. 
Coupled with U.S. expulsions that were the result of days of intense diplomacy by Washington, London and later Paris, EU governments pulled off what seemed unthinkable a week before, and all in support of a country quitting the bloc in 2019.
But EU capitals wanted to demonstrate that, Brexit notwithstanding, security ties were paramount. ""Russian interference is bigger than Brexit, it goes way beyond that,"" a second EU diplomat said.
In total, more than 100 Russian diplomats are being removed from over 20 countries, including 15 members of the European Union, which has long been split on how best to handle Russia.
Moscow denies any involvement in the attempted murder of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, who were found slumped on a public bench in the English city of Salisbury on March 4.
The show of EU support for Britain was all the more surprising because, in the weeks before the attack, the tone between London and Brussels had deteriorated as Britain sought new post-Brexit trade ties that the EU said were unworkable. 
SPY (NYSE:SPY) NETWORK
However, for the EU to unexpectedly come together, it still took a concerted British diplomatic effort with U.S. support.
From NATO via discussions with European Union foreign ministers to the EU's two-day March 22-23 summit, the public focus was to be on a statement condemning Russia. 
Behind the scenes, Prime Minister Theresa May had stronger demands: EU help in disrupting a Russian network of spies working under diplomatic cover in Europe.
Assistance first came from Baltic allies eager for Britain's military protection against Russia, while U.S. officials had done groundwork by visiting some European capitals to sound out support for their plans to expel 60 Russian diplomats.
Crucially, before the EU summit got under way in the egg-shaped glass Europa building in Brussels' European quarter, a regular meeting of the six Baltic and Nordic EU countries - Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Denmark, Sweden and Finland - opened up their forum to May.
There she made a plea for countries to consider the expulsion of Russian diplomats, sharing classified evidence on Russia's involvement. Sweden and Finland, which maintain a traditional neutrality and are not NATO members like Denmark, signaled they might join the initiative.
Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite went into the two-day EU summit on Thursday musing publicly that she could expel Russian diplomats. Privately, she had Poland's agreement to join the move. Latvia, Estonia and France had also shown interest.
LIGHTS OUT
With the summit under way, May took her plea just before dinner to French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. May had only one thing on her mind, a third diplomat said. ""The evidence she presented Merkel and Macron was very strong.""
The meeting did not start well, however. The lights went out briefly in the British suite as news photographers crowded in for a brief photo call, with someone unknowingly leaning on the light switch and plunging the trio into darkness.
But after everyone else had left the room and the lights came back on, May won their agreement that something must be done about Russia, which NATO has accused of trying to undermine the West with a campaign of disinformation, cyber attacks and covert action such as the Skripal poisoning.
Merkel also agreed that London would not have to wait for the results of tests on samples of the Salisbury nerve toxin from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) before Europe would act, mainly because Russia is a member of the watchdog and was seen as uncooperative in the inquiry.
Then, over scallops and rack of lamb on Thursday night, EU leaders discussed Russia for three-and-a-half hours, first attempting to agree a formal statement attributing blame for the toxin attack to Moscow.
With tough wording proposed by France and Ireland, that came around midnight and was a breakthrough, overcoming Greek resistance to criticism of Russia, and about as far as many diplomats had expected discussions to lead.
But May pressed on, sharing more intelligence that proved that ""only one country could have done it"", she told the room.
Several leaders were looking around to see who else might join the expulsions when France's Macron spoke up in support. Then Merkel, having received backing from her government coalition partner back in Berlin, joined too.

""That was the turning point,"" a fourth diplomat said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Turkish banker who was found guilty of helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions following a trial that featured accusations of corruption against top Turkish officials asked a U.S. judge on Monday to ""temper justice with mercy"" and impose a lenient sentence.
In a filing in Manhattan federal court, lawyers for Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a manager at Turkey's majority state-owned Halkbank, said that federal guidelines would suggest a sentence of 46 to 57 months, and that the sentence should be ""dramatically below"" that. Atilla has already been in jail for about 12 months.
Atilla, 47, is scheduled to be sentenced on April 11 by U.S. District Judge Richard Berman. Prosecutors are expected to make their case for what Atilla's sentence should be in a court filing next Monday.
Atilla's lawyers said in Monday's filing that Atilla was the only foreign banker ever prosecuted under the U.S. sanctions law, and that a heavy sentence would be unfair when other bankers were not punished at all.
They argued that Atilla's conduct was ""less culpable than that of someone who owes allegiance to the United States,"" and that ""thwarting the foreign policy objectives of the United States is not self-evidently wrong"" for someone without ties to the country.
They said that Atilla had already suffered a severe penalty because his conviction had ""shattered"" his career.
Atilla was arrested in New York in March 2017. He was found guilty of conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions law on Jan. 3 after a four-week trial.
Prosecutors charged that beginning around 2012, Atilla took part in a scheme to let Iran spend its oil and gas revenues abroad using fraudulent gold and food transactions through Halkbank.
At the center of the scheme, prosecutors said, was Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab, who had been arrested in Florida a year earlier. Zarrab pleaded guilty and agreed to testify for prosecutors.
Atilla, testifying in his own defense, denied that he took part in any scheme.
Zarrab testified that he bribed Turkish officials, and that Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan personally signed off on parts of the scheme while he was the country's prime minister.
The case has strained relations between the United States and Turkey, which are NATO allies.
During the trial, Erdogan called the case a ""plot against Turkey"" based on evidence fabricated by followers of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom he has also blamed for a failed 2016 coup attempt.

382,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>","Cuba's Communist Party admits errors, slowdown in reforms","By Sarah Marsh
HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba's Communist Party admitted a slowdown and errors in its implementation of Raul Castro's market-style reforms, just weeks before he steps down from the presidency, but vowed to continue updating the Soviet-style command economy.
The party central committee held a plenary session to discuss the state of reforms undertaken during Castro's 10-year presidential mandate to open up the ailing economy and give the private sector and foreign investment greater roles.
Castro, who steps down as president on April 19, presided over the plenary which took place this week. The 86-year old will remain head of the party, the country's guiding political force, until 2021.
""Despite the errors and insufficiencies recognized in this plenary, the situation is more favorable than a few years ago,"" Castro, 86, was quoted as saying by party newspaper Granma.
Reforms were implemented swiftly in the first three years since being agreed in 2011, the head of the party's reform commission Marino Murillo was cited as saying.
The number of self-employed workers in the Caribbean island nation of 11.2 million residents has more than tripled to around 580,000 workers.
But implementation has slowed in the last two years due to the complexity of the process, mistakes in oversight, a lack of financial backing and low engagement of the bureaucracy, Murillo said. The party was also deliberately implementing reforms slowly to ensure they would not marginalize anyone.
The government last year froze the issuance of licenses for an important set of private sector activities as it sought to root out malpractices such as purchases on the black market and to improve regulation. 
The 142-member central committee discussed the lack of a fiscal culture and accountancy tools to make a serious economic analysis in Cuba as well as difficulties communicating the complex process.
Many Cubans, whose expectations were raised by Castro's reforms, have felt frustrated by the slowdown that they believe means Havana is not truly committed to updating the economy.
The government said late last year, for example, it would limit licenses to one per person going forwards - a move that could limit Cubans' entrepreneurial ambitions. 
Yet it did not address key private sector concerns like the lack of a wholesale market or ability to import or export.

Havana has also backtracked on reforms in the key agricultural sector over the last few years, once more assigning resources, setting prices and controlling most distribution.

Romania's parliament was holding a special session to mark the 100th anniversary of Moldova joining the then-kingdom of Romania after World War One.
Moldova was then annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 and became an independent state in 1991.
The small, landlocked country is politically divided between supporters of closer ties with Moscow and those who want Moldova eventually to follow Romania, its much larger southern neighbor, into the European Union and NATO.
Most Moldovans speak Romanian and have close cultural ties with Romania but the country also has a large minority of Russian speakers.
""Romania's parliament... considers as fully legitimate the desire of those citizens of the Republic of Moldova who support the unification of the two states,"" the resolution backed by lawmakers said.
""We underline that such an act would depend on their will and we declare that Romania and its citizens are, and will always be, ready to welcome any organic move to reunification by Moldovan citizens as an expression of their sovereign will.""
Barely a fifth of Moldovans favor reunification with Romania, according to an opinion poll conducted in December by the Moldovan Institute for Public Policies, an independent think-tank.
""The majority of citizens today want Moldova as an independent state,"" the president of Moldova's parliament, Andrian Candu, in Bucharest for the commemoration of the anniversary, told reporters after the vote.
""But I want to assure you that Romania is increasingly more present in Moldova through the projects supported by the government and political class.""
Romania has energy projects in the country and supports its long-term process of trying to join the EU. 
Moldova's government, which strongly backs closer ties with the EU and the United States, is often at loggerheads with the country's pro-Russian president, Igor Dodon, who wants it to join a Moscow-led customs union.

Candu, who sides with the government, said Moldova faced many challenges ahead of a planned parliamentary election in November, adding: ""We must be very careful to keep the country whole and on the path to the European Union.""

Umar Haque, 25, showed the children beheading videos and other violent militant propaganda, forced them to re-enact deadly attacks on the British capital and made them role-play attacking police officers.
""His plan was to create an army of children to assist with multiple terrorist attacks throughout London,"" said Dean Haydon, head of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command. ""He tried and he did, we believe, radicalize vulnerable children from the ages of 11 to 14.""
Despite having no qualifications and being employed as an administrator, police say Haque used the guise of teaching Islamic studies to groom 110 children into becoming militants at the Lantern of Knowledge, a small private Islamic school, and at a madrassa connected to the Ripple Road Mosque in east London.
His intention was to use them to attack London targets such as Big Ben, soldiers from the Queen's Guards, a large shopping center, banks, and media stations, prosecutors said at his trial.
Believed to have been self-radicalized online, Haque was inspired by an attack in March last year when Khalid Masood ploughed a rented car into pedestrians on London's Westminster Bridge, killing four, before stabbing to death a police officer in the grounds of parliament.

Haque was found guilty at London's Old Bailey Court earlier this month of several offences including preparing terrorist acts, having previously pleaded guilty to four charges.

386,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 09:52PM ET</span>",May calls for 'long-term response' to Russia after spy poisoning,"By William James
LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May called on Tuesday for a ""long-term response"" by the West to the security threat from Russia as NATO followed member states in expelling Russian diplomats over the poisoning of a double agent in England.
In the most sweeping such action against Moscow since the height of the Cold War, the United States and European Union members plan to expel scores of Russian diplomats in action against the Kremlin for the nerve agent attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter which they have blamed on Russia.
Russia, which denies any part in the March 4 attack on the Skripals, says the West's action is a ""provocative gesture"" and has said it will respond.
The coordinated action among Western allies is seen as a huge diplomatic coup for May whose country is preparing to exit the EU bloc and may have had doubts about how much support she could count on.
Speaking to senior cabinet members in London on Tuesday, May said countries had acted against Russia not just out of solidarity but because they recognized the threat it posed.
""Yesterday was a significant moment in our response to this reckless act of aggression, but there is still more to be done as we work with international partners on a long-term response to the challenge posed by Russia,"" her spokesman reported May as saying.
The U.S.-led NATO alliance followed suit announcing on Tuesday it was expelling seven diplomats from Russia's mission at alliance headquarters in Brussels and blocking the appointment of three others, thus cutting the size of the mission to 20 people from 30.
""It sends a very clear message to Russia that it has costs,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said.
EU member Ireland and Moldova on Tuesday joined the list of those countries expelling Russian diplomats over the Skripal poisoning.
The list includes 22 European countries including Britain itself which led the way by expelling 23 diplomats.
EXPULSIONS
In the toughest action that President Donald Trump has taken against Russia since coming to office, the United States has said it will expel 60 Russians, including 12 intelligence officers from Russia's mission to the U.N. headquarters in New York.
It is also closing the Russian consulate in Seattle.
Trump discussed Russia in separate phone calls on Tuesday with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The leaders endorsed the Western response to Russia's chemical weapons attack in Britain, including the expulsion of Russian diplomatic personnel, the White House said.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis hailed the diplomatic expulsions as a statement to those who doubted the unity of NATO.
""Russia has the potential to be a partner with Europe ... (but) I think right now we have to recognize that they have chosen to seek a different relationship with the NATO nations,"" he told reporters. 
In Prague, Paul Ryan, the Republican U.S. House Speaker, on Tuesday commended unity shown over the affair. ""It is important that we work in solidarity with each other, free people in democracies to stop Russia and condemn Russia for this kind of belligerent activity,"" Ryan said.
Russia has not disclosed yet what retaliatory steps it will take. President Vladimir Putin was on Tuesday in the Siberian city of Kemerovo at the scene of a shopping mall fire which claimed many lives. He made no comment on the Skripal affair.
Skripal's poisoning, which Britain says was caused by use of the Soviet-era military-grade nerve agent Novichok, is the first known offensive use of a nerve toxin in Europe since World War Two.
The attack on the 66-year-old Skripal and Yulia Skripal, his 33-year-old daughter, took place in the English cathedral city of Salisbury where he had been living since being swapped in a spy exchange deal in 2010.
They were found on March 4 unconscious on a public bench in the city and a British court says they may have suffered permanent brain damage in the attack. 

The Kremlin has accused Britain of whipping up an anti-Russia campaign and sought to cast doubt on the British analysis that Moscow was responsible.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Christians in the Gaza Strip have yet to receive any permits to go to Jerusalem to celebrate Easter, they said on Tuesday.
The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said church authorities had applied for around 600 permits for Gazans to travel, but had not received any, three days before Good Friday.
Israel tightly restricts movements out of the Gaza Strip, territory controlled by Hamas, an Islamist group that it considers a terrorist organization.
The Israeli military-run authority that operates in the West Bank defended its policy to restrict access as many Palestinians had stayed on illegally in the past, and said it would only issue permits to people aged at least 55.
""Israel is a sovereign state and it has the right to decide who will enter its gates. No foreign residents have an inherent right to enter Israel, including Palestinian residents of the Gaza Strip,"" a Civil Administration (COGAT) spokesman said, without saying whether permits would be issued this year.
Church leaders feared more restrictions than usual this year as Easter falls on the same weekend as the start of Passover, a Jewish holiday when Israel boosts security. 
Father Ibrahim Shomali, chancellor of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, said worshippers should not even be required to get permits.
""We have to have free access to the Holy Land, free access to our holy places,"" he said at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, revered as the site of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.
""Of course we apply, but in reality there must be no applying for permits to come to visit your own places.""
Gaza has only 1,000 Christians - most of them Greek Orthodox - among a population of 2 million in the narrow coastal strip. The Greek Orthodox authorities were not available to comment on Tuesday.
In Gaza, George Antone of the Latin Patriarchate said Israel allowed nearly 570 Christians in total out of Gaza last year, and hoped they would make it again this time.
""So far there has been no response. I will not lose hope but I will be sad if the permits do not come,"" he said.
Orthodox Christians celebrate Easter a week later, when Palestinians and pilgrims from around the world attend the ceremony of the Holy Fire.
Christian leaders said U.S. President Donald Trump's decision in December to recognize Jerusalem - sacred to Judaism, Christianity and Islam - as Israel's capital could embolden Israeli authorities' restrictions to their holy sites.
""(Israel) will close every single checkpoint, and this will be more strict than any other year because of the proclamation of Trump and the effects we got from it, and that we will get from it,"" Shomali said.
Youssef Daher, of the Jerusalem Inter-Church Centre, said Trump's decision could lead to further Israel pressure on Christian authorities, because ""they think that they have a free hand."" 

In February, Christian leaders took the rare decision to close the Church of the Holy Sepulchre for three days, in protest at a new Israeli tax policy and a proposed land expropriation law.

(Reuters) - Louisiana will not charge two white police officers who in 2016 fatally shot Alton Sterling, one of series of black men slain by police that sparked protests across the United States, because evidence showed their actions were justified, a state official said on Tuesday.
Sterling's death in Baton Rouge helped fuel the Black Lives Matter movement and inflamed a national debate over racial bias in U.S. policing.
Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry, a Republican, said Baton Rouge officers Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake had good reason to believe Sterling, 37, was armed with a gun and was resisting arrest.
""Our investigation has concluded that officers Lake and Salamoni attempted to make a lawful arrest of Alton Sterling based upon probable cause,"" Landry told a news conference.
Civil rights activists contend the officers escalated tensions during the arrest in a convenience store parking lot, turning it into a deadly encounter.
""He was murdered by two white racist police officers. He was murdered like an animal,"" Sterling's aunt, Veda Washington-Abusaleh, told reporters in video posted on social media by local media.
Landry told reporters the two Baton Rouge officers gave verbal instructions and tried non-lethal methods to subdue Sterling, who did not comply.
Sterling was shot outside the store on July 5, 2016, after a resident reported he had been threatened by a black man selling CDs. Police said Sterling was trying to pull a loaded gun out of his pocket when Salamoni opened fire.
""There was never any criminal activity here. It was an unfortunate situation but it was a justified shooting,"" John McLindon, an attorney for Salamoni, said in a telephone interview.
L. Chris Stewart, an Atlanta-based lawyer representing Sterlings’ relatives, said the family was disappointed by the decision. 
“This case did not even go to a grand jury, which would have allowed the citizens of Baton Rouge to decide this. It takes courage and we just didn’t see that in this situation,” he said in a telephone interview.
In June 2017, Sterling's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the city, alleging a history of excessive-force and racism toward African-Americans.
Democratic Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state prosecutors had followed the law in evaluating the case. He supported calls for the Baton Rouge Police Department to conduct a review to determine if disciplinary action should be taken.
""We owe this final review to the Baton Rouge community and the Sterling family,"" he said in a statement.
The two officers are on paid administrative leave, Salamoni's lawyer said.

The Sterling shooting prompted nationwide protests, including a demonstration two days later in Dallas where five law enforcement officers were fatally shot by an African-American ex-serviceman.

BELGRADE/PRISTINA (Reuters) - The party representing Kosovo's Serb minority withdrew from the government coalition on Tuesday in protest at what it called ""attacks on the people and representatives of Serbia"" by the authorities in the ethnic Albanian majority country. 
A day earlier, police fired tear gas at nationalist Serb protesters and briefly detained a Serbian official in the northern town of Mitrovica, which lies in a volatile, mainly minority Serb pocket of Kosovo.
The Serb minority party, Serb List, held three ministerial positions, including that of deputy prime minister. All four resigned on Tuesday, prompting Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj to ask them to reconsider.
European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said she was flying to Belgrade on Tuesday, having urged a day earlier for calm and for Belgrade and Pristina to continue their dialogue. 
""After yesterday's attack against people and representatives of Serbia, we cannot remain silent and we cannot be a decoration,"" Goran Rakic, leader of the Serb List party said. 
On Monday Kosovo police in Mitrovica used tear gas and stun grenades to disperse protesters outside a meeting on improving relations between Serbia and Kosovo, its former province that went to war against repressive Serbian rule in the late 1990s. 
Police also briefly detained Marko Djuric, the head of the Serbian government's office for Kosovo. Djuric is banned from entering Kosovo over nationalist remarks Pristina regarded as inflammatory. He was later released at the border and crossed back into Serbia. 
If Serb List's 10 deputies also walk out, Haradinaj's government would lose its parliamentary majority, though the PM ruled out snap elections.
""I hope the Serb list will reconsider (their decision) again because unilateral decisions to leave the government are not a solution,"" Haradinaj told reporters.
He denied the government was in danger of collapse but declined to say whether he would seek support from other parties. He also called on the Kosovo Serbs to return to dialogue. 
""It is not good to test anyone’s patience,"" he said.
Nearly half of 120,000 Kosovo Serbs live in the north of the country and maintain strong economic, cultural and political links with Belgrade. Albanians make up more than 90 percent of Kosovo's population of 1.8 million. 
Kosovo police said nationalist Serb protesters had blocked roads with trucks and other heavy vehicles in Mitrovica on Tuesday.
When he announced Serb List's withdrawal from the government, Rakic said Kosovo Serbs would go ahead, even without Pristina's consent, with forming a union of those municipalities where Serbs are in the majority, as agreed in an EU-sponsored dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina in 2013. 
The agreement, which was designed to give Kosovo Serbs greater autonomy, was never implemented. 
Kosovo won independence from Serbia after NATO bombed Serbian security forces to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians from the region in a counter-insurgency campaign.
Although recognized by 116 nations, Kosovo is not a United Nations member because of objections from Serbia, some EU states, Russia and China.
But Belgrade is under pressure to normalize relations with Kosovo in order to help it progress toward EU accession. Both parties have committed to an EU-sponsored dialogue but little progress has been made. 

Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday it condemned the incident in Mitrovica, saying it was ""aimed at intimidating Kosovan Serbs"".

The first direct condemnation by the influential state religious body of the pan-Arab TV channel ramps up Riyadh's 10-month-old feud with Doha as tensions with Iran mount.
""History will not forget that Qatar's Al Jazeera was and still is a platform for the propagandists of terrorism and its leaders,"" the body said in a statement carried by Saudi state news agency SPA.
""It is now ... spreading the speeches of the leader of Houthi terrorist militias in coordination with him in a clear targeting of the security of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"".
A spokesperson from Al Jazeera did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Saudi forces said they had shot down three missiles over Riyadh shortly before midnight. Air defenses also repelled missiles fired at the southern Saudi cities of Najran, Jizan and Khamis Mushait, the coalition said.
The Houthi group, which hails from a Shi'ite Muslim sect, is aligned to Sunni Saudi Arabia's regional rival Iran. Saudi military spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said on Monday that the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis reserved the right to respond to Iran ""at the appropriate time and manner"".
The standoff over the TV channel lies at the heart of a dispute that led Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain to cut travel and trade ties with Qatar in June, accusing it of backing Islamists and their arch-foe Iran.
They say Qatar uses the channel as a mouthpiece to attack them and back Islamist groups across the Arab world and has demanded it be closed down, while Doha insists it is independent and offers uncensored debate absent on other Arab networks.
On Monday, Qatar condemned the attacks on Saudi cities as ""a violation of international law"".

BEIRUT (Reuters) - One is the grandson of an Armenian troubadour who fled to Syria in 1915. The other is a descendant of a Syrian army chief who died fighting the French in 1920. One hails from Aleppo, the other from Damascus. Both Syrian artists call New York, where they met 17 years ago, home.
For one night on stage in Beirut on Monday, Kevork Mourad's live sketches combined with Kinan Azmeh's clarinet to create a whirlwind of images to mirror the seven years of war that have made their country unrecognizable. 
Syria's conflict began in 2011 with a popular uprising and has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced 11 million more. A generation of young children has grown up without proper education, with 180,000 youths forced into child labor, the U.N. children's fund UNICEF says. 
Azmeh, 41, says the numbers are enough to make him think Syrians may never recover but it is important to keep working. 
""The art I do doesn't stop a bullet, doesn't bring a free democratic secular Syria, it doesn’t bring back people who died ... (but) it gives us a reason to live,"" he said.
Azmeh and Mourad launched their project six years ago under the title ""Home Within"" and the show has evolved with the war.
They describe their performance as a sort of dialogue. ""Kinan gives me a line and I gave him a picture,"" Mourad said.
In one sketch on screen, with the shadow of Azmeh playing, Mourad's silhouettes rise from darkness to reveal a group huddled in a small boat. Mourad says the image symbolizes Syrian refugees who have crossed to Europe and the flight of his ancestors from Armenia.
""When I draw, it becomes a single story, it becomes about a family, a boat and people are in it. And then when I zoom out, it is about ... an entire country,"" Mourad said.
Many Syrian artists, both those who left and those who stayed, seek to document their nation's suffering and say their art is a necessity rather than a luxury.

""We are going through the darkest of times,"" said Azmeh, a graduate of New York's Julliard music school and a member of acclaimed cellist Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road ensemble. ""The question is what do you do?""

Machar, who has been held in South Africa since late 2016, should ""be allowed to relocate to any country outside the region and not neighboring South Sudan"", read a statement issued after a meeting on Monday of officials from the eight countries in the bloc.
IGAD said it had designated officials to decide on a third country. It was unclear why a third country that does not border South Sudan would be preferable to South Africa. 
There was no immediate comment from South Africa's foreign ministry. 
South Sudan government spokesman Michael Makuei Lueth said Juba had no problem with the bloc's decision, but that Machar should not be allowed to take part in peace talks in Addis Ababa. 
A spokesman for Machar's SPLM-IO rebel group said it was reviewing IGAD's statement and would respond later. 
Civil war broke out in oil-rich South Sudan in 2013, when troops loyal to President Salva Kiir clashed with forces loyal to Machar, then the vice president.
Tens of thousands have been killed since. Oil production has been slashed. About a third of the population of 12 million have been forced from their homes.
The warring parties signed a ceasefire in December in the Ethiopian capital, but it was violated within hours. A new round of talks is scheduled for late next month. 
The bloc also announced that it wanted to impose targeted sanctions on individuals violating the latest peace deal or otherwise disrupting it, but referred the matter to the African Union.
Last month, the head of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, said it was open to imposing sanctions on leaders violating the ceasefire in South Sudan.
His comments followed a chorus of other calls for action against those stoking the conflict. 

The United States imposed a unilateral arms embargo last month but has been unable to convince the 15-member U.N. Security Council to impose one.

Abdel Rahman, 59, was head of the Al Dawa Islamic center in the southern city of Foggia. Police said in a statement they believed he used the position to promote ""terrorist activities"" and spread jihadist propaganda.
Rahman had been placed under surveillance for months and his classes with local children were wiretapped.
""I invite you to fight the unbelievers, with your swords cut off their heads, with your explosive belts blow up their bodies,"" he was recorded telling one group of children, who were aged between 4-10, police said.
""It is necessary to break the skulls of the unbelievers and drink their blood to get the victory,"" he was recorded saying.
As part of their investigation, which was code-named ""bad teacher"", police said they had seized some 370,000 euros ($458,000) in financial assets. 
Rahman is married to an Italian woman and has obtained Italian nationality. It was not immediately possible to get a comment from him.

Nearly 700,000 Muslim Rohingya fled to Bangladesh since the military launched a crackdown in Myanmar's western Rakhine state in response to insurgent attacks on security forces in August, according to U.N. estimates. The United States and U.N. have described the operation as ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya, which Myanmar denies.
Senior General Min Aung Hlaing said in a speech to military personnel and their families last week in northern Kachin State that Rohingya ""do not have any characteristics or culture in common with the ethnicities of Myanmar"", according to his website.
The military chief also said the tensions in Rakhine were ""fueled because the Bengalis demanded citizenship"", using a term that Rohingya activists reject as implying they are illegal migrants from Bangladesh.
U.N. chief Guterres said in a statement on Monday he was ""shocked"" at the comments, and urged ""all leaders in Myanmar to take a unified stance against incitement to hatred and to promote communal harmony"".
""The Secretary-General reiterates the importance of addressing the root causes of the violence and the responsibility of the Government of Myanmar to provide security and assistance to those in need,"" the statement said. 
Though many Rohingya say their families have lived in Myanmar for generations, they are not among the 135 officially recognized ethnic groups and so are denied citizenship.
Several calls to a military spokesman seeking comment went unanswered.

The army chief is an influential figure under Myanmar's constitution, which obliges Aung San Suu Kyi's civilian government to share power with the military.

ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algerian doctors are expanding a pay strike and teachers are resuming one, representatives said on Tuesday, putting pressure on President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and his prime minister at a time when resources are limited. 
Medical students and specialist doctors in several hospitals on Tuesday joined a strike by family doctors that has already been weakening health care in Algiers and other major cities for the last four months.
Protests over economic grievances are frequent in the OPEC member, but this year's walkout is the largest since riots in 2011 that followed uprisings in Egypt, Tunisia and elsewhere in the region.
The protests come at a time of political uncertainty — Bouteflika, 81, has barely appeared in public since suffering a stroke in 2013.
""Our colleagues the students and our colleagues the specialists have decided to show support by joining the strike,"" Mohamed Toualeb, a spokesman for the strikers, told Reuters, without giving numbers.
""The government is unable to address our demands,"" he said. ""So we are calling on Bouteflika to find a solution to our problems.""
Teachers plan to launch new a strike on April 9, a labor union said, in disappointment that government promises after an earlier protest had not led to any concrete action. 
""We will go for a strike of two days per week,"" the teacher's union said a statement.""
Several weeks ago Bouteflika, in office since 1999, defused a three-month teachers' strike that had shut down hundreds of schools by promising to find a solution.
In 2011, the government took the sting out of protests by raising social spending - but this time, money is much shorter as energy revenues, which make up 60 percent of state income, have halved since 2014 due to low prices.
A well-known religious leader asked by the government to mediate has had no success.
Bouteflika could intervene again, but this would make look Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia weak, raising the likelihood of a cabinet reshuffle, observers say.
""Ongoing strikes are evidence that the government has not found the formula to defuse social timebombs,"" said political analyst Farid Ferrari (NYSE:RACE). 
A list of potential new ministers has already been circulated on social media and a private TV channel, but officials were not available to comment on it.

LONDON (Reuters) - Julian Assange was called a ""miserable little worm"" on Tuesday by a British foreign affairs minister who said the WikiLeaks founder should leave the Ecuadorean embassy in London and give himself up to British justice.
Assange has been living inside the embassy since June 2012, when he entered the building to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning about allegations of sex crimes, which he has always denied.
The Swedish investigation was dropped in May last year, but Assange, who was on bail at the time when he walked into the embassy, faces arrest by the British authorities for breaching his bail terms should he step outside.
""It’s of great regret that Julian Assange remains in the Ecuador embassy,"" junior minister Alan Duncan said during a question-and-answer session on foreign affairs in parliament's House of Commons, in response to a question about Assange.
""It’s about time that this miserable little worm walked out of the embassy and gave himself up to British justice.""
Assange responded to Duncan's comment with a tweet.
""As a political prisoner detained without charge for 8 years, in violation of 2 UN rulings, I suppose I must be 'miserable'; yet nothing wrong with being a 'little' person although I'm rather tall; and better a 'worm', a healthy creature that invigorates the soil, than a snake,"" he said.
Assange says the real reason for his legal troubles is the fact that WikiLeaks published U.S. diplomatic and military secrets, and fears that if he leaves the embassy he risks being extradited to the United States.
He considers himself to be under arbitrary detention in the Ecuadorean embassy - a description of his situation rejected by the British authorities who say he voluntarily went into the building and could leave anytime if he were prepared to face up to the consequences of his actions.
""I have already fully served any theoretical (I haven't been charged) 'bail violation' whilst in prison and under house arrest. So why is there a warrant for my arrest?"" he said in an email to Reuters.
Last month, a British judge refused to halt legal proceedings against Assange for jumping bail and said he was ""a man who wants to impose his terms on the course of justice"".

British police ended their permanent guard on the embassy in October 2015 but said they would maintain ""covert tactics"" to arrest Assange if he left. At the time, they said 12.6 million pounds ($17.8 million) had been spent on guarding the embassy.

The increase follows recent warnings from police about a new and significant threat from organized far-right terrorism, with four such plots foiled in the previous 12 months.
People are referred to Prevent, a key strand of Britain's security strategy, if concerns are raised with police or local authorities that they are being drawn into terrorism. 
Since 2015, public bodies such as schools, health workers and universities are compelled to report any suspicions they might have.
Figures showed 968 people, including 272 aged under 15, were referred to the program because of right-wing concerns in the year to March 2017, an increase of 28 percent from the year before.
Overall, the number of Prevent referrals was down from 7,631 to 6,093. The majority, 3,704 or 61 percent, were made because of fears over Islamist extremism, although this number was down by 26 percent from the previous year.
Of those referred to the program, 332 were finally passed on to the voluntary, de-radicalization scheme known as Channel to receive support from specialist mentors, with more than a third referred over far-right extremism. 
Prevent has been dogged since its inception by claims that it is used to spy on Muslim communities but ministers and police say it aims to tackle all forms of extremism and has helped to stop radicalization.
Most of those referred to Prevent were aged under 20, with more than a quarter under 15.
Britain suffered five attacks last year which were classified as terrorism by the authorities, four of which were blamed on Islamist militants and one on a far-right extremist. The country remains on the second-highest threat level of ""severe"", meaning an attack is considered highly likely.

Opponents of Nkurunziza's third term launched an armed struggle against his government, and the resulting violence has killed hundreds of people and forced at least 400,000 into exile. Some of those who fled were opposition politicians who said they feared for their lives.
Baricako's party RANAC was a coalition of three political parties during the 2015 elections and registered as a single party in December 2016.

The emperor, who has spent much of his nearly three decades on the throne seeking to soothe the wounds of war, will step down on April 30 next year in the first abdication by a Japanese emperor in nearly two centuries.
The three-day visit to the southwestern chain of islands is the 11th by the imperial couple and their first since 2014, when they came ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Okinawa.
More than two months of fighting between U.S. and Japanese troops in 1945 killed about a third of the island's people.
""He really thinks deeply about Okinawa, that's why he can come so often,"" Naeko Teruya, 84, a survivor of the battle, told NHK public television. Five members of Teruya's family were killed in the fighting, including her father.
Akihito and Empress Michiko laid flowers at a memorial in Itoman city, where one of the fiercest final battles took place, bowing deeply. On Wednesday, they will visit the island of Yonaguni, the westernmost point of Japan.
Okinawa residents lived under U.S. rule for 27 years after the war. Today, it hosts nearly 75 percent of the U.S. military presence in Japan, a devil's bargain that has brought jobs but has also worry about crime and military accidents.
The imperial couple first visited Okinawa in 1975, when painful memories of the war - fought in the name of Akihito's father - were sharper and attitudes toward the imperial family complicated. He became the first Japanese monarch to visit in 1993 after assuming the throne in 1989.

Akihito, 84, said in 2016 he feared age might make it hard for him to fulfill his duties. He will be succeeded by his heir, 58-year-old Crown Prince Naruhito.

The conditions in the government-backed proposal are tougher than other ideas floated - especially those of the anti-European Union, far-right SPD party - as Babis's ANO party has sought to prevent any EU referendum in the largely euroskeptic nation.
After losing a confidence vote in January, Babis has been scrambling to gain support for his continued rule. His caretaker cabinet backed on Tuesday a proposal from potential coalition partners the Social Democrats.
Under the law, at least 850,000 signatures would be needed to call any national referendum and for any measure to gain approval it would need support of more than a half of eligible voters in the country, Babis said on Twitter. 
The bill will now head to parliament.
The SPD party made surprising gains in parliamentary elections last October with calls for direct democracy and is pushing its own referendum legislation. 
SPD had previously been in talks with Babis's ANO party about possible government support. 
The potential alliance raised some fears Czechs' wide euroskepticism could be put to the test in a referendum on EU membership following Britain's shock Brexit vote to leave the union.
ANO and previous governments in Prague have been largely cool to deeper EU integration and the bloc's migration policies, although membership has never come into question in the country of 10.6 million.
Babis's party, the runaway election winner last year but lacking a parliamentary majority, is in exclusive talks with the Social Democrats over a government.
Babis, a billionaire businessman before entering government after 2013 elections, aims to have a new administration in place by mid-year but still faces tough talks. 

Most parties are demanding Babis stay out of the cabinet while facing police allegations that he illegally obtained a 2 million euro subsidy meant for small businesses a decade ago. Babis has denied wrongdoing.

BEIJING (Reuters) - With Beijing under heavy security as a mystery North Korean delegation visited the Chinese capital, internet users scrambled to stay a step ahead of censors on Tuesday as China's tightly controlled state media remained silent. 
Videos circulated on popular messaging app WeChat on Monday evening of a motorcade traveling around Beijing including clips of cars entering Beijing's Diaoyutai State Guest House. 
One car, a stretch Mercedes limousine, was believed to be transporting a senior North Korean official, possibly leader Kim Jong Un, who had never been known to make a journey abroad since assuming power after his father died in 2011. 
On Tuesday, Chinese internet users kept each other abreast, speculating about the enigmatic guests' visits to Beijing sites including Zhongguancun, one of China's technology hubs, before the entourage is believed to have boarded the train they had arrived on a day earlier. 
WeChat public accounts focusing on news about North Korea had been censored by Chinese authorities, with no articles about a senior North Korean visitor on many prominent accounts that cover China-North Korea ties.
""They have been deleting North Korea-related articles for the past few days. It's been very hard for us to post on our public account,"" one Chinese person who edits an online account about North Korea told Reuters.
The people Reuters spoke to for this story declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's Internet regulator, did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment late on Tuesday.
China's propaganda ministry released a notice on Monday banning state media from reporting news related to North Korea, one journalist who works for a Chinese state-run media outlet told Reuters. An editor at another state media outlet said they were directed by superiors not to cover discussions of the visit by a North Korean.
China's propaganda ministry did not immediately respond when contacted for comment. 
A search using the term ""North Korea"" was blocked on Tuesday on Weibo, a popular microblogging platform in China, yielding no results.
Internet users tried to get around the censors by resorting to nicknames for the visitor including ""the obese patient"" and ""the fatty on the train"" as well as more ambiguous terms like ""the visitor from the northeast"" and ""the sibling next door"". 
Speculation remains rife about whether Kim or his sister Kim Yo Jong or North Korea's ceremonial leader Kim Yong Nam was visiting Beijing. China-based North Korea-watchers scoured for clues to pin down the identity of the visitor. 

""Security is not so thorough as when the late Mr. Kim visited,"" one source told Reuters, referring to Kim Jong Il's last visit to China in 2011. During that visit, police were posted every 50-100 meters along the railway line, a contrast to this time around, the source said.

U.S. President Donald Trump in December broke with other world powers by recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital and announcing the U.S. Embassy would be moved there from Tel Aviv. 
Trump's reversal of decades of U.S. and broad international policy was welcomed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a ""historic decision"". But it drew criticism from around the world and outraged Palestinians, who want a capital for their own future state in eastern parts of the city. 
Israel has said the Embassy will be opened on May 14, the 70th anniversary of its founding. A U.S. official said it would be located at a provisional site in Jerusalem that now houses a U.S. consular section.
Building a permanent embassy could take several years.
Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon said in a statement that he would empower the Jerusalem municipality to waive the permits that would have been required for a wall and an escape route at the interim site.
""We will not allow needless bureaucracy to hold up the transfer of the American embassy to Jerusalem, Israel's eternal capital,"" Kahlon said.
""This is a strategic diplomatic move for the State of Israel and the planning agencies under me will do whatever is necessary to accommodate the schedule being demanded.""
Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat had voiced concern about the timeline, telling Israel Radio on March 9: ""I hope their (Americans') schedule will be kept.""
The Israeli planning permit waiver for the Embassy will be good for three years, the Finance Ministry statement said.
""Initially, the interim Embassy in (the Jerusalem neighbourhood of) Arnona will contain office space for the Ambassador and a small staff,"" said a U.S. Embassy official in Tel Aviv.
""By the end of next year, we intend to open a new Embassy Jerusalem annex on the Arnona compound that will provide the Ambassador and his team with expanded interim office space,"" he said, adding that a search for site for the construction of a permanent embassy had begun.
Most countries do not recognise either side's sovereignty in Jerusalem and have embassies to Israel in the Tel Aviv area.
Netanyahu has described Jerusalem as ""the capital of the Jewish people for 3,000 years"", and Trump said the embassy move was ""a long overdue step to advance the peace process"".

Palestinian leaders said Washington's decision meant it was no longer an honest broker in efforts to revive peace talks, which collapsed in 2014.

KOLKATA (Reuters) - Clashes in India between supporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party and those of an opposition party snowballed into Hindu-Muslim rioting, with three people killed and dozens injured over two days of violence, police said on Tuesday.
The trouble in the eastern state of West Bengal began on Sunday with rival processions by Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the state's ruling Trinamool Congress marking the birth of the Hindu god Rama.
Violence broke out on Sunday and spilled over into Monday, turning into clashes between Hindus and Muslims.
Anuj Sharma, a top police official in the state, said officials had held an emergency meeting on Tuesday and security had been increased, with riot police deployed, and about 100 people detained to snuff out the violence.
""Large scale arrests are underway,"" Sharma told Reuters.
The danger of communal violence is a constant worry in the world's biggest democracy. 
Tension between Muslims and Hindus has increased in some places since Modi and his Hindu-nationalist BJP came to power in 2014.
Babul Supriyo, a BJP federal government minister from West Bengal, blamed Muslims for the violence.
""Goons from the minority community"" had torched shops and ""pulled Hindus out from their houses and assaulted/injured them brutally with choppers & swords"", he said on Twitter.
Police declined to comment on Supriyo's assertion while a Trinamool Congress leader denounced it as ""highly regrettable"".
Muslim community leaders were not available for comment.
State BJP chief Dilip Ghosh said at least half a dozen senior BJP members had been named in police complaints for causing disharmony between communities and illegally carrying weapons, but the party denied wrongdoing.
West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who heads the Trinamool Congress and is one of Modi's biggest critics, ordered strict police action against all trouble-makers.
Modi's party has been trying hard to gain ground in West Bengal, one of the few states it has never ruled. 
The party is in power in 21 of India's 29 states, propelled by Modi's popularity as well as by religious polarization in some places.

Mireille Knoll, 85, was found dead on Friday at her apartment in Paris's central 11th district. She had been stabbed multiple times and her flat set alight.
President Emmanuel Macron responded to her death by saying that he was determined to stamp out anti-Semitism in France, home to western Europe's largest Jewish community.
The suspects were interrogated by police before being sent before a judge, who initiated a formal investigation into murder motivated by the real or supposed adherence to a religion, as well as aggravated theft and damage to property, the source said. 
Under French law, being placed under formal investigation often - but not always - leads to people being sent to trial. 
As a child in Paris, Knoll evaded the round-up of Jews during World War Two, Paris lawmaker Meyer Habib said. Thousands of Jews were taken to the Velodrome d'Hiver cycling track in 1942 and sent on to Nazi death camps.
France's 400,000-strong community has complained for years of a rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes.
In 2015, vandals desecrated 250 tombstones in a Jewish cemetery in eastern France only days after four Jews were killed in an attack on a kosher grocery in Paris.
Knoll's killing took place a year to the day after the murder of Sarah Halimi-Attal, a 65-year-old whose killing prosecutors believe was anti-Semitic.
France's chief rabbi on Monday described Knoll's death as a ""horror"" and Jewish leaders called for a march in her memory.
In a twitter message late on Monday night, Macron said: ""I want to express my emotion after the horrific crime committed against Mme Knoll. I reaffirm my total determination in fighting anti-Semitism.""

Last week, Poland's government, run by the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party, told Brussels it was willing to make some changes to the reforms that the European Commissions had said subverted the rule of law.
""The price is significant, it's bitter,"" Kaczynski told the conservative news site wPolityce.pl. ""I'm not going to hide that we model ourselves on the (Hungarian) Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has often had to make unpleasant concessions.""
Kaczynski added that he would have preferred to go ahead with the reforms, but internal and external ""circumstances"" have forced the changes. 
Under the changes, the justice minister now would have seek the opinion of judges before deciding whether to dismiss a court president. PiS was also willing to equalize the compulsory retirement age of female and male judges at 65 years.
Under the original judicial overhaul, the justice minister was granted discretionary powers to replace court presidents without seeking any secondary opinion, without providing any justification and with no review.
The initial judicial overhaul also set the compulsory retirement age at 60 years for female judges and 65 for male judges, meaning almost 40 percent of Supreme Court judges would be forced into retirement.

HANOI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Dozens of Chinese naval vessels are exercising this week with an aircraft carrier in a large show of force off Hainan island in the South China Sea, satellite images obtained by Reuters show.
The images, provided by Planet Labs Inc, confirm a Chinese carrier group has entered the vital trade waterway as part of what the Chinese navy earlier described as combat drills that were part of routine annual exercises.
The Liaoning carrier group last week traversed the Taiwan Strait, according to the Taiwanese defense ministry. 
The photos, taken on Monday, show what appear to be at least 40 ships and submarines flanking the carrier Liaoning in what some analysts described as an unusually large display of the Chinese military's growing naval might.
Sailing in a line formation more suited to visual propaganda than hard military maneuvers, the flotilla was headed by what appeared to be submarines, with aircraft above.
Jeffrey Lewis, a security expert at the California-based based Middlebury Institute of Strategic Studies, said the images showed the first confirmation that the carrier was joining the drills.
""It's an incredible picture,"" he said. ""That’s the big news to me. Confirmation that, yes, the carrier participated in the exercise.""
While the Liaoning has previously entered the South China Sea as part of drills in uncontested training grounds south of Hainan, its annual exercises are closely watched by regional and international powers eyeing Beijing's growing military might.
It is unclear where the flotilla was headed, or how long operations will last. China's defense ministry did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.
Collin Koh, a security expert at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, described the deployment as unusual for its size and scope.
""Judging by the images, it does seem they are keen to show that elements of the South Sea Fleet are able to routinely join up with the carrier strike group from Dalian in the north,"" he said.
""It does seem they want to show inter-fleet interoperability - something the (Chinese) navy has been quietly working on for some time.""
Chinese naval and coast guard forces have expanded rapidly in recent years and now patrol the vast swathes of the South China Sea, but little is known about their combat readiness and co-ordination.
Koh said as well as the destroyers, frigates and submarines that would ordinarily support a carrier, the flotilla appeared to include a large oiler for re-supply as well as smaller corvettes and possibly fast attack catamarans.
""While it highlights an extensive ability to deploy, we are still left to guess at the PLAN's combat readiness,"" Koh said.
As well as Vietnam, China's claims in the South China Sea are disputed by the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei while Taiwan also has claims. 
The exercises come amid fresh signs of tension in the resource-rich waterway, with Vietnam recently halting oil exploration off its coast by Spanish firm Repsol (MC:REP) under pressure from Beijing.

Beijing also objected to a so-called freedom of navigation patrol by a U.S. warship last week close to one of its artificial islands in the Spratlys archipelago further south.

LONDON (Reuters) - The case of a former Catalan separatist politician who is fighting extradition to Spain from Scotland on charges of rebellion may stir political complications at an awkward time for Edinburgh's pro-independence government.
Clara Ponsati, a professor at the University of St. Andrews and a former Catalan education minister, is one of a number of former separatist leaders who face charges of rebellion because of a Catalan vote on independence last October, banned under Spain's constitution. 
She will fight the extradition on the grounds that she is unlikely to get a fair trial, her lawyer Aamar Anwar said on Monday, one day after German police detained former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont on an international arrest warrant instigated by Spain.
Puigdemont had been living in self-imposed exile in Belgium, having fled there after Madrid dismissed his regional government following a unilateral declaration of independence in October.
Throwing its weight behind Ponsati, the University of St Andrews on Tuesday said it was deeply concerned about her extradition, saying it believed she was being targeted for her political beliefs. 
The pro-independence Scottish government said it supports Catalans' right to self-determination. 
But Ponsati's case, to be heard initially in Edinburgh, may now become more legally complex pitting Scotland, part of the United Kingdom, against Spain at a tricky time for the Scottish nationalist movement. 
With Britain's exit from the European Union in the offing, polls show Scots have little appetite for another independence vote although root support for secession is still around 45 percent, polls show, and many are disgruntled.
Another bugbear is that Scots voted against Brexit, but as part of the United Kingdom, Scotland will nevertheless leave the EU. 
Separately, the Scottish National Party, which runs the devolved government with wide-reaching powers over health, education and taxes, has requested a meeting with the Spanish ambassador in London to express its opposition to the treatment of Spanish politicians.
Scottish nationalists are in a delicate position; the SNP supports both independence from the United Kingdom and EU membership, and it does not want to provoke the ire of EU member Spain. 
Madrid took a hardline against Scottish independence in a 2014 referendum campaign, wary of an example being set for Catalonia's secessionist camp. 
But nor do Scottish nationalists want to be seen to fall short in supporting a fellow nationalist movement.
""Many SNP supporters and leaders are sensitive and sympathetic to the Catalan cause,"" said Dani Cetra, a research fellow at Edinburgh's Centre on Constitutional Change.
""In the context of Brexit, this has led the Scottish government to tone down its pro-European discourse, since many SNP voters are frustrated at the European silence about the jailing of Catalan leaders,"" he said.
The SNP parliamentary leader, Ian Blackford, on Monday requested a meeting with the Spanish ambassador to London. 
""We believe that the political dispute over the future direction of Catalonia is one that must be handled democratically,"" Blackford wrote to Carlos Bastarreche. 
""I have very real concerns that the current pre-trial imprisonment and pursuit of recently elected politicians, preventing them from participating in the formation of a new government goes against the principle of, democracy, of respect for human rights and risks people’s basic civil liberties."" 
The Catalan regional administration has been under direct rule from Madrid and news of Puigdemont's arrest sparked demonstrations in Barcelona which ended in violent clashes with police this weekend. A number of other Catalan politicians have been jailed pending trial on rebellion charges.
""We believe there are legitimate arguments that Clara is being targeted for standing up for her political beliefs."" St. Andrews said of Ponseti in a statement.
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Monday her government would co-operate with Madrid over the extradition request as it was legally obliged to. But she added that 

it nevertheless supported people of Catalonia's right to determine their own future.

410,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 05:25AM ET</span>","Japan Foreign Minister Kono: U.S., Japan 'completely in sync' on North Korea","By Linda Sieg
TOKYO (Reuters) - The United States and Japan are ""completely in sync"" over North Korea and agree that it must abolish its medium- and short-range missiles as well as intercontinental and intermediate range ballistic missiles, Japan's foreign minister said on Tuesday.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is set to see U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington next month before a proposed summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on the crisis over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs. 
That U.S.-North Korea summit would follow a North-South summit in April.
Trump's decision to meet Kim has sparked concerns in Japan that the U.S. leader could do a deal that would protect America's homeland but leave Japan vulnerable, while a rapid turnover in key White House personnel has meant Japanese officials are having to deal with a changing line-up. 
""I think the U.S. and Japan are in sync for this North Korea issue. It is important for the international community as a whole to keep maximum pressure on North Korea until North Korea takes concrete steps toward complete irreversible and verifiable denuclearization,"" Foreign Minister Taro Kono told Reuters in an interview.
Kono, who recently met U.S. officials in Washington, also said Washington agreed with Tokyo that North Korea must abandon its medium- and short-range missiles as well as ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles) capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.
""They are in full agreement,"" Kono said, speaking fluent English.
""There are tens of thousands of American soldiers and their families living within their range, so I think they are also concerned with medium- to short-range missiles,"" he said, referring to U.S. troops stationed in South Korea and Japan.
STEEL TARIFFS COULD HURT U.S. AUTO MAKERS
The U.S.-educated Kono, 55, left the door open to the possibility that Abe might himself meet the North's Kim at some point. Speaking after reports that Kim was visiting Beijing on Tuesday, Kono said Japan was closely watching preparations for the North-South Korean summit and the Trump-Kim meeting.
Kono, referring to the reports Kim might be in Beijing, quipped: ""So we never know if someone would come to Tokyo.""
Kono also said Trump's decision not to exempt Japanese steel products from 25 percent tariffs could hurt the U.S. auto industry because U.S. auto makers would keep buying the high-quality Japanese products they need.
He urged Washington not to violate World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules and expressed hope the United States would return to a multi-nation Asia-Pacific trade pact negotiated by Trump's predecessor but shunned by Trump.
Experts have said Trump may want to use the tariffs to pressure Japan into starting talks on a two-way free trade agreement (FTA).
But Kono said bilateral economic matters would continue to be handled in an ""economic dialogue"" led by Vice President Mike Pence and Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso.
Japan has been opposed to bilateral FTA talks because it would likely increase pressure to open up politically sensitive markets such as agriculture.
""There is Japan-U.S. economic dialogue between Vice President Pence and Deputy Prime Minister Aso, so the economic issue will be handled in that dialogue,"" Kono said.
""We are looking forward to have Americans come back to TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership),"" he said. Japan and 10 other countries signed a ""TPP-11"" version of that agreement this month.
Kono, sometimes floated as a potential candidate to succeed Abe as premier, declined to say whether he might challenge Abe in a September ruling Liberal Democratic Party leadership vote.
Abe's support ratings have slid over a suspected cronyism scandal and possible cover-up regarding a discounted sale of state-owned land to a school operator with ties to his wife. Abe has denied any wrongdoing by himself or his wife.

""Whenever I think it's appropriate, I will make a move,"" he said.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Six former Israeli spymasters accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday of jeopardizing the country's future as it prepares to celebrate the 70th anniversary of its founding next month.
The surviving ex-Mossad intelligence agency chiefs voiced their opinion of the fourth-term, right-wing leader in a joint interview excerpted on the front page of Yedioth Ahronoth, Israel's best-selling newspaper and a regular Netanyahu critic.
Netanyahu had no immediate response, but a senior member of his governing coalition brushed off the censure.
Danny Yatom, who headed the Mossad during Netanyahu's first stint in office in the late 1990s, called for his ouster, accusing him and his aides of ""putting their interests ahead of national interests"" as corruption investigations deepen.
Police questioned Netanyahu on Monday over his alleged dealings with the country's largest telecommunication company, one of three cases weighing on his political future. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and opinion polls show his popularity is still high.
Yatom also voiced concern about ""the inertia in the diplomatic sphere, which is leading us toward a bi-national state (with the Palestinians), which would spell the end of (Israel as) a Jewish and democratic state"".
Negotiations over a ""two-state solution"" to Israel's conflict with the Palestinians have been frozen since 2014. Some argue that if Israel fails to quit occupied territory, it could one day face a choice between remaining a democracy or securing a Jewish majority by denying the Palestinians voting rights.
Figures cited by Israeli officials on Monday showed the number of Jews and Arabs between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River - territory encompassing Israel, the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip - is at or near parity.
""We have children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren here, and I want them to live in a healthy country - and the country is sick,"" Zvi Zamir, Mossad director from 1968 to 1974, was quoted as saying by Yedioth. 
""We are in a critical medical state. It could be that the country had symptoms when Netanyahu took over, but he has brought it to the grave condition of a malignant disease."" 
Netanyahu's office did not immediately respond. 
Education Minister Naftali Bennett, a hardliner in Israel's conservative coalition government, took to Twitter to dismiss the allegations aired by the ex-spymasters as ""simply untrue"".
""The country is in an excellent condition,"" said Bennett, who has cast himself as a possible successor to Netanyahu . 

""Among most of our leadership, the good of the country is first and foremost .... Israel is going in a good direction!""

The former Soviet republic is seeking to raise its international profile as part of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev's campaign to open up the nation of 32 million and attract foreign investment after decades of isolation and economic stagnation.
""...We stand ready to create all necessary conditions, at any stage of the peace process, to arrange on the territory of Uzbekistan direct talks between the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban movement,"" Mirziyoyev told a conference in Tashkent attended by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.
European Union foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini and a number of foreign minister including those of Russia, China and Turkey, also attended the Tashkent conference, but there were no Taliban representatives.
Mirziyoyev took over the predominantly Muslim Uzbekistan after the death in 2016 of authoritarian President Islam Karimov, who had run the country since the Soviet era.
Tashkent's ties with the West were strained under Karimov who was often criticized over his government's human rights abuses.

Mirziyoyev has promised to liberalize the country and has launched a diplomatic campaign to bring in foreign investment and boost trade.

BEIRUT/AMMAN (Reuters) - Thousands of people left eastern Ghouta for Syrian rebel territory near the Turkish border on Tuesday, the third large group to leave under a deal brokered by Russia to surrender the enclave near Damascus to the Syrian government.
Government forces were also mobilizing around Douma, the last rebel-held town in eastern Ghouta, a war monitor reported, piling pressure on the insurgents holed up inside to cut a similar deal.
The Jaish al-Islam group, which has so far refused to leave Ghouta, said Russia had yet to give an answer to proposals that involve its fighters and civilians staying in Douma, adding that a meeting was expected on Wednesday.
Rebels have been leaving other parts of Ghouta in batches with their families, accepting safe passage to the Idlib region in the northwest after they were beaten into retreat in a fierce assault by the Russia-backed Syrian army.
It marks the biggest defeat for the rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad since insurgents were driven from eastern Aleppo in 2016, underscoring his unassailable military position after seven years of conflict.
Some 7,000 people - most of them fighters and their families - left on 100 buses in the early hours of the morning, the monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said. More buses drove into eastern Ghouta ahead of a further evacuation.
""We faced two choices: go to Idlib or make peace with the regime,"" said Sakhr Yousef, a 24-year-old fighter with the Failaq al-Rahman faction, as he was preparing to leave eastern Ghouta with his wife and four young siblings. 
""Making peace with the regime is very difficult, making peace with those who bombed us with criminal Russia,"" he added in a voice message to Reuters, referring to Assad's main backer in the conflict. 
The Syrian military split eastern Ghouta into three separate zones during its assault that began on Feb. 18 and has killed more than 1,600 people, according to the Observatory.
The rebels being evacuated on Tuesday are leaving from a pocket encompassing the towns of Arbin, Ain Tarma and Zamalka that was controlled by Failaq al-Rahman rebels.
The last remaining insurgent-held area in Ghouta is the town of Douma. The Islamist group that controls it, Jaish al-Islam, is in talks with Russia that have yet to yield a result.
""We have presented our decision to stay. This is not only a decision by Jaish al-Islam, but by all the revolutionary institutions and figures in Douma,"" said Hamza Birqdar, the group's military spokesman.
The United Nations said it is concerned for 70,000-78,000 people it said were trapped in Douma and is ready to provide aid if the government lets it in.
""The United Nations and its partners are ready to proceed to Douma with food for up to 16,500 people, as well as health, nutrition and water, sanitation and hygiene supplies. But facilitation letters have to be signed by the Government of Syria,"" Mark Lowcock, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, said in a statement.
DISPLACED PEOPLE SUBJECTED TO ""SCREENING PROCESS""
Backed by Russia and Iran, the government has repeatedly forced rebels to surrender areas and withdraw to Idlib, where the UN now describes situation as ""catastrophic"". The opposition has called this a policy of ""demographic change"" aimed at forcing dissidents out of Syria's main cities.
State television, broadcasting from the outskirts of Arbin, showed buses moving along a dusty road through a wasteland of heavily damaged buildings.
A correspondent with Hezbollah's al-Manar TV said it could take four to five days to evacuate the tens of thousands of people who had agreed to leave Arbin, Ain Tarma and Zamalka.
Hezbollah, a heavily armed Lebanese group backed by Iran, has fought on Assad's side during the war.
The Russian news agency TASS said 13,190 rebels had left eastern Ghouta in the last three days.
Tens of thousands of people have also fled eastern Ghouta this month into areas controlled by the Syrian government.
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said more than 80,000 people had left formerly besieged parts of eastern Ghouta as control shifted since March 9. 
The displaced ""have to proceed to collective shelters and are not permitted to leave, until they have undergone a screening process and are able to prove a sponsor"", OCHA said in a situation report.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned on Tuesday that the displaced people were at risk from communicable diseases and said procedures for people to leave the shelters ""should be accelerated"". 
""Many children who are already extremely weak are being exposed to further health hazards like diarrhea, lice and skin diseases. We have seen many children who had to walk many kilometers barefoot or in completely worn-out shoes,"" the ICRC said in a statement. 
Syrian state TV said the army freed 28 people who had been held captive by militants in Arbin. The Observatory said their release was part of the deal agreed by rebels.
Syrian state television Ikhbariya spoke to some of what it said were 315 men associated with rebel groups who had chosen not to go to Idlib but to reconcile with the government.
The interviewer asked the men, sitting on government buses in formerly rebel-held Harasta, to describe conditions under the rebels. 
One man said rebels had imprisoned him for 44 days for ""talking about them"". Several others described the situation as ""bad, very bad"".
One said they had been made to dig tunnels for the rebels. Another said the rebels had large food stores. ""We were surprised when we saw the rice, sugar, tea, bulgur wheat. While we were in need of rice.""
The government says the offensive is securing Damascus from insurgent mortar fire that regularly used to hit the capital including its Old City.

In addition to their foothold in the northwest, anti-Assad rebels still hold a chunk of territory along the southern frontier with Jordan and Israel, and enclaves near Damascus, Homs and Hama.

Entering the final week of hearings to decide whether the Australian cardinal will face trial, the author of ""Cardinal: The Rise and Fall of George Pell"", denied she had interfered with the course of justice by rushing publication of her book.
""Your book was intended to pervert the course of justice, was it not?"" Pell's lawyer Robert Richter asked author Louise Milligan, a journalist with Australian Broadcasting Corp.
""Absolutely not,"" she told the court.
Richter accused Milligan and her publishers Melbourne University Press of speeding up publication of the book by two months to May 2017 when they were aware charges against Pell were due to be announced in June.
Otherwise publication of the book, originally scheduled for July, would have been blocked, he said.
Milligan said she had no idea that there was any plan to charge Pell in June, but that her publisher wanted to get the book out because it was ""timely"".
""Your book was a prejudgment of guilt,"" Richter said.
""I don't agree with that, because I was very fair to the Cardinal in the book,"" Milligan said.
Richter told the Melbourne Magistrates' Court that Milligan had used ""character assassination"" in her book, associating Pell's name with other priests who had been accused of abuse and accepting some allegations made by some accusers at face value.
Pell is the most senior Catholic worldwide to be accused of sexual offences. Details of the charges associated with multiple complainants have not been made public.

Pell's lawyers have said he will plead not guilty to all charges. He is not required to enter a plea unless the magistrate determines there is cause for a full trial.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan has defended its record on nuclear safety after the United States sanctioned seven Pakistani companies over alleged links to the nuclear trade, saying the suspicions over the companies should not be used to discredit it.
Ties between the United States and nuclear-armed Pakistan have frayed in recent years over Pakistan's suspected support for Islamist militants waging war in Afghanistan, something Pakistani officials deny.
The U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security, Commerce imposed sanctions on the Pakistani companies on March 22, placing them on its ""Entity List"", making it harder for them to operate in the United States and do business with U.S. companies.
The sanctions could complicate Pakistan's bid to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group, a 48-nation club dedicated to curbing nuclear arms proliferation by controlling the export and re-transfer of materials that could foster nuclear weapons development.
Pakistan's foreign office said many companies around the world are placed on the U.S. commerce department's Entity List, including businesses from countries that are part of the NSG, and the sanctions should not be politicized by Pakistan's opponents.
""Pakistan's efforts in the area of export controls and non-proliferation as well as nuclear safety and security are well known. Pakistan and U.S. have a history of cooperation in these areas,"" the foreign office said in a statement late on Monday.
""We reject attempts by Pakistan’s detractors to exploit these listings to cast aspersions on Pakistan’s non-proliferation credentials.""
Pakistan applied to join the NSG in 2016 but little progress has been made.
The United States has been concerned about Pakistan's development of new nuclear weapons systems, including small tactical nuclear weapons, and has been trying to persuade it to make a unilateral declaration of ""restraint"".
The seven privately owned companies, which are little known in Pakistan, are accused of either being involved in ""proliferation of unsafeguarded nuclear activities"" or helping other Pakistani companies already on the Entity List.
Pakistani officials have in the past been accused of handing over nuclear secrets to North Korea. The government has denied the accusations.
A U.N. nuclear watchdog said in 2008 that a network around Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan, lionized at home as the father of Pakistan’s atomic bomb, smuggled nuclear weaponization blueprints to Iran, Libya and North Korea and was active in 12 countries.

Backed by air support, Turkish security forces opened fire and killed the militants after spotting them in Hatay's Arsuz district, near the Mediterranean Sea, the governor's office said in a statement.
It said the military seized the bodies of six of militants, along with M-16 rifles, a rocket launcher and ammunition. The group was believed to be behind several attacks in the province last year, it said.
Turkey has fought an insurgency with Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants since 1984 and more than 40,000 people have been killed in the fighting, which is largely focused in Turkey's southeast, hundreds of kilometers (miles) east of Hatay.
In January, Turkey's army and its Syrian rebel allies began a military offensive against the Kurdish YPG militia in Syria's Afrin, bordering Hatay, and gained full control of the region at the weekend, according to a military source. 
Separately, the Turkish Armed Forces said two Turkish soldiers died as a result of an improvised explosive device blast during search operations in Afrin region on Monday.
Turkey regards the YPG as terrorists and an extension of the outlawed PKK. The European Union and United States designate the PKK a terrorist group but the YPG is a U.S. partner in the fight against Islamic State jihadists in Syria.

KEMEROVO/MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin flew to the scene of a shopping mall fire in Siberia that killed 64 people and promised angry residents on Tuesday that those responsible for what he called criminal negligence would be punished.
The fire, at the Winter Cherry mall in the city of Kemerovo, killed 41 children, according to the Interfax news agency, and the calamitous way it was handled has stirred anger and focused attention on corruption and lax fire safety standards.
Rallies in memory of the victims were held in several cities around Russia, and at least one, in Moscow, turned into an anti-government demonstration. 
Putin, comfortably re-elected only this month, laid flowers at a memorial to the victims in the coal-producing region, about 3,600 km (2,200 miles) east of Moscow, before chairing a meeting and declaring Wednesday a national day of mourning. 
""What's happening here? This isn't war, it's not an unexpected methane explosion at a coal mine. People came to relax, children. We're talking about demography and losing so many people,"" Putin angrily told officials.
""Why? Because of some criminal negligence, because of slovenliness. How could this ever happen?"" he added. ""The first emotion when you hear about the number of dead and dead children is not to cry but to wail. And when you listen to what has been said here, to be honest, other emotions arise.""
Investigators said fire exits had been illegally blocked, the public address system had not been switched on, the alarm system was broken, and children had been locked inside cinemas.
ANGRY PROTESTS
The fire swept through the upper floors of the shopping centre, where a cinema complex and children's play area were located, on Sunday afternoon.
Hundreds of angry protesters, many of them crying, gathered in central Kemerovo. The mayor, Ilya Seredyuk, tried to speak, but his words were often drowned out by chants calling on him to resign.
""Why don’t they tell us the truth?"" shouted one protester.
Many locals do not believe the official death toll of 64 and suspect that hundreds of people were killed in the blaze and that a cover-up is under way, something Putin has flatly denied.
Relatives of victims say they have compiled a list of 85 people, most of them children, who are still missing.
Public anger in Kemerovo was reflected in protesters' placards. ""How many victims are there really?"" read one, while another suggested officials had taken bribes to sign off on the mall's fire safety. 
""Vova and Aman to prison!"" read another banner, referring to Putin and the local governor.
One senior regional official, Sergei Tsivilev, got down on his knees to apologise to the crowd. 
Natalia and Sergei Agarkov, whose two children were killed along with their grandmother, stood on the square holding pictures of them.
""Masha was 10, Kostya was eight,"" Sergei told Reuters. ""Masha ... was really good at sport. She should have run out, but everything was locked. I identified them yesterday. I didn't see Kostya, but recognised him by his little boots.""
ALARM NOT WORKING
Alexander Bastrykin, head of Russia's Investigative Committee, which handles major crimes, told Putin the fire alarm system in the mall had been out of order since March 19, and that a security guard had not turned on the public address system to warn people to evacuate the building.
He said five people had already been detained.
Replying to Putin, Bastrykin said most of the staff had run away and left parents and children to their fate: ""Those workers who should have been responsible for people's safety, for organising an evacuation, they were the first to run away.""
Candles were lit and flowers laid as rallies were held in several cities in memory of the Kemerovo victims, including two in St Petersburg and two in Moscow, on Manezhnaya and Pushkinskaya squares.
The latter has frequently been a venue for anti-government protests, and Tuesday's demonstration, attended by several thousand people including opposition leader Alexei Navalny, quickly took on a political tone.
Protesters held banners reading ""Bribes kill children"" and ""We demand a real investigation"", and some chanted ""Down with the cowardly regime!"", ""Putin - resign!"", ""What did the children die for?"" and ""We are sick and tired of him"", meaning Putin.
""It was the regime that caused the deaths ... The criminal regime should resign,"" said 43-year-old Innokentii, who works in the financial sector.

""The most awful thing is that no one is going to be really punished for this,"" said Kirill, 28. ""We've had that many times before.""

""At 9:39 am, she texted another message: 'Detained'."" Swanton wrote.
Mai Khoi updated her Facebook page later in the day to say that she has been released after eight hours.
""Thank you everyone for your care. I'm now on a public bus back to Hanoi,"" Khoi said alongside a photo of herself she posted to the page.
Calls to authorities at Noi Bai International airport and Mai Khoi's mobile phone went unanswered. Her husband confirmed she had been released.
""We have been evicted from our house three times now,"" Swanton said.
At least 129 people are currently detained in Vietnam for criticizing or protesting against the government, according to a February report by Human Rights Watch. 
A crackdown on dissent last year caused scores of activists to flee the country, according to Amnesty International.
Mai Khoi, who last year protested beside U.S. President Donald Trump's motorcade during his visit to Vietnam by holding up a poster which said ""Piss on you Trump"", had not yet been subjected to a travel ban by the Vietnamese authorities.
The 34-year-old has courted controversy under a government which, despite overseeing sweeping economic reforms and growing openness to social change, does not tolerate criticism. 
In 2016, she was one of a handful of activists who tried and failed to obtain a seat in the Communist party-dominated National Assembly. She met former U.S. President Barack Obama during his visit in Vietnam in 2015. 
The title of her new album ""Bat Dong"", which she had been in Europe to promote, translates to ""Disagreement"". Her song ""Please, sir"" pleads with the leader of the Communist Party to allow ordinary Vietnamese people to sing, publish, share and travel freely.

Sisi faces just one challenger, who is expected to barely register against the incumbent, whom he supports. Critics have slammed the election as a charade after more serious challengers were forced to step down.
Egyptian authorities hope that three days of voting will be enough to produce a decent turnout for Sisi. The president still has many supporters, but his austerity measures in recent years and a fierce crackdown on security have eroded some support.
Egypt's election commission said the election would be free and fair, and Sisi said he would have liked more candidates running.
Polls opened on Monday, with those who cast ballots saying they were voting for stability.
Sisi, an ex-general who in 2013 led the military overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood, is trying to defeat Islamist insurgents in the Sinai Peninsula and complete a series of mega-projects inaugurated with great fanfare since he came to power.
Sisi has said he will not seek a third term, but critics expect him to remove a two-presidential term limit.

He won nearly 97 percent of the vote in 2014, but less than half of eligible Egyptians voted, even though the election was extended to three days.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that Turkey's intelligence chief would meet an Iraqi official to discuss an Iraqi military operation in Sinjar, a region of Iraq bordering on Turkey, where Ankara says Kurdish militants have established a base.
Erdogan also said Turkey's would do ""what is necessary"" if the Iraqi operation in Sinjar failed.
The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state for decades. President Tayyip Erdogan said last week they were creating a new base in Sinjar, and that Turkish forces would attack it if necessary.
Sources in northern Iraq said on Friday the PKK would withdraw from Sinjar, where it gained a foothold in 2014 after coming to the aid of the Yazidi minority community, who were under attack by Islamic State militants.
The PKK, considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the European Union and the United States, has for decades been based in Iraq's Qandil mountain range, near the border with Iran.

423,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",Kenyan police detain opposition politician at airport in scuffle: lawyer,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - The lawyer of an opposition politician of dual Kenyan and Canadian citizenship said on Tuesday his client was detained by police at Nairobi airport during an attempt to force him onto a plane to Canada.
Miguna Miguna, a lawyer, was deported by Kenyan authorities in February for his role in a protest by opposition leader Raila Odinga, who maintains he was the winner of an election that returned President Uhuru Kenyatta to power last year.
Shortly before his deportation, which came after Odinga enraged the government by staging a symbolic ""swearing-in ceremony"", Miguna was charged with treason. More than 100 people were killed in unrest after last year's election.
Earlier this month a Kenyan court then ordered that Miguna's Kenyan passport be restored and that he be granted entry to the country. He landed at Nairobi's international airport on Monday afternoon, his lawyer Nelson Havi said.
Immigration officials asked Miguna on Tuesday to surrender his Canadian passport and refused to accept his Kenyan identity card as a valid travel document, Havi said. 
An hours-long standoff ensued before several dozen plainclothes officers dragged Miguna onto an Emirates airline plane bound for Dubai, opposition Senator James Orengo told Reuters.
Live footage broadcast by private Kenyan TV station Citizen showed Miguna in the doorway of what appeared to be an Emirates plane shouting at a crew member: ""I'm not going anywhere, you cannot take me from my country by force."" 
""There was an attempt to force him onto the plane and he resisted justifiably,"" said Orengo, who said he witnessed Miguna being ""terribly manhandled, pushed and dragged"" by plainclothes officers at the airport. 
Orengo said the officers then took the politician off the plane and briefly held him at airport immigration offices before taking him to a police station in the airport in the early hours of Tuesday.
Odinga came to the airport on Monday night to try to intervene on Miguna's behalf and said his Kenyan passport should be returned as a condition for political dialogue, according to Orengo.
An interior ministry statement released early Tuesday said Miguna became ""unruly and threw a tantrum"" at the airport and that he had demanded to be allowed to enter Kenya without being cleared through immigration.
""We have not denied him (entry), we just need him to follow the process like everybody else,"" Interior Ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka told Reuters via phone.
Kenya's biggest newspaper, the Daily Nation, reported that plainclothes police slapped and kicked journalists covering the incident. The Nation published a photo of one of its cameraman holding up his bloodied arm.
Odinga came to the airport on Monday night to attempt to lobby for Miguna to be admitted to the country, Orengo said. 
He said that the return of Miguna's passport was one condition for an enabling environment for political dialogue, but did not specify any new plans by the opposition. 

The scuffle at the airport comes after Odinga and Kenyatta announced they would heal their divisions and vowed to unify Kenya in a surprise announcement on March 9.

424,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 01:31AM ET</span>",Philippines says has no proof yet on rights groups links with drug lords,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine law enforcement agencies still have no proof yet on allegations made by two government officials that human rights groups may have become the ""unwitting tools"" of drug lords, police and drug enforcement agency officials said on Tuesday.
Rights groups have denounced President Rodrigo Duterte's ferocious war on drugs, in which thousands of people have been killed, either by police or by shadowy, unidentified masked gunmen on motorcycles.
The mercurial leader, who says he must be tough to protect the people from the scourge of drugs, has criticised rights groups by saying they were ""trivialising"" his campaign and unjustly blaming the authorities for bloodshed.
""We have no (proof) right now,"" national police spokesman Chief Superintendent John Bulalacao told reporters when asked about proof of links between drug syndicates and human rights groups.
""We are still validating reports that drug syndicates might be using human right groups to discredit the efforts of the government,"" he said.
Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency spokesman Derrick Carreon said the reports that drug lords were using rights groups to attack the government's anti-drug efforts were based on recent findings that would have to be investigated. 
""We still have to dig further on this,"" he told a regular news briefing at the presidential palace. Carreon said more than 123,000 drug suspects had been arrested since July 2016, which he said showed anti-drugs operations were not about killings.
He said law enforcement agencies welcomed any criticism from rights groups and allowed them to observe anti-drug operations to prove that everything was done according to the rule of law.
""We have made adjustments on the ground in order that we would not be criticised negatively in the conduct of our anti-drugs operations,"" Carreon said. 
Duterte's spokesman and foreign secretary did not present any evidence when they told reporters drug lords were using human rights groups to undermine the policy, statements against which the Human Rights Watch protested and said were ""shameful"" and risked provoking violence.
The anti-narcotics campaign has raised international alarm and drawn criticism from some U.N. representatives, including High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, who suggested recently that Duterte needed to see a psychiatrist.

Police say they have killed nearly 4,200 drug suspects who were violently resisting arrest since the launch of the crackdown 20 months ago, which Duterte has vowed to pursue until he steps down in June 2022.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bangladesh is not expecting much help from foreign donors as it forges ahead with plans to relocate 100,000 Rohingya refugees to an uninhabited island, an undertaking that does not yet have a timeline, a state minister said in an interview. 
The minister of state for foreign affairs, Mohammed Shahriar Alam, told Reuters on Friday that Bangladesh was paying the entire roughly $280 million to build homes and fortify the muddy island in the Bay of Bengal from cyclones, and that it was mulling a formal request for international funds. 
No refugees who fled a military crackdown in Myanmar would be moved there against their will, he added. 
Some 700,000 Rohingya Muslims crossed the border from Myanmar's Rakhine state since August, and are in cramped camps at Cox's Bazar. Because a repatriation deal between the neighboring countries has been delayed, Bangladesh aims to prepare new homes on the nearby island, called Bhasan Char, before the onset of seasonal monsoon rains that could come in late April.
""We don't have a timeline because it's a lot of money,"" Alam said at Bangladesh's United Nations office in New York. ""We are so far building it with our own finances. I am not very hopeful about how much funds the international community will be able to raise.""
The latest wave of refugees joined about 300,000 Rohingya already in Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest and most crowded countries, who fled previous bouts of violence. A U.N. coordination branch has separately requested $951 million for immediate relief. 
Alam pointed to blueprints of construction on the island 30 km (21 miles) from the mainland, and said one plan could be to bring potential donors there. (For an interactive graphic of the island, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2C6gWk5)
He brushed off as ""misunderstandings"" concerns raised by humanitarian groups such as Amnesty International that the silt island was vulnerable to flooding. ""Some people raised concerns about Bhasan Char (but) there is absolutely no reason to be concerned because we are building an embankment,"" he said. 
Bangladesh sees the island as a temporary arrangement for refugees but has given conflicting signals on how much freedom they would have to leave once there. 

Alam said Bangladesh shared the building designs with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, which suggested ""we engage people, countries and organizations to come help and contribute"" to the cost. ""We are yet to do it,"" the minister said. ""We haven't decided on that.""

427,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 06:38AM ET</span>",Train believed carrying top North Korean delegation leaves Beijing,"By Ben Blanchard and Christine Kim
BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - A train believed to be carrying a senior North Korean delegation left the Chinese capital on Tuesday following a dramatic whirlwind visit that some reports said included the country's leader, Kim Jong Un.
The conservative South Korea Chosun Ilbo newspaper, citing an unnamed senior intelligence official, said the delegation had included Kim and that he had since left to return to North Korea. 
South Korea's left-leaning press Hankyoreh also reported Kim had traveled to Beijing for meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday afternoon before leaving for a ""third location"" on Tuesday. It did not cite specific sources. 
The Hankyoreh did not specify where the ""third location"" was but said it could be in China.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post said Kim was on the train that left Beijing, citing two anonymous sources.
South Korea said it was closely watching events in Beijing, where a foreign ministry spokeswoman deflected a question on whether Kim, his sister or some other senior North Korean was visiting. South Korea's spy agency declined to confirm the report. 
""At present I have no understanding of the situation you mention. If there is news we will release it,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular daily briefing.
Diplomatic sources in Beijing said a senior North Korean official was in town, but did not know exactly who.
Bloomberg, citing three unidentified sources, reported late on Monday that Kim was in Beijing in what would be his first known trip outside North Korea since taking power in 2011. 
The unconfirmed visit came ahead of planned summit meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and U.S. President Donald Trump.
""The presidential Blue House is watching things in Beijing very closely, while keeping all possibilities open,"" said the senior official in Seoul, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Improving ties between North Korea, which is pursuing nuclear and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and China would be a positive sign before the planned summits, he said.
A Reuters reporter saw a convoy leave Beijing's Diaoyutai State Guest House, where senior foreign leaders often stay, and drive north on Tuesday morning. It was unclear where the convoy was headed.
Later, a Reuters journalist saw what was believed to be the delegation's train pulling out of a Beijing station. The group was reported to have arrived in China on Sunday after crossing from North Korea in the border city of Dandong.
A senior U.S. official who follows North Korea closely said the available evidence suggested that Kim had traveled to Beijing to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, but stressed that has not been confirmed.
Underscoring the mystery, one senior Beijing-based diplomatic source told Reuters simply: ""We just don't know.""
One source with ties to China's leadership said it was possible Kim's younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, was in town. She visited South Korea for the Winter Olympics last month, paving the way for a summit between the two Koreas.
South Korean news agency Newsis reported that Kim Yo Jong and the North's ceremonial leader, Kim Yong Nam, were visiting Beijing, citing an unidentified North Korea-related source in Beijing.
The pair visited South Korean President Moon Jae-in at his office in Seoul during the Winter Olympics in February.
The U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was unlikely Kim Jong Un would have sent his sister on such an important mission, unlike her ceremonial visit to South Korea for the Olympics.
On the contrary, the official said, a summit with Xi would underscore Kim's standing as a world leader.
""LOT OF LEVERAGE""
Xi and Kim Jong Un had reasons to meet in advance of Kim's meetings with Moon and possibly Trump, the U.S. official said.
""Xi has met Trump, and in many respects learned how to deal with him better than some people here do,"" the official said.
""At the same time, despite the recent tensions, he needs to know what Kim has in mind for dealing with the South and the U.S., and he still has a lot of leverage with the North.""
Japanese media reported on Monday that a high-ranking Pyongyang official appeared to have arrived by train in Beijing.
The Blue House official said South Korea had been aware of ""related movements"" in North Korea, such as the train, for a few days but he could not confirm whether Kim or another high-ranking North Korean official was visiting China.
Beijing is the main ally of secretive and isolated North Korea, as well as its biggest trading partner.
China has not confirmed any visit by a North Korean but has not totally censored speculation.
There were posts on Chinese social media talking about the possibility Kim Jong Un was in China, some citing family members in Dandong. The rail journey between Dandong and Beijing covers more than 1,100 km (680 miles). It takes at least 14 hours by ordinary service, according to Chinese railway timetables. 
The North Korean leader is due to hold separate summits with South Korea in late April and the United States in May.
""The fact that the summits are being held has been beyond our expectations. Right now, the situation surrounding the Korean peninsula is moving very quickly and it would be inadvisable to think with prejudice,"" the Blue House official said.
Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, met then-president Jiang Zemin in China in 2000 before a summit between the two Koreas in June that year.
Kim Jong Il was considered at the time to have made the visit to reaffirm close ties with China.
""North Korea likely wants to confirm its relationship with China and believes it has some leverage with which it can ask for things from China,"" said Yoo Ho-yeol, Professor of North Korean studies at Seoul's Korea University.

""If North Korea speaks with the United States on its own, it might feel it is at a disadvantage but, if it has China as an ally, Pyongyang may think it will be able to protect its interests and profits during the summits.""

""William Strampel is currently lodged at the Ingham County jail,"" Ingham County Sheriff Scott Wriggelsworth told Reuters. 
Wriggelsworth declined to say on what charges Strampel, 70, was arrested until the defendant was arraigned at a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday. 
A jail website listed the former dean of Michigan State's College of Osteopathic Medicine as an inmate there but gave no other information.
The Detroit Free-Press newspaper reported that he faces multiple charges, at least one a felony. 
An attorney for Strampel, who has been on medical leave from the university since December, could not be reached by Reuters for comment on Monday evening. 
Michigan State University President John Engler said in February he was moving to revoke tenure for Strampel for failing to enforce 2014 guidelines created for Nassar in treating young athletes after complaints of sexual misconduct against him. 
The college has been criticized for its handling of complaints about Nassar stretching back for years. 
Michigan State terminated Nassar in September 2016 for his failure to follow those protocols, including having another person present when he performed the procedures. 
Numerous women said they were assaulted even after the guidelines were put in place. 
Nassar was sentenced in February to up to 125 years in prison after some 200 young women testified about decades of abuse at his hands.
He had already received a sentence up to 175 years in a neighboring Michigan county, and was sentenced to a 60-year federal term for child pornography convictions.

FALKLAND ISLANDS (Reuters) - Dalal and Carlos Massad knelt in front of their son Marcelo's grave in the Falkland Islands, kissing the tomb beneath a white cross for the first time since his death in combat some 36 years ago.
For most of that time, the plaque on Marcelo's grave read ""Argentine soldier known only to God.""
But after forensic scientists identified the remains of 90 Argentine soldiers buried in the Darwin Cemetery following the country's 1982 conflict with Britain, a group of around 250 relatives made an unprecedented trip to the disputed islands on Monday to visit their loved ones' graves.
""I found my son, I spoke with him, I asked him questions, I shared my feelings with him, my pain,"" Dalal Massad said. ""I feel at peace because I know where he is.""
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) began interviewing families of fallen Argentine soldiers in 2012, and 107 consented to DNA testing. Scientists analyzed 122 sets of human remains buried in the wind-swept cemetery in the South Atlantic. 
During Britain's two-month war to reclaim the Falklands, 255 British troops and about 650 Argentine soldiers were killed. The majority of the Argentines who perished were on a Navy ship that sank. 
Argentina still claims the islands, which it calls the Malvinas. But the South American country signed an agreement with Britain in 2016 to try to identify the soldiers and divide the costs. The ICRC forensic scientists began their efforts last June.
""Speaking for the state, I think we have taken an enormous step toward closing a debt we had to the families and to the heroes of the Malvinas,"" Claudio Avruj, Argentina's human rights secretary, said at the ceremony.
Relatives of the buried soldiers sobbed, prayed, and comforted each other as they became some of the only Argentine citizens to visit the site of their country's biggest military conflict of recent decades. 
They listened as Scots Guards members played bagpipes against a backdrop of vast, grassy plains, and some relatives collected stones to bring back to the mainland. 
""For me as a military man, I think it is very, very important that the families have been able to come here today to now actually see a name on a grave and be able to pay their respects,"" said Brigadier Baz Bennett, Commander of the British Forces South Atlantic Islands. 
Relatives of fallen soldiers who have not been identified also attended the ceremony. Nora Dimotta, whose son Raul never returned from the war, cried in front of one of the dozens of still-unmarked graves. 
""This is not the final step, this is the beginning,"" said Norma Gomez, whose brother Eduardo was identified. ""This process will continue until all the missing soldiers are identified.""

430,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 09:01PM ET</span>",Trump fundraiser sues Qatar over hacked emails,"(Reuters) - Elliott Broidy, a top Republican fundraiser, sued Qatar on Monday, accusing the Gulf state of pilfering and leaking emails in retribution for his attempts to influence the Trump administration in favor of regional rivals of Qatar.
In the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Broidy accused Qatar and its agents of hacking into his and his wife's email accounts and providing the stolen documents, via U.S.-based lobbyists, to media outlets in order to plant damaging articles about him. 
The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, says some of the leaked materials were doctored.
""We believe the evidence is clear that a nation state is waging a sophisticated disinformation campaign against me in order to silence me,"" Broidy said in a statement.
The lawsuit adds a new dimension to a diplomatic crisis in the Gulf set off when the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt imposed sanctions on Qatar last June.
The boycott was based on allegations that Qatar supports Islamic extremists and regional foe Iran. Qatar denies the charges.
Jassim Al-Thani, a spokesman at Qatar's embassy in Washington, described the lawsuit as an attempt by Broidy to divert attention from media scrutiny on his activities.
""It is Mr. Broidy, not Qatar, who orchestrated nefarious activities designed to influence Congress and American foreign policy,"" Al-Thani said in a statement.
Broidy, a vocal critic of Qatar, met with Trump in September and tried to set up an informal meeting between the president and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan of the UAE, according to a person familiar with the matter.
While the meeting did not materialize, the episode highlighted the influential role Broidy, the deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, has developed in the administration.
Broidy, whose company is based in California, finalized more than $200 million worth of defense contracts with the UAE government and is in talks on similar deals with Saudi Arabia, the lawsuit says. 
Broidy cited several articles that he believes were prompted by the leaking of his emails and other documents.
Broidy claims Al Jazeera published an article on March 8 based on falsified documents accusing him of entering into a lobbying contract in 2014 with a Russian bank under U.S. sanctions.
Al Jazeera did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
Broidy accused Nicolas Muzin, a Washington-based lobbyist whose firm has a $300,000 per month contract with Qatar, of helping to wage a campaign to discredit Broidy's efforts to ""educate the American people about Qatar."" Muzin was also named as a defendant in the suit.
""Mr Broidy’s lawsuit is an obvious attempt to draw attention away from his controversial work, and is as flimsy as the promises he reportedly made to his clients,"" Muzin said in a statement, saying he was proud of the work he did for Qatar.

431,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2018 02:54PM ET</span>","Before expulsions, a brick-by-brick hardening of U.S. stance toward Russia","By Phil Stewart and Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - America's most sweeping expulsion of Russian diplomats since the Cold War may have seemed like a dramatic escalation in Washington's response to Moscow, but the groundwork for a more confrontational U.S. posture had been taking shape for months -- in plain sight.
While President Donald Trump's conciliatory rhetoric toward Moscow has dominated headlines, officials at the U.S. State Department, Pentagon and White House made a series of lower-profile decisions over the past year to counter Russia around the world - from Afghanistan to North Korea to Syria.
The State Department earlier in March announced plans to provide anti-tank missiles to Ukraine to defend against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Trump's predecessor as president, Barack Obama, had declined to do so over fears of provoking Moscow.
In Syria last month, the U.S. military killed or injured as many as 300 men working for a Kremlin-linked private military firm after they attacked U.S. and U.S.-backed forces. The White House, meanwhile, firmly tied Russia to deadly strikes on civilians in Syria's eastern Ghouta region. 
Both the White House and Pentagon's top policy documents unveiled in January portrayed Russia as an adversary that had returned to the center of U.S. national security planning. 
That was all before the United States said on Monday it would expel 60 Russian diplomats, joining governments across Europe in punishing the Kremlin for a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain that they have blamed on Moscow.
Russia has denied any involvement.
With Monday's announcement, however, it was unclear whether Trump is promoting - or just acquiescing to - the tougher U.S. stance developed by his advisers and generals.
Trump's critics sought to portray him as a reluctant actor in any get-tough approach to Russia, even though one senior administration official described him as involved ""from the beginning"" in the expulsions of Russian diplomats.
""It is disturbing how grudgingly he came to this decision,"" said U.S. Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee.
Still, the Trump administration's actions run counter to widespread perception, fueled by the president's own statements, that Trump has softened America's stance toward Russian President Vladimir Putin amid a U.S. investigation into Moscow's meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
Regardless of the tough actions, the inconsistent messaging may undermine Washington's strategy to deter Moscow's aggressive behavior, experts warn. 
""U.S. signaling is all undercut by Trump's lack of seriousness about Russia,"" said Andrew Weiss, a Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
Just last Tuesday, Trump congratulated Putin on his re-election, drawing sharp criticism from fellow Republicans.
But in another sign of mixed messaging, Trump two days later named John Bolton, a strident Russia hawk, to become his national security adviser.
DOWNWARD SPIRAL 
Although the nerve agent attack was the official trigger for the U.S. expulsions, Trump administration officials warned that the attack should not be viewed in isolation, citing a series of destabilizing and aggressive actions by Moscow.
In Afghanistan, Trump's top commander on the ground accused Russia again last week of arming Taliban militants.
On North Korea, Trump himself told Reuters in January that Russia was helping Pyongyang evade United Nations sanctions.
And less than two weeks ago, the Trump administration imposed the first sanctions against Russia for election meddling and cyber attacks, though it held off on punishing business magnates close to Putin.
U.S. officials and experts widely expect ties to further deteriorate, at least in the near term, and caution that Russia's next steps could extend far beyond retaliation against American diplomats.
""The risk of escalation doesn't just come from tit-for-tat punishments,"" said Matthew Rojansky, a Russia expert at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington, citing the potential for more aggressive moves from the Middle East to the cyber realm.

U.S. officials have said the Trump administration still seeks to avoid a complete rupture in bilateral relations. One official said Russian cooperation was still sought to address thorny diplomatic issues like North Korea and Iran.

However, Lula will not be imprisoned until the country's Supreme Court decides on April 4 whether to accept his request that he be allowed to exhaust his appeals process before landing in jail.
The Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that defendants should begin serving prison sentences after their conviction was upheld on a first appeal. However, several members of the court are pressing to revisit that decision and perhaps reverse it. 
Lula, Brazil's first working-class leader, remains the most popular politician in Latin America's biggest nation. He oversaw years of robust growth and falling inequality during a commodity boom last decade, and wants to run again for president.
Whether he is jailed or not, Lula is barred from running due to his conviction for receiving as a bribe a seaside apartment from an entrepreneur awarded government contracts during his presidency.
In January, the appeals court in Porto Alegre upheld Lula's conviction and increased his sentence to more than 12 years.
Despite that conviction and Lula facing six other corruption trials, he continues to enjoy wide popularity and leads all early polls for the Oct. 7 vote.
His supporters maintain he is being persecuted politically with dubious accusations aimed at keeping him out of the race.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's new president Cyril Ramaphosa will need to call on all his dealmaking skills to overhaul ailing state-owned firms and tackle land reform if he wants to capitalize on Moody's decision not to downgrade the country's debt to junk.
Moody's said its decision to keep South Africa's rating at investment grade reflected its view the country's institutions would regain strength under more transparent and predictable policies - though the new government had to stay on track.
Since replacing Jacob Zuma in February, Ramaphosa has reappointed the finance minister his predecessor fired in 2015, sacked some ministers allied to Zuma, put another respected former finance minister in charge of struggling state-owned firms and suspended the head of the revenue service.
""It's a big deal,"" political analyst Ralph Mathekga said about Moody's decision. ""What he has been able to achieve in two months is to reverse some of Zuma's influence in key sectors. The message he sent is: 'I can do more'.""
After his whirlwind start, Ramaphosa's challenges now include keeping the unions on side as the government overhauls cash-strapped national carrier South African Airways (SAA) and heavily indebted state power utility Eskom.
Perhaps his stiffest test will be to push through land expropriation, as promised, to address racial disparities in ownership - while keeping the left wing of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) on board and not scaring off investors.
Parliament passed a motion last month seeking to change the constitution to allow land expropriation without compensation. Ramaphosa has promised to speed up the transfer of land to black people, but has stressed the need to preserve food security.
""A big deliverable is to initiate the land debate under his leadership to control the narrative and discourse. Should he fail to do this, he runs the risk of undoing the good work already done,"" said Daniel Silke, director of Political Futures Consultancy.
Ramaphosa's negotiating skills have been respected for decades, ever since Nelson Mandela turned to the former trade union boss to lead the successful negotiations to end white minority rule.
More recently, Ramaphosa had to strike a fine balance between applying pressure on Zuma to go, while still affording him a dignified exit. Now, same analysts say land reform is Ramaphosa's litmus test.
""Are we over-estimating Ramaphosa's ability to deal with this land issue? It is undoubtedly one of his biggest challenges. Investors are worried about this and watching him very closely,"" said independent political analyst Nic Borain.
'GOOD NEGOTIATOR'
When it comes to South Africa's struggling state-run companies, Ramaphosa will need to perform a similar balancing act and he has already named respected former finance minister Pravin Gordhan as minister of public enterprises.
Eskom and SAA are both weighed down by massive wage bills but the country's powerful unions are likely to dig in their heels at any attempt to cut jobs, especially with elections looming in 2019.
Influential labor leaders, sections of the ANC and the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters are also likely to balk at any moves to partially privatize the companies, which is one strategy backed by the Treasury.
South African Airways runs one of Africa's biggest fleets but years of operational losses have left it on the brink of bankruptcy. It needed a bailout in July to repay debt and 20 billion rand ($2 billion) in state guarantees to keep it afloat.
Eskom received a 5-billion rand loan in February from the state's Public Investment Corporation (PIC), which holds a large amount of government bonds and ranks as Africa's biggest investment fund, or it would have defaulted on its debts.
""There is going to be some tension when these job cuts are announced. It is a delicate balance because it could impact the support base of the party ahead of next year's elections,"" said Borain.
Still, Ramaphosa has already taken the politically risky step of raising value-added tax (VAT) for the first time since apartheid to try to reduce the budget deficit and analysts say he is unlikely to back down on reforms.
""He did not give in to populism on the VAT; this was a good example of him having to do something unpopular but necessary,"" Borain said. ""He is known to be a good negotiator.""
Finance minister Nhlanhla Nene expressed hope on Monday that S&P Global Ratings and Fitch might also look favorably on South Africa during upcoming reviews, saying investors he had met at a roadshow in London before Moody's decision were upbeat.
S&P downgraded South African local currency debt to ""junk"" in November citing a deterioration in the economic outlook and public finances. Fitch cut its rating in April to sub-investment grade after Zuma fired Gordhan as finance minister. S&P will publish its review on May 25. Fitch has not given a date.
""I want to call this a honeymoon phase - and it is for that reason that we cannot be complacent about it,"" Nene told Talk Radio 702.

Zeman's request followed strong government rebuttals of Russian allegations that the nerve agent could have come from the Czech Republic, among other countries.
The Czech Republic joined the United States and governments across Europe to expel more than 100 Russian diplomats on Monday in response to the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain.
Moscow has denied being behind the attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury on March 4. Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia remain critically ill in hospital.
Zeman's request to look into whether the Czechs produced the nerve agent Novichok was announced by his spokesman after the president met the head of the BIS counter-intelligence service.
""The president has tasked the BIS to find out whether or not the nerve gas 'Novichok' was developed or stored on the Czech Republic's territory, be it at industrial or scientific facilities,"" Zeman's spokesman said in a statement.
The spokesman later said on Twitter, in reaction to a news website headline that interpreted the decision as siding with Russia: ""Fake news. The tasking of BIS is a reaction to Russia's repeated allegations against the Czech Republic.""
Zeman has often taken pro-Russian positions in the past.
Under the Czech constitution, the government is in charge of foreign policy but the president wields certain powers as well as the ability to ask the BIS to carry out tasks.
Commenting on the expulsion of three Russian diplomats, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said it was in solidarity with Britain and he denied Moscow's suggestion the nerve agent could have originated in the Czech Republic.
""The Russians breached all boundaries when they said the poisonous substance Novichok may have come from us, that is a total lie, we have rejected this assertion right from the start when the Russian side put it out."" 

The government's spokeswoman had no immediate comment on Zeman's request for the counter-intelligence service to investigate the claim.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles has decided to resign next week and attempt to run for president or be President Michel Temer's running mate if he makes a bid, government sources and a ruling party leader said on Monday.
Temer's chief of staff Eliseu Padilha said Meirelles, 72, a former banking executive and central bank governor, will quit his post and join the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB) party.
That opens the possibility that he will be its presidential candidate if Temer, whose popularity polls show is in the single-digits, does not run or be on the ticket as vice president if he does.
Temer's Minister of Political Affairs Carlos Marun confirmed that Meirelles was joining the MDB ticket for the Oct. 7 election.
""The natural candidate is President Temer, but if he does not want it or can't run, minister Meirelles' candidacy would be very welcome,"" Marun told Reuters.
Under Brazil's electoral laws, if Meirelles wants to be a candidate, he has to quit the ministry by April 7.
A presidential aide said Meirelles discussed his future on Friday and Saturday, and Meirelles proposed Finance Ministry secretaries Mansueto Almeida and Eduardo Guardia as potential replacements.
Temer's closest political allies want him to run to continue his government's fiscal adjustment program, but party members do not see how he can win, while Meirelles, if not any more popular, has a lower disapproval rating than the president.
Pollster Ibope found in December that only 6 percent of Brazilians think Temer is doing a good or great job, while 74 percent see him as bad or terrible. 

Political analysts Say Temer need at least a 15-percent approval rating to enter the campaign, and to lower his disapproval to close to 50 percent to stand any chance of winning.

A lower court jailed Basuki Tjahaja Purnama for blasphemy last May after a doctored and incorrectly subtitled video spread on social media that appeared to show him insulting the Koran.
At the time, Purnama, who is popularly known as Ahok, was popular and looked set for re-election to govern the capital of a country with the largest Muslim population in the world. But Islamists led mass rallies calling for him to be unseated and hardline groups urged voters to elect a Muslim rival instead.
Purnama lost the election, was jailed and filed for a judicial review of his case last month. 
""All the reasons for the appeal put forward by Ahok's team were rejected by the judge,"" said court spokesman Suhadi. He did not explain the court's reasoning further.
The person who doctored the video was imprisoned for 18 months late last year when a court found him guilty of violating information technology laws and Purnama's lawyers tried to use this to argue his conviction was flawed.

Indonesia is a secular state with a Muslim majority and several religious minorities but the case of Purnama, who is ethnic Chinese, and the rise of hardline Muslim groups casts doubt on the country's reputation for tolerance and diversity.

438,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",French police investigate possible anti-Semitic killing in Paris,"PARIS (Reuters) - French police are investigating whether the death of an elderly Jewish woman stabbed and burnt to death in her Paris apartment last week was an anti-Semitic murder, a judicial source said on Monday. 
Mirelle Knoll, an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor, was found dead on Friday inside the blackened remains of her apartment, which police suspect was set ablaze after she was attacked.
Two suspects have been detained but have not yet been charged. 
The investigation by the Paris prosecutor's office is trying to establish whether it was a killing ""motivated by the real or supposed adherence to a religion"", the source said. 
France's chief rabbi described Knoll's death as a ""horror"". Jewish leaders have called for a march in her memory.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, who is visiting Israel, said the theory that Knoll's death was anti-Semitic was plausible.
""It reminds us of the fundamental and permanent side of this battle (against anti-Semitism),"" he said, speaking alongside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after visiting the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum.
As a child in Paris, Knoll managed to evade the round-up of Jews during World War Two, Paris lawmaker Meyer Habib said.
Thousands of Jews were brought to the Velodrome d'Hiver cycling track in 1942 and sent on to Nazi death camps.
France is home to western Europe's biggest Jewish population and many in the 400,000-strong community have complained for years of a rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes.
In 2015, vandals desecrated 250 tombstones in a Jewish cemetery in eastern France days after four Jews were killed in an attack on a kosher grocery in Paris.
Knoll's killing took place a year to the day after the murder of Sarah Halimi-Attal, a 65-year-old whose death prosecutors believe was anti-Semitic.
""The horror of the crime and the violence of the executioners are identical and reflect the negation of the human face,"" Chief Rabbi Haim Korsia said in a tweet.

All other insurgent groups there have agreed to surrender their territory in deals mediated by the government's ally Moscow, bringing President Bashar al-Assad to the cusp of his biggest victory over the rebels in more than a year.
But the Jaish al-Islam group has kept hold of the town of Douma. ""The negotiations are still ongoing without reaching a final agreement till this moment,"" said spokesman Hamza Birqdar in a social media message.
A Russian officer earlier said on Monday the group had signaled during talks it was ready to lay down its arms. ""(This) is a lie and devoid of truth,"" Birqdar said. ""An attempt to insist on forced displacement will be catastrophic,"" he added.
The group's fighters skirmished with the Syrian army on one front of the Douma pocket on Monday, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitoring group. The army fired shells into the town, it added. 
Under the Russian deals, scores of buses have left the area since Thursday carrying fighters from other rebel groups, their families and civilians who do not want to come back under Assad's rule, to opposition areas in northwestern Syria. 
On Monday, a long line of buses stood waiting at a road junction, waiting to take thousands more people north.
They were leaving the towns of Arbin, Zamalka, Ein Terma and Jobar after the Failaq al-Rahman group which held the area agreed a surrender deal on Friday. 
BUSES LEAVE
More than 40 buses had filled with evacuees by Monday afternoon, after scores had left from there and from a separate enclave in the town of Harasta, where rebels accepted a deal on Thursday. 
Footage on state television on Monday showed four small children looking from the window of one bus as it prepared to depart, and another driving past an immense billboard depicting Assad's father, who ruled Syria from 1971-2000. 
Pro-opposition Orient television showed an earlier convoy that had arrived in Idlib from eastern Ghouta. People clambered off buses, lifting small children and large sacks of belongings. A fighter with a rifle slung over his shoulder stood nearby. 
Russia has promised the rebels will be safe, but insurgent groups have said they do not trust Moscow to protect them. 
Syria's government has won a string of victories since Russia entered the war on his side in 2015, often using siege and bombardment to force rebels to surrender. 
A full conquest of eastern Ghouta would be Assad's biggest win since driving rebels from Aleppo in December 2016, though insurgents remain entrenched in areas of northwestern and southwestern Syria.
Western countries and rights groups have accused Damascus and Moscow of indiscriminate bombardment, including the targeting of civilian infrastructure and the use of barrel bombs, chlorine gas and incendiary explosives. 
They deny that and say their offensives, including the one against eastern Ghouta which started on Feb. 18 with a crushing bombardment, are necessary to free civilians from the rule of Islamist militants and end mortar attacks on government areas.

The National Prosecuting Authority earlier this month said it would seek to prosecute Zuma on 16 charges, including fraud, racketeering, corruption and money laundering.
The case is a dramatic development on a continent where leaders rarely face their accusers in court.
""It was served at my Durban offices. The court date is April 6,"" Michael Hulley told Reuters by telephone, referring to the summons. He declined to comment on how his client would respond.
Zuma has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.
Zuma, who was forced to resign by his ruling African National Congress last month, was at the center of a 1990s deal to buy European military kit that has cast a shadow over politics in South Africa for years.
Zuma was deputy president at the time of the arms deal. Schabir Shaikh, his former financial adviser, was found guilty and jailed in 2005 for trying to solicit bribes for Zuma from a French arms company.
The previous charges were filed against Zuma but then dropped by the NPA shortly before he successfully ran for president in 2009.

Since his election nine years ago, his opponents have fought a lengthy legal battle to have the charges reinstated. Zuma countered with his own legal challenges.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Khattab Jalal, 27, was asleep on Sunday night in the home in eastern Riyadh that he shared with 15 other Egyptian construction workers when the sound of explosions jolted him awake.
An enormous hole had opened in the peeling green-painted ceiling of their home, which was filled with smoke and debris. He and the others ran outside, but realized that one of their housemates was not with them.
Thirty-eight-year-old Abdul Muntaleb Ali, sleeping on a thin blue mattress on the floor beside three others, had been killed when debris from a ballistic missile fired by Yemen's Houthi militia group crashed through their roof shortly before midnight on Sunday.
With that, he became the first person to die in the Saudi capital as a result of a Saudi-led coalition's three-year military campaign against the Houthis and their allies - a war that has already claimed at least 10,000 lives in Yemen and left around 22 million people in need of humanitarian aid.
Three of Ali's roommates, one of whom was his brother, were wounded in the attack, Jalal told Reuters the following morning.
""For three years he didn't leave (Saudi Arabia). He hasn't seen his kids,"" Jalal said. ""You're with your friend and you're having dinner together - and a few hours later, you wake up and find him dead.""
Saudi forces destroyed three missiles over northeastern Riyadh late on Sunday, as well as four others fired simultaneously at the southern cities of Najran, Jizan and Khamis Mushait, the coalition said in a statement.
The attacks, which coincided with the third anniversary of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, marked a sharp escalation in the conflict and stripped away the sense of calm in a city that, until recent months, had never quite felt at war.
A NEW KIND OF FEAR
Haila Zayed, a 27-year-old Saudi, clutched her infant son in a panic when she heard the explosions overhead. She could feel the car shaking as her husband drove.
""I always enjoyed the safety and security in my country. For the first time I felt the kind of fear that people have at war,"" she said. ""May God protect our country and keep it safe.""
For its part, the Saudi-led coalition has carried out thousands of air strikes in Yemen since launching operations after the Houthis, allied with Iran, seized the capital Sanaa and forced President Abd Rabbu Mansour al-Hadi to flee.
Discussion of Sunday's missile attack flooded Twitter on Monday, with pleas to keep Saudi Arabia secure and condolences for Ali topping the list of trending hashtags in the kingdom.
Many prominent Saudis, including newspaper columnists, clerics and members of the advisory Shura Council, urged people not to share videos and photos of the attacks, saying they would feed into Houthi propaganda.
In malls, cafes and supermarkets around Riyadh, Saudis digested the escalation in their own ways.
For Abdulrahman al-Sari, who lives in Riyadh but hails from the frequently targeted southern province of Najran, the situation was too familiar to faze him. ""For me it was normal,"" he said with a shrug. ""We're used to it.""
Others emerged from the experience chastened and defiant.
""I want to pick up a gun, put on a uniform and go join the brave Saudi soldiers stationed on the border,"" said Fahad Matar al-Shelahy, a student at a technical college in Riyadh.
""If they give orders for people to join the soldiers, I will be the first. We all wish to be martyrs defending our country.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The number of Jews and Arabs between the Mediterranean Sea and Jordan River is at or near parity, figures cited by Israeli officials show, raising questions whether Israel can remain a democracy if it keeps territory where Palestinians seek a state. 
The population statistics were mentioned in an Israeli parliamentary statement on Monday summing up legislators' questioning of an official of Israel's military-run civil administration (COGAT) that coordinates government activities in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip.
Demography is studied closely on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict because of its potential implications for both societies as they weigh possible solutions as Israel celebrates its 70th anniversary next month.
With over a ""two-state solution"" frozen since 2014, some argue that if Israel becomes a binational state through annexation of land seized 51 years ago, it could one day be forced to choose between remaining a democracy or securing a Jewish majority by denying Palestinians the vote.
""We estimate the (Palestinian) population in Judea and Samaria at between 2.5 million and 2.7 million,"" Colonel Uri Mendes, COGAT's deputy director, using Israel's term for the West Bank, told a session of the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee. He noted that a Palestinian census put the figure even higher, at 3 million.
Avi Dichter, the committee's chairman and a former head of Israel's Shin Bet security service, responded that with the addition of Gaza's 2 million Palestinians, that meant there was now a total of about five million Palestinians living in the two territories that fell to Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
Taking the higher end of the Israeli figures cited and adding them to the 1.84 million Arabs living inside Israel, according to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), would bring the total number of Arabs in Israel and the Israeli-occupied territories to around 6.5 million.
This is around the same number of Jews living between the Jordan Valley and Mediterranean, according to the CBS.
Jewish settlements in occupied territory Palestinians seek for a state have also dimmed Palestinian hopes of a viable and contiguous country of their own with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Palestinians also fear their quest for statehood suffered another blow when U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December.
SETTLERS DISPUTE DATA
Israeli settlers immediately disputed the population figures, citing one study that put the number of Palestinians in the West Bank at 1.8 million.
""The slanted publication about Arab demography in Judea, Samaria and the Jordan Valley relies on data from the Palestinian statistics bureau which are not true or accurate. They (Palestinians) have an interest in inflating the numbers,"" settler spokesman Yigal Dilmoni said.
But Ahmed Tibi, an Arab legislator in the Israeli parliament, described the figures as accurate and ""well known to us for a long time"".
Without the creation of a Palestinian state, Tibi said, Israel will be headed toward a ""one-state solution"" embracing either ""apartheid or an Arab-Palestinian prime minister"".
Ofer Shelah, a committee member from the opposition centrist Yesh Atid party, said it is clear the Jewish majority between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean is ""precarious"".
""From a demographic perspective, if Israel does not part with the Palestinians then there is real danger to realizing the Zionist dream of a Jewish and democratic Israel,"" Shelah told Reuters.
Sergio DellaPergola, a demographer and professor emeritus at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said one state taking in two nations was not viable.
""The answer is separation, the answer is manifestly separation. Two countries for two people, which of course has to be negotiated,"" said DellaPergola.

Underlying political dynamics, he said, are more important than exact population percentages.

Kuciak, 27, was killed with two shots in his chest and Martina Kusnirova, 27, died from being shot in the head last month at their home outside Bratislava, the prosecutor, who asked not to be identified, told reporters. 
Police found their bodies on Feb. 25 after relatives reported the couple had not been answering phones for days. 
No one has been charged with the murder so far and police and prosecutors have kept quiet on the investigation, which has included interviewing 200 people. 
""There were no signs of struggle and most likely nothing had been stolen, which suggests it was a contract killing,"" the prosecutor said.
""Kuciak worked on a number of stories. The police are pursuing several lines of investigation with equal attention.""
Kuciak had covered Slovak businessmen mentioned in the Panama Papers leaked file and also probed fraud cases involving businessmen with Slovak political ties. He had also been looking into suspected mafia links of Italians with businesses in Slovakia.
In his final report, published posthumously, he said one of the Italians had past business links with two Slovaks, who later worked in Prime Minister Fico's office. 
The Italian was briefly detained in the investigation with six others. He was detained on March 13 and placed in custody in an unrelated case of suspected drug trafficking. 
Both of Fico's aides have resigned but deny connections to the murder. Their Italian former business partner has denied having connections with the mafia and the murder.
The public outcry over the killings and Kuciak's reporting have led to the biggest protests since the 1989 end of communism, as tens of thousands have protested for a government shake-up or new elections.
Fico, after leading Slovakia in 10 out of the past 12 years, resigned this month. His existing three-party coalition has been reformed under new Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini, a long-time senior member of Fico's Smer party.
The new cabinet has already faced public protests as well.

Protesters see the reshuffle, which also saw former health minister Tomas Drucker replace unpopular interior minister Robert Kalinak, as insufficient to safeguard a fair investigation of Kuciak's murder. The ruling party Smer was often a target of the reporter's investigative journalism.

The United States and European countries have expressed concern about the electoral commission's plans to use 100,000 new electronic voting machines, saying the system is untested and could allow fraud. 
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley warned Congolese authorities last month to use paper ballots or lose American support for the polls.
Only a fraction of expected international contributions have been disbursed as donors await clarification from authorities about how the vote will be conducted, including whether the commission will follow through on the plans to use the machines. 
Government spokesman Lambert Mende said on Monday the donors' conditions amounted to meddling in Congo's sovereign affairs and urged them to direct their contributions to other sectors such as healthcare and education. 
""No country in the world accepts foreign interference in a process that is an exercise of sovereignty,"" Mende told Reuters.
The presidential election - now scheduled for December 23 - has been repeatedly delayed since Joseph Kabila refused to step down at the end of his mandate in 2016, with the government citing financial constraints as a main reason. 
Uncertainty about Kabila's future, including whether he plans to change the constitution to remove term limits that bar him from standing for a third elected term, have sparked violent street demonstrations in which dozens of people have died. 
The United Nations has asked international donors to contribute $123 million to support presidential, legislative and local elections over the next two years, whose total cost is expected to run to more than $1 billion. 
Mende said the government's decision to reject such aid was prompted in part by an upturn in government revenues from its mining sector, which has left more money to finance the polls. 
Congo is the world's biggest source of cobalt and Africa's top copper producer. Mining sector revenue rose nearly 36 percent last year and oil and gas sector revenue doubled.

Election commission president Corneille Nangaa told Reuters on Monday he was aware of the government's decision but had no further comment.

Abortion has long been a divisive issue in once stridently Catholic Ireland, where a complete ban was lifted only in 2013 when terminations were allowed in cases where the mother's life was in danger.
Voters are due to decide whether they wish to repeal the section of Ireland's constitution that was inserted in 1983 and enshrined the equal right to life of the mother and her unborn child, and to instead enable parliament to set the laws.
While not on the ballot paper, the government is drafting legislation in line with the recommendations of an all-party parliamentary committee, which called for terminations with no restrictions to be allowed up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy.
However, with Ireland's two largest parties allowing members a free vote on the legislation, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar cannot guarantee voters that his minority government will be able to introduce access up to 12 weeks, a measure he supports.
Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said just last month that while he backed the referendum proposal, he could not support the planned legislation, complicating a process that was already set to face a battle in parliament.
Writing in Monday's Irish Independent newspaper, Coveney said his thinking had shifted on the issue and that he would support the proposal due to be brought before cabinet on Tuesday, provided it is coupled with strict medical guidelines.
""In recent weeks the Health Minister and senior clinicians have worked with me on the safeguards and structures to the proposed law that I hope will enable those unsure to vote Yes,"" Coveney wrote.
Ireland's parliament is currently finalizing the process to allow the referendum to be held before the end of May.
A Sunday Business Post/Red C poll showed that voters who support repealing the eighth amendment of the constitution had dropped to 56 percent from 60 percent two months ago, while 26 percent said they would not support it and 18 percent either refused to answer or remain undecided.
A slightly lower 52 percent of voters back the government's legislative proposals, compared to 33 percent against.

The first sign of the race tightening suggested campaigners in favor of overhauling one of the world's strictest abortion laws have a real fight on their hands to maintain their lead, according to Richard Colwell, chief executive of Red C.

449,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",Italy's League leader says ready for coalition talks with 5-Star,"By Crispian Balmer
ROME (Reuters) - The head of Italy's far-right League said on Monday he was ready to talk to the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement about forming a government after the two sides joined forces to elect parliamentary speakers at the weekend.
Saturday's vote, which saw a 5-Star politician take charge of the lower chamber while a center-right veteran became head of the upper house Senate, raised speculation the two blocs might move on and try to forge a coalition.
Such a prospect looked near impossible a month ago, with the League and its conservative allies deeply opposed to the 5-Star both in terms of policies and personalities.
However, after a March 4 national election ended in a hung parliament, Italy's disparate parties are considering various options to overcome the impasse as President Sergio Mattarella prepares to start formal negotiations next week.
""We need to sit around a table with everyone, and certainly also with 5-Star,"" League leader Matteo Salvini told Il Messaggero newspaper in an interview.
In an interview with Telelombardia, Salvini said he would put forward 10 priorities for the next government, including reforming the justice system, curbing immigration and dumping a recent pension reform that had pushed back retirement ages.
He made no mention of introducing a flat tax - a campaign pledge that would cost billions of euros to implement and is seen as incompatible with an expensive, flagship 5-Star proposal to instigate a ""citizens' wage"" to help the poor and jobless.
Luigi Di Maio, leader of the 5-Star, laid out his own policy priorities on Sunday, highlighting the need to undo the recent pension changes and reduce youth unemployment. He made no reference to the citizens' wage.
BETRAYAL
Sending another mollifying signal, Salvini said he was ready to drop his claim to be the next prime minister, even though the League emerged as the largest party within the conservative alliance, which in turn is now the largest bloc in parliament.
""It is not 'Salvini or death',"" he told Telelombardia.
The 5-Star and League have enough seats to govern alone - a prospect that has worried financial markets because of their shared hostility to European Union budget restraints and their big campaign spending pledges.
However, Salvini has always pledged not to abandon his rightist allies, including former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose Forza Italia party unexpectedly trailed the League in this month's vote, leaving him to play second fiddle.
Berlusconi last week accused Salvini of betraying him in the vote for the speakers. Although the two subsequently made peace, Forza Italia veterans are afraid the League might ditch them and join the 5-Star in a coalition with a limited, but popular program that would prepare the way for swift, new elections.
A poll last week showed support for Forza Italia crumbling as center-right voters jumped on the League band wagon.
""Berlusconi is tired, angry and worried,"" said a senior Forza Italia politician, who declined to be named.
In an interview with the daily Corriere della Sera on Monday, the 81-year-old Berlusconi said Salvini needed his allies to govern, adding that a 5-Star/League government would be a ""hircocervus"" - a half-goat, half-stag mythical creature.

""(It was) often mentioned by ancient philosophers as an example of absurdity because it is made up of opposed and irreconcilable characters,"" he said.

450,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>","In face of Ghouta defeat, Syrian rebels blame each other","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian rebel factions are blaming each other for opening the way to their defeat near Damascus, underlining splits that plagued the armed uprising against President Bashar al-Assad since its earliest days.
The rivalry between the factions of eastern Ghouta - Failaq al-Rahman and Jaish al-Islam - had led to the effective partition of the enclave since 2016 and fueled bouts of deadly violence that played to the government's advantage.
Their rivalry has at some points mirrored tensions between their regional sponsors: Saudi Arabia, which has backed Jaish al-Islam, and Qatar, which supported Failaq al-Rahman.
With the help of Russian air strikes, the army has waged one of the most ferocious offensives of the war to recapture eastern Ghouta, killing more than 1,600 people since Feb. 18 according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Still, in media comments late on Sunday, the groups laid blame on each other for speeding up the government's advances.
The Jaish al-Islam military spokesman, in an interview with al-Hadath TV, said Failaq al-Rahman had rejected a proposal to mount a shared defense of Ghouta and accused it of cutting water supplies needed to fill defensive trenches.
""These trenches dried up which sped up the regime's advances,"" said Hamza Birqdar, the spokesman.
The Failaq al-Rahman spokesman told the same TV station that Jaish al-Islam had staged a weak defense of the enclave, which advancing government forces split into three separate pockets.
""Failaq al-Rahman was stabbed in the back ... via the frontlines that Jaish al-Islam was supposed to be at,"" said Wael Olwan, Failaq al-Rahman's Istanbul-based spokesman.
A Syrian official said the ""conflict between the terrorist groups"" in eastern Ghouta was one of the factors that had helped the military ""achieve what it has achieved in a short space of time"".
It echoes a pattern at other key moments in the seven-year-long war: rebels blamed each other as government forces and Iran-backed Shi'ite militias thrust into opposition parts of eastern Aleppo, won back by Assad in 2016. 
Thousands of Failaq al-Rahman fighters, accompanied by their families, are leaving their zone of eastern Ghouta in a negotiated withdrawal to insurgent territory in northern Syria. 
Jaish al-Islam says it is holding out in its part of the enclave in the eastern Ghouta town of Douma. Assad's Russian allies said on Monday that Jaish al-Islam fighters were also ready to lay down their arms and leave, which the group denied.
Rebels who have left eastern Ghouta so far have gone to Idlib, an insurgent-held region at the Turkish border. Idlib has also been blighted by fighting between the dominant faction - fighters formerly affiliated to al Qaeda - and other rebels.
The fragmented state of the anti-Assad armed opposition has been seen as one of its critical weaknesses since the start of the conflict, which the UK-based Observatory says has killed half a million people since 2011.
Russian and Iranian military backing for Assad has also far outstripped support that had been offered to rebel groups from foreign states including Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United States.

In addition to their foothold in the northwest, anti-Assad rebels still hold a chunk of territory at the frontier with Jordan and Israel, and small enclaves near Damascus, Homs and Hama.

KIEV (Reuters) - A Washington-backed body set up to vet judges in Ukraine as part of the battle against corruption quit its role on Monday, saying the process to screen a judge fit for office was a sham.
The row spotlights Ukraine's troubled efforts to tackle corruption, including in the judiciary, which it needs to do to qualify for more aid from the International Monetary Fund which supports Kiev with a $17.5 billion bailout package.
According to mandatory public wealth declarations, many judges own property, luxury cars or cash which far exceeds their stated income. 
The Public Integrity Council (PIC), set up in 2016 and supported by the USAID which provides technical expertise and support, has worked with the High Qualification Commission of Judges in ensuring around 6,000 judges are qualified and not involved in corrupt practices.
""All our attempts to set up cooperation with these bodies were a complete fiasco,"" said Halyna Chyzhyk, a member of the Council, which is made up of lawyers, activists and journalists. 
""The reasons for PIC's decision to leave ... are the steps taken which only confirm their (the commission's) real intentions not to clean up the judicial system but preserve the old order and rules,"" she said at a news conference.
""PIC will not participate in this process,"" Chyzhyk said. 
The Council said the commission was simply going through the motions while vetting judges. Only 0.2 percent of judges have failed an exam which is meant to prove they are qualified, while interviews to determine their honesty lasted 3-6 minutes. 
The Commission in a later press conference said the Council had not followed correct procedure, leaving the vetting process vulnerable to legal challenges further down the road. 
""We will continue to ask for information from the PIC,"" said Stanislav Shchotka, Secretary of the Qualification Chamber of the Commission. ""We would like our colleagues to help us and not be things for the Commission to trip up on.""
Corruption has plagued Ukraine's judicial system for years and deters investment the country needs to grow an economy scarred by a separatist insurgency in the Donbass region and a prolonged standoff with Russia. 
The U.S. embassy did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

BEIJING (Reuters) - North Korea leader Kim Jong Un has visited China, Bloomberg reported on Monday citing three unnamed sources, in what would be his first known overseas trip since taking power in 2011 and ahead of a potential summit with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Details of his visit including its purpose and itinerary were not yet known, Bloomberg said. Japanese media reported earlier on Monday that a high-ranking Pyongyang official appeared to have arrived by train in Beijing.
Kyodo, citing sources close to the matter, said the visit of the official was intended to improve ties between Beijing and Pyongyang that have been frayed by North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons and China's backing of tough sanctions against North Korea at the United Nations Security Council.
The visit could not immediately be confirmed by Reuters. 
Footage from Nippon News Network, owned by Nippon TV, showed what an announcer described as a green train carriage with yellow horizontal lines, part of a 21-car train, similar to the kind that Kim's late father, Kim Jong Il, rode when he visited Beijing in 2011.
Beijing has traditionally been the closest ally of secretive and isolated North Korea. But Kim is due to hold summit meetings separately with China's rivals, South Korea and the United States.
""Such a visit would reflect China's effort to get back in the game,"" said Scott Snyder, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank. ""Xi would not tolerate being third in line to meet Kim.""
Asked earlier at a daily news briefing about reports of an important North Korean visitor arriving at the Chinese border city of Dandong, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she was unaware of the situation.
Nobody answered the telephone at the North Korean embassy in Beijing on Monday evening.
""The government is closely communicating with relevant countries and monitoring the situation,"" South Korea's presidential Blue House said in a statement via a messaging app earlier on Monday.
Asked about the report that Kim was in China, White House spokesman Raj Shah told reporters on Monday: ""We can't confirm those reports. We don't know if they're necessarily true."" 
Kyodo, citing sources, reported that on Sunday, a special train that might have carried the official passed through Dandong. Two sources in northeastern China also told Reuters that a North Korean visitor had crossed into Dandong by train.
The rail journey between Dandong and Beijing covers more than 1,100 km (680 miles). It takes at least 14 hours by ordinary service, according to Chinese railway timetables.
HEAVY SECURITY
On Chinese social media some residents of Dandong said there had been high security around the train station there and said there were rumors that Kim was passing through.
Police tightened security along Beijing's main east-west thoroughfare, Changan Avenue, mid-afternoon Monday, closing off the entrances to some of the buildings which face the road.
Police also cleared out all tourists from Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) around the same time, which normally only happens when important meetings are happening in the Great Hall of the People, where top Chinese leaders often meet visiting heads of state.
There was a large security presence outside the Great Hall on Monday evening. Reuters reporters saw a lengthy motorcade, including a limousine with dark tinted windows, heading down Changan Avenue in the direction of the Diaoyutai State Guest House and away from the Great Hall of the People, flanked by a police escort on motor-bikes. 
Also on Monday evening, the Beijing railway bureau warned on its microblog, without giving a reason, of multiple train delays of up to two hours in the Beijing region.
A source with ties to the Chinese military told Reuters that it was ""not possible to rule out the possibility"" that Kim was visiting Beijing, but cautioned this was not confirmed.
A diplomatic source told Reuters that there was heavy security around the Diaoyutai State Guest House, where some high level foreign visitors stay during visits to the city. Other diplomatic sources said they were aware of the speculation that Kim was visiting but were not able to immediately confirm it. 
Visits to China by Kim Jong Il were only confirmed by both China and North Korea once he had left the country. 
Kim Jong Il traveled by private train during his rare visits to China or Russia under tight security. Diplomats and other sources have said Kim Jong Il avoided flying for overseas trips due to security concerns.

The younger Kim, who was educated in Switzerland, is not known to have any fear of flying and state media have shown pictures of him aboard a plane. However, he is not known to have traveled outside the country since assuming power in late 2011 after his father's death.

GENEVA (Reuters) - North Korea said on Monday its policy of seeking better ties with the South was enjoying broad international support, and called on the United States to halt its sanctions and pressure.
Ri Jong Hyok, director of North Korea's National Reunification Institute and deputy head of its Supreme People's Assembly, said that his country sought to build a ""just and peaceful new world, free from aggression and war"". 
Nothing could block the goal of inter-Korean dialogue and reunification, he told the general assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) in Geneva. North Korea's efforts to improve bilateral ties with South Korea now enjoyed a ""broad spectrum of support"" internationally, he said. 
""Now is the high time to put an end to the U.S. anachronistic anti-DPRK hostile policy and its futile moves of sanctions and pressure,"" Ri said, referring to his country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
North Korea's consistent position was to resolve all issues through dialogue and negotiation, he said.
""The United States should properly understand our position and come out in a manner of sincere and serious attitude for positively contributing to maintaining peace and stability on the Korean peninsula,"" Ri added.
U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in May after South Korean officials relayed a message from Pyongyang that the North Korean leader wished to speak to Trump about denuclearization.
The detente with the North began in January with the announcement that Pyongyang would send athletes to compete in the Winter Olympics held in the South, as part in a unified Korean team. It came after a year in which Pyongyang staged several missile launches and its biggest-ever nuclear test, in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions.
South Korea said on Saturday that North Korea had agreed to hold high-level talks with South Korea on March 29 at the border truce village of Panmunjom to prepare for a summit of their leaders planned for April.
Ri, who held bilateral meetings with parliamentary delegations from Syria and Mongolia in Geneva, made no reference in his six-minute speech to either upcoming summit.

CAIRO (Reuters) - When Abdel Fattah al-Sisi announced he was standing for Egypt's highest office four years ago he said it would be his last day in uniform, a pledge which symbolized his transition from military chief to president.
But last month, with Monday's election approaching, Sisi was back in army fatigues when he visited a military base towards the end of a first presidential term that rights groups say has been marred by an unprecedented crackdown on dissent.
Sisi was opening an anti-terrorism center in the Sinai peninsula, where he has told the army to use ""all brute force necessary"" to defeat an Islamic State insurgency which threatens the stability he promised to deliver.
The rare appearance in uniform, which Sisi has worn a handful of times since taking office, was a reminder not just of his military background but also the central role of the army and security forces under his leadership.
""I'm ready to put on military uniform and go out and fight side by side (with you),"" he told a conference in Cairo this month commemorating soldiers killed in conflict.
To his critics, the 63-year-old former intelligence general has led Egypt deeper into authoritarianism than even former president Hosni Mubarak, who was toppled in 2011 after ruling for three decades under a state of emergency.
Rights groups say Sisi has muzzled political opponents, activists and critical media, while courts have passed death sentences on hundreds of supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood since he deposed the Brotherhood's president, Mohammed Mursi, after mass protests in 2013.
Tough economic reforms, backed by the IMF, have halved the value of the pound and hit millions of poor Egyptians.
Sisi's supporters say the measures are needed to keep the country stable as it recovers from political chaos and tackles grave economic challenges and the Islamist insurgency.
Ahead of this week's election, in which no credible challenger has been able to stand, Sisi warned last month that anyone who threatened Egypt's stability would be dealt with harshly.
""I will die before anyone messes with its security,"" he said, adding that the 2011 uprising, when the army stood by while Mubarak was forced out, would not be repeated.
""Be warned. What happened seven or eight years ago will not happen again in Egypt,"" Sisi told an audience that included his own defense minister. ""It seems you don't know me well enough.""
""I'm not a politician who just talks"".
MILITARY RULERS
Sisi is the latest in a line of Egyptian rulers drawn from the military that was only briefly broken by Mursi, who lasted a year before Sisi overthrew him.
Promising to work for ""security, stability and development"" after three years of turmoil, Sisi sought to project a new dynamism when he took office - holding cabinet meetings at 7 a.m. and joining a cycle race on his first weekend as president.
The message was clear. The sclerotic, 30-year rule of former president Mubarak and the turbulence of Mursi's brief presidency were over. The new president would get things done.
In another break with the Mubarak presidency, Sisi has kept his wife and four children out of the spotlight to avoid suggestions he may have ambitions to build a political dynasty.
He has promised to abide by a two-term constitutional limit for serving presidents, a pledge which if honored would be a first in Egypt's modern history. His five predecessors were either pushed out, died in office or were assassinated.
""Building the state takes 16 to 20 years, I am trying to finish it in eight years, God willing,"" Sisi said in November.
SISI'S GOAL
Born on Nov. 19, 1954, Sisi showed signs of unusual discipline as a young boy, people in his old neighborhood in Cairo said. While other boys played football or smoked, Sisi and his friends lifted weights made of metal pipes and rocks. 
""Abdel Fattah always seemed to have a goal. He had willpower,"" said Atif al-Zaabalawi, a dye worker who used to see Sisi in the capital's Gamaliya district.
Neighbors say he came from a tightly knit religious family. A cousin, Fathi al-Sisi, who runs a handicraft shop, said the future field marshal had memorized the Koran. His father encouraged him to work in his shop every day after school. 
He lived in a small apartment on the rooftop of a run-down building owned by his extended family. Although it was a relatively well-off family, Sisi has sought to emphasize his connection with the struggles of ordinary Egyptians. 
""I lived for 10 years with nothing in the fridge except water ... and I am from a wealthy family,"" he told a youth conference in Sharm el-Sheikh two years ago.
That remark was one of several which Sisi's critics have mocked. His call for people to donate one pound a day to a development fund via their mobile phones, or a suggestion that banks divert ""loose change"" from transactions to the fund, were widely ridiculed. 
Sisi kept a low profile as Mubarak's head of military intelligence, and became the youngest member of the military council that ruled Egypt for 18 months after Mubarak resigned in February, 2011.
Mursi appointed him army chief and defense minister in August 2012, mistakenly calculating that the military would let the Brotherhood pursue its Islamist agenda as long as its own entrenched privileges were kept safe.
Sisi captured little international attention until he appeared on television on July 3, 2013, to announce the removal of Mursi after vast crowds demanded he resign, and to promise a new election which Sisi won by a landslide the following year.
Lacking the flamboyance or rhetorical skills of former presidents Gamal Abdel Nasser and Anwar Sadat, Sisi projects a calm and softly spoken persona and speaks only occasionally in public.
But pictures of Sisi are ubiquitous across Egypt and he has not publicly sought to limit the torrents of praise for him in state media.
In an unpublished segment of an interview with al Masry al-Youm daily that was leaked in an audio online ahead of his first term, he spoke of a vision that suggested he was destined to be a great leader.

""In a dream I had 35 years ago, I was raising a sword with the phrase 'There is no God but God' written on it in red,"" he said. In another dream he met Sadat and told him: ""I know that I will be president"".

MUMBAI (Reuters) - A social media furor over data privacy on Indian political party apps escalated on Monday with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and opposition Indian National Congress trading barbs.
The row comes at a time of heightened sensitivity worldwide after the alleged misuse of personal data amid the unfolding Facebook-Cambridge Analytica controversy 
Allegations that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's official mobile app was sending personal user data to a third party without consent caused an online uproar over the weekend.
Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party denied the allegations and said the data was being used only for analytics to offer the ""most contextual content"".
The BJP in turn took aim at the Congress on Monday after the same security researcher highlighted that the opposition party's app was transmitting personal data of those that signed up in an unsecured format. 
The Congress later appeared to have deleted the link to its app entirely on Monday, prompting Amit Malviya, the head of the BJP's IT cell, to tweet, ""What is the Congress party trying to hide?""
The Congress responded on Twitter saying it was forced to remove the app as an incorrect link was being circulated and people were being misled. 
The security researcher, who has previously highlighted some vulnerabilities in India's national identity card project and who tweets under the pseudonym Elliot Alderson, caused a flurry on Saturday with a series of tweets saying the Modi app was sending personal user data to a third-party domain that was traced to an American company.
""Hi! My name is Narendra Modi. I am India's Prime Minister. When you sign up for my official App, I give all your data to my friends in American companies,"" wrote opposition Congress Party Chief Rahul Gandhi in a Twitter message on Sunday.
The BJP responded on Twitter, saying Gandhi was trying to divert attention. The BJP has accused the Congress of engaging Cambridge Analytica in India, a charge the opposition party has denied.
Alderson, who initially pointed out that the Modi app was sharing data with a third party without the consent of users, earlier on Sunday posted a new tweet saying the app had ""quietly"" updated its privacy policy after his previous tweets.
Reuters could not independently verify Alderson's claims.

Modi has not commented on the issue.

Around 65,000 failed asylum seekers were granted temporary permission to stay in the country in 2017 because they could not be repatriated due to their lack of identity papers, a ministry spokesman said, up from 38,000 in 2016.
Germany has been trying to speed up such repatriations since Anis Amri, a Tunisian awaiting deportation, killed 12 people at a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016. Amri's deportation had been delayed because he had no valid passport.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision in 2015 to welcome more than a million migrants has provoked a popular backlash and increased support for the far-right Alternative for Germany party.
Migration policy was one of the most disputed issues for Merkel's conservatives and the center-left Social Democrats in renewing their coalition this month.
The number of people who applied for asylum fell in 2017, however, coming in well below the maximum 220,000 agreed on by the coalition parties.
The largest numbers of failed applicants who could not be repatriated because they had no papers were from India (5,743), Pakistan (4,943), Afghanistan (3,915) and Russia (3,828), publishing group Funke Mediengruppe reported, citing an interior ministry internal report. 
The nationalities of nearly 3,800 applicants were registered as ""unclear"", including people such as Palestinians and Kurds who did not have a country to which they could be deported, the report said.
Cooperation between German authorities and the embassies of the countries of origin of failed applicants, to issue substitute passports, was going poorly in many cases, the report said.
Earlier this month, Europe's top migration official, Dimitris Avramopoulos, said the European Union wanted to tighten visa requirements for applicants from countries that were not cooperating enough on migrant deportations.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Yanis Varoufakis, Greece's former finance minister who transfixed Europe with his unconventional style at the climax of the debt crisis, launched a new party on Monday promising to free his country from debt bondage.
The academic economist - who once described the austerity imposed by Greece's creditors as ""fiscal waterboarding"" - said his new MeRA25 party would revive the economy through debt restructuring and other measures.
Varoufakis' regular criticism of euro zone policy and his anti-austerity stance angered Greece's creditors and brought the country to the brink of a euro exit in 2015 before he resigned.
He won a measure of celebrity through his combative stance, though there have been no recent polls to test whether that will be enough to take his party past the 3-percent threshold to enter parliament.
Greece was living as a ""debtors' colony"", which would eventually lead to its ""desertification"", Varoufakis told reporters at a central Athens theatre, his black shirt still untucked.
He said the debt-strapped country had suffered a quadruple bankruptcy - a bankrupt state with bankrupt banks and households and nonviable businesses ""where everyone owes to everybody else but no one can pay.""
""Our young people learned to live on 400 euros a month or look to emigrate. We will not repatriate them with debt relief alone as (the creditors) are promising us,"" he said. ""Once your human capital has left, you are bereft.""
RESTRUCTURING
Varoufakis, the ""communist in a Burberry scarf"" as EU officials once called him, said his party's plan would involve a debt restructuring - swapping outstanding Greek government bonds with new ones where yields will be linked to economic growth.
It would also cut the budget's primary surplus target to not more than 1.5 percent of GDP from an agreed 3.5 percent until 2022.
The recipe would also include a public company to manage bad loans along with a moratorium on property foreclosures, cuts in VAT tax to 18 from 24 percent and lowering corporate tax to 20-26 percent from 29 percent currently.
Varoufakis deflected questions from reporters about whether his combative stance during the debt crisis had cost Greece billions of euros.
""In 2015 creditors strangled Greece, refusing to negotiate in good faith and engineered a bank run,"" he said, adding that in August, when the country is set to exit its latest bailout, its debt colony status risks becoming permanent.

MeRA25 is a play on the Greek word for 'day' - echoing the name of his EU reform campaign group DiEM25, which evoked the Latin phrase ""carpe diem"" or ""seize the day"".

RIYADH/SANAA (Reuters) - The Houthi movement that controls northern Yemen vowed on Monday to fire more missiles into Saudi Arabia unless it stops bombing the country, after one of its missiles caused casualties in the Saudi capital for the first time.
The Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis accused them of using Iranian-made missiles. Spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said the coalition reserved the right to respond to Iran ""at the appropriate time and manner"", under international law and within the framework of the United Nations, to protect Saudi Arabia.
The incident threatens to sharply escalate a war that has already unleashed what the United Nations considers the world's most urgent humanitarian crisis. Millions of Yemenis live under threat of mass starvation and disease, at the mercy of combatants who have sometimes cut off food and medical supplies.
Saudi forces said they shot down three missiles over Riyadh shortly before midnight. Debris fell on a home in the capital, killing an Egyptian man and wounding two others.
Air defences also repelled missiles fired at the southern Saudi cities of Najran, Jizan and Khamis Mushait, the coalition said.
The attacks stripped away the sense of calm in Riyadh, a city which until recent months had never quite felt at war.
A Houthi leader hailed the attack, which took place as Yemen marked the third anniversary of the start of the war.
""We praise the successful advance of military capabilities,"" Houthi political council chief Saleh al-Samad told tens of thousands of supporters in the Yemeni capital Sanaa.
""If they want peace, as we have said to them before, stop your air strikes and we will stop our missiles,"" he said. ""If you continue your air strikes, we have a right to defend ourselves by all means available.""
The war pits a coalition of Sunni Arab states friendly to the West against the Houthis, a Shi'ite armed movement sympathetic to Iran.
The Houthis, who deny they are Iranian pawns and say their movement is a national revolution against corruption, control the north of Yemen, including the capital Sanaa. 
Saudi Arabia and its allies have been fighting on behalf of an exiled government with a foothold in the south.
DANGEROUS ESCALATION
Al-Malki accused Iran of providing the Houthis with ballistic capabilities and said the international community must ""work together to combat this dangerous escalation"" which threatened security in the region and beyond.
At a press event in Riyadh, he displayed what he said were the remnants of a missile fired into Riyadh alongside an Iranian-manufactured Sayyad 2 missile he said had been part of a seized shipment on its way to Houthi fighters in Yemen.
Independent U.N. experts reported to the Security Council in January that Houthi missiles they had examined and other military equipment had been manufactured in Iran.
Last year, when the Houthis fired missiles at Riyadh which were intercepted, the Arab coalition responded by shutting Yemen's airports and ports. The United Nations said that blockade raised the prospect of mass starvation before it was partially lifted.
Thousands of air strikes on Yemen, some of which have hit hospitals, schools and markets, killing hundreds of civilians, have brought the coalition little closer to military victory.
Saudi Arabia has said hundreds of its own soldiers and civilians have been killed in Houthi mortar and short-range missile attacks across their rugged southern border.
The United Nations says 10,000 people have died in the war, and three out of four Yemenis -- 22 million civilians -- need relief aid. More than 1 million cholera cases have been reported, the worst outbreak in modern history.
Western countries have urged Saudi Arabia and its Gulf Arab allies to protect civilians and find a quick end to the war. But they also support Riyadh's argument that it needs to defend itself from cross border strikes and limit the spread of Iranian influence in territory overlooking important trade routes.
The U.S. Pentagon blamed Iran for exacerbating the conflict.
""This follows Iran's pattern of providing advanced weapons to the Houthis,"" spokeswoman Lieutenant Commander Rebecca Rebarich said in a statement. ""Iran has enabled the conflict in Yemen to spill into neighbouring countries and undermines international efforts to resolve the conflict, exacerbating the suffering of the Yemeni people.""
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, appearing to refer to Iran, said in a statement that the transfer of missile capabilities to non-state actors that may be used against states is ""irresponsible and contrary to law"".
Anwar Gargash, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, a Saudi military ally, tweeted: ""The message of the Houthi-Iranian missiles is clear. There's no coexisting with a terrorist militia which threatens the stability of our region and is a proxy of Tehran."" 
Qatar, which has been under months of sanctions from Arab countries including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, also condemned the attacks on Saudi cities as ""a violation of international law"".
The Saudi military depends on service contracts with Western arms companies to keep its planes flying. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman discussed the war in recent visits to U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May.

Diplomats and Yemeni political officials reported this month that the Houthis and Saudi Arabia were conducting secret peace talks after years of U.N.-mediated dialogue yielded no results.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Jewish groups were planning a street protest outside parliament on Monday against opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, accusing him of failing to tackle anti-Semitism in party ranks because of a far-left world view hostile to Jews.
Since unexpectedly becoming Labour leader in 2015 after decades spent on the left-wing fringes of the party, Corbyn has repeatedly faced accusations of turning a blind eye to anti-Semitism in the party and among groups he supports.
""He is repeatedly found alongside people with blatantly anti-Semitic views, but claims never to hear or read them. Again and again, Jeremy Corbyn has sided with anti-Semites rather than Jews,"" the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Jewish Leadership Council said in an open letter late on Sunday.
Corbyn said in a statement he recognized anti-Semitism had occurred ""in pockets within the Labour Party"" and apologized for the pain this had caused. He condemned anti-Semitism and vowed to stamp it out of Labour politics.
The issue flared up again last week after it came to light that in 2012 Corbyn questioned a decision by London local authorities to remove a street mural depicting men in suits with big noses playing Monopoly on the backs of naked people.
Corbyn said on Friday he had spoken out at the time against the removal of public art on grounds of freedom of speech, but regretted not looking more closely at the image, which he now said was ""deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic"".
In their open letter, the Jewish groups accused Corbyn of issuing ""empty statements"" while doing nothing to understand or tackle anti-Semitism. They said he was the figurehead of an anti-Semitic culture based on conspiracy theories and obsessive hatred of Israel.
""We conclude that he cannot seriously contemplate anti-Semitism, because he is so ideologically fixed within a far-left worldview that is instinctively hostile to mainstream Jewish communities,"" they said.
Several Labour members of parliament said they would join the protest on Monday, exposing internal divisions within Labour that had been papered over after Corbyn led the party to a stronger-than-expected showing in a general election last June.
Corbyn won the Labour leadership thanks to fervent support from many grassroots members who rejected the centrist approach of predecessors such as former Prime Minister Tony Blair, but many Labour lawmakers have been uncomfortable with his leadership.
The mural issue, like several similar controversies in the past, appeared not to dent Corbyn's support among dedicated grassroots followers who saw it as the latest attempt by establishment figures to smear and undermine him.
Some of them posted supportive messages on Twitter under the hashtag #PredictTheNextCorbynSmear.
Stephen Pollard, editor of the Jewish Chronicle newspaper, posted in response: ""I'll have a go. It will be an accurate quote of something Corbyn has said.""

Stanislaw Zaryn, spokesman for the minister responsible for the secret services, told state broadcaster TVP Info that the man had been detained on Friday, and that a court had approved his detention the following day for up to three months.
The official, who has been identified only as Marek W., held a position responsible for energy projects and was providing the Russians with information on how Warsaw intended to block the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, Zaryn said.
Poland opposes the construction of Nord Stream 2, which would connect Russia to Germany through a pipeline across the sea and allow Moscow to pump more gas to its main markets in Western Europe while bypassing states further east.
Warsaw says the pipeline would strengthen Gazprom's dominant position on the gas market in central and eastern Europe, limit competition and increase Europe's dependence on Russian gas.
Polish state news agency PAP said the suspect had been in contact with Russian intelligence officers working under diplomatic cover at the Russian embassy in Warsaw.
The case comes as Britain and the European Union have clashed with Moscow, accusing Russia of being involved in the poisoning of a former Russian double agent in England. 
The Russian ambassadors to Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were summoned to the foreign ministries of those countries on Monday, Russian news agencies reported.
The Russian ambassador in Poland declined to comment on the reason for the meeting at the Polish foreign ministry.

463,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 09:39AM ET</span>","Remove barriers to membership talks, Turkey tells EU before summit","By Alissa de Carbonnel and Tuvan Gumrukcu
ANKARA/VARNA, Bulgaria (Reuters) - Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan said he will seek the removal at a summit with the EU on Monday of all obstacles to a stalled membership bid, which the bloc however believes are of Ankara's own making.
Criticism from European Union governments of what many view as Erdogan's growing authoritarianism at home and his intervention in Syria's war has created an uneasy backdrop to the gathering in the Black Sea port of Varna.
Some countries had called for an end to long-stalled accession talks and had hesitated to agree to meet him.
But Erdogan said it was time for the EU to ""keep its promises"" to Turkey, which started formal membership negotiations in 2005 that stalled five years and have now effectively collapsed.
""EU membership continues to be our strategic goal,"" Erdogan told reporters before departing for the summit. ""In today's EU summit, we will convey our expectations about the lifting of the obstacles our country has faced.""
Erdogan, who has alarmed the West with a massive purge since a failed coup attempt in July 2016, remains an important ally in the U.S.-led NATO alliance and the fight against Islamic militants, and the destination for many Syrians fleeing war.
Turkey shares a border with Iraq, Syria and with Russia in the Black Sea, and the EU is its biggest foreign investor and trading partner.
CASH ONLY 
EU leaders are likely to provide Erdogan with 3 billion euros ($3.7 billion) in fresh cash to extend a 2016 deal on Turkey taking in Syrian refugees.
They will go no further than that, as Brussels considers the EU membership bid a separate process focused on rule of law, press freedoms and economic reforms.
But Erdogan on Monday appeared to conflate the two.
""Our country has fulfilled all responsibilities as part of the 2016 migrant deal, but the EU has not shown the same sincerity in keeping its promises and still does not do so,"" Erdogan said.
""In terms of counter-terrorism, we will convey that we expect unconditional support and cooperation from the EU.""
EU officials say Turkey's post-coup crackdown on civil rights has taken it further from complying with EU membership criteria.
""The differences in views between the EU and Turkey are many,"" said European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who will represent the bloc along with European Council President Donald Tusk. 
""(Varna)...will be a frank and open debate, where we will not hide our differences but will seek to improve our cooperation,"" Juncker said after a two-day EU summit that condemned what they said were Turkey's illegal actions in a standoff over Mediterranean gas with Greece and Cyprus.
DIALOGUE OR CONDEMNATION?
Turkey's EU membership process is not formally frozen, but talks have not taken place for over a year. 
Host Bulgaria, which also shares a border with Turkey holds the EU's rotating presidency, is eager to keep ties as positive as possible.
""The meeting in Varna is likely to be one of the last opportunities to maintain dialogue,"" Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said.

Meanwhile Chancellor Sebastian Kurz of Austria, the country the most opposed to Turkey's EU membership aspirations, called in an interview in Die Welt newspaper for the EU to condemn Ankara for escalating the seven-year-long war in Syria.

467,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 03:55PM ET</span>",Puigdemont arrest leaves Catalan independence movement on the ropes,"By Angus Berwick and Michael Nienaber
MADRID/BERLIN (Reuters) - A German court said on Monday it was likely to take several days to decide whether to extradite former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont to Spain to face rebellion charges over the region's campaign for independence.
But despite a night of protests across Catalonia in which dozens of people were hurt in clashes with police, Puigdemont's arrest on Sunday in northern Germany leaves the independence movement weaker than it has been in years. Almost its entire leadership is now either behind bars ahead of trial or in exile.
Puigdemont, who fled Spain five months ago for Belgium after Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dismissed his regional administration and imposed direct rule from Madrid, faces charges of rebellion that could lead to 25 years in prison. 
On Sunday night, a demonstration in Barcelona against Puigdemont's arrest by tens of thousands of Catalans tipped over into clashes with police.
Outside the central government offices, riot police beat flag-waving protesters back with batons, leaving several with blood streaming down their foreheads.
About 100 people were hurt across the region, including 23 members of the Mossos d'Escuadra police force, and nine people were arrested, authorities said.
The protests followed a Spanish Supreme Court ruling on Friday that 25 Catalan leaders, including Puigdemont, would be tried for rebellion, embezzlement or disobeying the state relating to a referendum held in Catalonia last October that called for it to separate from Spain.
The Madrid government deemed the referendum, which was widely boycotted by opponents of independence, illegal and took over direct rule of the wealthy northeastern region following a symbolic declaration of independence by the Catalan parliament.
The court on Friday also reactivated international arrest warrants for four other politicians who went into self-imposed exile last year. Puigdemont and fellow separatists have all denied any wrongdoing.
Five separatist leaders, including the latest candidate to become regional president, Jordi Turull, were ordered jailed pending their trial. The Catalan parliament's failure last week to vote in Turull as president started a two-month countdown to elect a new leader before a regional election is triggered.
The forceful action by the government and courts appeared to be bringing a close to what had been one of Spain's worst political crises since the return of democracy in the 1970s.
""Looks like the separatist movement is falling apart,"" Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Adrian Zunzunegui said in a note on Monday. ""We expect a few more months of uncertainty, and most likely new elections to be called then.""
Another election could swing the government either way, with separatist sympathies still simmering across Catalonia, though polls have shown support sharply down in recent months.
On Monday, the Catalan parliament, where pro-independence parties hold a majority, called a session for Wednesday in support of Puigdemont.
The proposal includes a debate over Puigdemont's right to be invested as regional head of the Catalan government. Spain's Constitutional Court has already said he could only become regional leader if he was physically present in the parliament and had a judge's permission to attend.
""FALLING APART""
Puigdemont appeared on Monday before a regional court in the northern German town of Neumuenster, which extended his detention pending a decision on extradition.
Another court, the Higher Regional Court in the town of Schleswig, will be responsible for deciding whether to grant Spain's request. The court is unlikely to make a final decision on Puigdemont's extradition before Easter, a spokeswoman for the state prosecutor said.
Puigdemont, who has been living in Brussels since leaving Spain, does not plan to apply for political asylum in Germany, his lawyer Jaume Alonso-Cuevillas told Catalan radio.
He had entered Germany from Denmark on Friday after leaving Finland, where he had attended a conference and was caught off-guard by the Spanish Supreme Court's unexpected decision to reactivate his arrest warrant.
The 55-year-old former journalist is unlikely to find much support among German politicians who have largely backed Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's crackdown on Catalan separatism.
A German government spokesman said on Monday the case was being handled according to German laws and European arrest warrant provisions, and that the Catalan question could only be resolved within the framework of Spanish law.
Elmar Brok, a German member of the European Parliament and ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, said Puigdemont had ""clearly violated Spanish law and the Spanish constitution"".
European governments, some of whom face separatist movements of their own, have generally been supportive of the Spanish government.
The Scottish government, which advocates independence from the United Kingdom, said it would co-operate with Madrid over a request to extradite former Catalan education minister Clara Ponsati, although it still believed Catalans had the right to self-determination.
Ponsati's lawyer said on Monday she would contest her extradition and called it ""political persecution"".
The drawn-out crisis has also hit Catalonia's economy and caused a business flight. But rating agency Standard & Poor's last Friday upgraded its rating for Spain, reflecting a positive outlook for the economy and limited impact from Catalonia.

Spanish bond yields were at close to 15-month lows on Monday morning.

Shanghai residents who hold foreign passports or settle abroad are required to cancel their Shanghai hukou and a tweak to that policy due to take effect in May empowered police to revoke the hukou of anyone who refused.
A vestige of the planned economy, the hukou system assigns each Chinese citizen a jurisdiction of residence that determines their access to education and other social welfare services.
Hukou registrations can be hard to change and the system has been a lightning rod for controversy in a free-wheeling economy powered by mass internal migration. Critics say it disadvantages the hundreds of millions of people from rural areas who work in cities but don't have residency status.
The Shanghai Public Security Bureau said on Sunday online that because implementation rules had not been enacted and the precise meaning of ""establishing residency abroad"" remained undefined, it would refrain from enforcing the policy.
""At this stage, Shanghai public security organs will not cancel the hukou of people who have established residency abroad,"" it said.
The Global Times newspaper reported last week that the new rule was introduced to counter a rise in dual nationality, which China does not recognize.
Hukou in major cities like Shanghai and Beijing are coveted by outsiders and jealously defended by locals.
""It's not like we aren't paying taxes in China. Why should we be condemned by the public for holding a green card?"" said one person on the popular Weibo microblog.
Another said: ""As long as they haven't taken foreign citizenship, green card holders are still Chinese citizens, so why should they be forced to give up their hukou?""
But some painted those able to gain foreign residence but hoping to keep their Shanghai hukou as wanting to have their cake and eat it.
""Green card holders are two-faced,"" said a user with the name Xiaoshen5911.

""The point of having both the green card and Shanghai hukou is to help them escape the rule of law. Our country should not only cancel their Chinese hukou, but also freeze their bank account to prevent them from moving their money abroad.""

Rights groups have denounced President Rodrigo Duterte's bloody war on drugs in which thousands of people have been killed, either by police or by shadowy, unidentified gunmen.
Duterte, who says he must be tough to protect the people from the scourge of drugs, has criticized rights groups saying they were ""trivializing"" his campaign and unjustly blaming the authorities for bloodshed.
Drug lords have suffered huge financial losses since the campaign was unleashed 20 months ago and drug syndicates were trying to destabilize the government, the president's spokesman, Harry Roque, said in a statement.
""We therefore do not discount the possibility that some human rights groups have become unwitting tools of drug lords to hinder the strides made,"" Roque said, without naming any rights group.
Roque said attacks on the president's war on drugs had been ""vicious and non-stop"", echoing comments by Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano last week after he defended the policy at a U.N. human rights council meeting in Geneva.
Roque did not offer any evidence to support the suggestion that rights groups were being used by drug lords.
The anti-narcotics campaign has raised international alarm and drawn criticism from some U.N. representatives, including High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, who suggested recently that Duterte needed to see a psychiatrist.
Police say they have killed more than 4,200 drug suspects who were violently resisting arrest since the launch of the crackdown, which Duterte has vowed to pursue until he steps down in June 2022. 
Several thousand more people have been killed by unidentified gunmen. Police suspect many were victims of gang wars though activists believe vigilantes supporting the government campaign were responsible for many of the killings.
Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch, criticized Roque's statement, and the earlier comment from Cayetano, as ""shockingly dangerous and shameful"".
""Are they trying to have death squads target human rights activists?"" Adams asked in a statement. 
""Cayetano and Roque provide no evidence. They should withdraw their comments immediately.""
Presidential legal counsel Salvador Panelo said the Human Rights Watch's call for Cayetano and Roque to withdraw their statements was ""misplaced"".
Duterte said on March 14 the Philippines would pull out of the International Criminal Court more than a month after court prosecutors opened a preliminary inquiry into his drug war.

Panelo said Duterte felt the ICC had become ""a tool of oppression, a tool of harassment"".

SEOUL (Reuters) - Described as North Korea's ""biggest hit of the year,"" next month's Pyongyang Marathon is expected to have half as many foreign participants as last year, tour operators say, as political tensions and a ban on U.S. visitors take their toll.
International tourism to North Korea dropped last year as tension increased over the county's testing and development of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions.
In July last year, the United States banned its citizens from visiting North Korea after the death of Otto Warmbier, an American university student who died after being released from 17 months of detention in North Korean.
""Tourism came close to collapse, there were far fewer tourists,"" said Simon Cockerell, general manager of Koryo Tours, noting that the market was small and easily susceptible to swings.
Tourism numbers have slowly risen amid an easing in those tensions over the past few months - driven by a revival of inter-Korean talks and a push for a summit between Pyongyang and Washington - but that hasn't translated to a major turnout for the year's biggest tourism event, operators said.
""Our tourist numbers for our scheduled group tours to North Korea have steadily grown. However, the amount of attendees to this year's Pyongyang marathon event are down considerately,"" said Rowan Beard, a manager with Young Pioneer Tours, who noted one of the biggest reasons for the drop is a lack of Americans. 
""The majority of the runners who had joined us previously were Americans,"" he said, describing the marathon as ""the biggest hit"" of last year. ""They were really keen to come to Pyongyang, compete against the locals and check out the country they constantly saw in the news back home.""
Last year saw an unusually large number of foreign runners, with around 1,000 participating, while this year around 500 are expected, Cockerell said.
""The marathon, the biggest event that draws tourists at the moment, is less than half the size it was last year,"" he said.
The American travel ban remains in place for all except a few categories of humanitarian workers and journalists, and in January the U.S. State Department began warning Americans who travel to North Korea or other risky countries to draft a will and discuss their funeral wishes with family members before leaving.
North Korea's National Tourism Administration launched a revamped tourism website last week, promoting a range of sightseeing and travel itineraries, according to NK News, a website that monitors North Korea.
Cockerell said he was convinced that tourism could help reduce tensions.

""Honestly I think Americans visiting in jeans and t-shirts can do more than Americans in full combat gear,"" he said.

Human Rights Council resolution brought by Beijing that it said sought to glorify Chinese President Xi Jinping's ""win-win"" agenda.
The United States cast the only ""no"" vote in at the council meeting in Geneva, with a U.S. diplomat saying Chinese officials were clear about their intent ""to glorify their head of state by inserting his thoughts into the international human rights lexicon"".
China led a resolution at the council - its second-ever in nearly 12 years - that calls for ""mutually beneficial cooperation"".
Australia, Britain, Japan, and Switzerland were among those abstaining, though many envoys spoke against the text.
The spat adds to tensions between Beijing and Washington which are locked in a trade dispute after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans for tariffs on up to $60 billion in Chinese goods.
""I think the comments by this U.S. official in Geneva you mention were extremely unreasonable, and also reflects the consistent ignorance and haughtiness of the U.S. side,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily news briefing.
Many countries expressed at the meeting that the Chinese resolution reflected the common wishes of the international community and helped raise the ability of developing nations to speak for themselves on human rights issues, Hua added.
Xi has overseen a clampdown on all forms of dissent in Chinese society, which has seen hundreds of rights lawyers and activists detained and dozens jailed.

China routinely denies accusations of rights abuses, saying its critics are prejudiced, that China is a country with rule of law and that it only goes after those who break the law.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants to repeal a Japanese law requiring broadcasters to show impartiality, a step critics fear will lead to sensational reporting and polarize views, just as a similar move has been blamed for doing in the United States.
Abe's government has drafted changes to Japan's broadcast law and plans to include them in reform proposals as early as May, laying the groundwork for future legislation, three government sources told Reuters.
The sources, who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the draft includes repealing the law's article 4, which requires license holders to show contrasting political views and is considered Japan's version of the U.S. Fairness Doctrine.
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission decided to repeal the doctrine in 1987 after criticism that it restricted broadcasters' freedom. The move, finalised in 2011, is widely credited with helping give rise to politically charged radio talk shows and news programs. 
""Without having these safeguards, media outlets become more susceptible to market forces,"" said Victor Pickard, associate professor of communication at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. ""The U.S. could serve as a cautionary tale.""
SUPPORT FOR ABE FALLING 
Abe has said he wants to overhaul the broadcast law to put traditional television channels on equal footing with online media, which are not restricted by article 4. The law does not apply to print media.
In a parliament session in February, he cited his appearance on AbemaTV, a livestreaming service operated by Internet advertising agency CyberAgent and TV Asahi that despite its name has no financial or other links to Abe. During his appearance, he was allowed to air his views without the need for contrasting views to be presented.
""As the division between traditional and digital media become meaningless, we should make for bold revisions to broadcast businesses to make the best use of airwaves, which are a public asset,"" Abe said.
But critics see it as a more sinister move, saying Abe wants to stack airwaves with pro-government messaging to bolster his popularity and push through a controversial revision of Japan's pacifist constitution. He is facing pressure over a suspected cover-up of a cronyism scandal, which could dash his hopes of winning a third three-year term in a leadership election in September.
""What Prime Minister Abe wants to do is to advertise his views,"" said lawmaker Soichiro Okuno from the opposition Party of Hope.
Television is still a popular and trusted medium in Japan; there is one public broadcaster, NHK. Government data shows the average household spends 168 minutes watching TV per week day, compared with less than 100 minutes online and 10 minutes reading newspapers. 
The same survey showed that 70 percent of people believed information in newspapers to be trustworthy, and 66 percent rated television trustworthy. Around 34 percent thought the Internet was a credible source of information.   
FAIRNESS DOCTRINE
Conservative politicians have used the broadcast law in recent years to criticize television broadcasters as biased against them.
Sanae Takaichi, a member of Abe's conservative Liberal Democratic Party and former minister of internal affairs and communications, said in 2016 that television stations could be shut down if they repeatedly showed political bias. 
Reporters Without Borders has criticized Abe's government for passing a tough secrecy act that critics have said could muzzle media. Japan ranks number 72 in its World Press Freedom Index, behind Malawi and Hungary. 
The resignation of some high-profile news readers known for taking a critical look at Abe's policies in recent years has raised speculation that broadcasters were bowing to pressure from politicians.
""We have a bit of a twisted situation... You have a government that's saying, 'Here's more freedom, let's do away with this restriction,'"" said Kozo Nagata, who teaches media and sociology studies at Musashi University. 
""But you cannot just tweak article 4 without understanding the history behind the law,"" he said, referring to its original aim of preventing media from being used as a propaganda machine.
Most broadcasters have opposed the move.

""Now that dealing with 'fake news' is becoming a common social issue all around the world, the role of media in providing balanced information is greater than ever,"" said Hiroshi Inoue, chairman of The Japan Commercial Broadcasters Association and honorary chairman of TBS Holdings, which owns a major commercial TV channel.

The Kremlin has denied any involvement and says Britain is orchestrating an anti-Russia campaign. 
During a visit to Estonia, Williamson said the backing for Britain was in ""itself a defeat for President Putin"".
""The world's patience is rather wearing thin with President Putin and his actions, and the fact that right across the NATO alliance, right across the European Union, nations have stood up in support of the United Kingdom ... I actually think that is the very best response that we could have,"" he told reporters.
""Their (the Kremlin's) intention, their aim is to divide and what we are seeing is the world uniting behind the British stance and that in itself is a great victory and sends an exceptionally powerful message to the Kremlin and President Putin.""
European Union member states agreed on Friday to take additional punitive measures against Russia over the attack on Skripal, found slumped on a bench with his daughter in the southern English city of Salisbury.
U.S. President Donald Trump is also considering the expulsion of some Russian diplomats, a source familiar with the situation said on Sunday.
Williamson also said he was surprised and disappointed by reports about European Union proposals to freeze Britain out of the Galileo satellite navigation project as part of negotiations over Britain's exit from the bloc next year.
The Financial Times newspaper reported that the EU was looking to lock Britain's space industry out of the 10 billion euro program to protect its security after Britain leaves the bloc next year.
""The United Kingdom has been absolutely clear that we do not want to bring the defense and security of Europe into part of the negotiations because we think it is absolutely vital,"" Williamson said.

""So I very mush hope that the European Union commission will take the opportunity to see sense, re-calibrate its position and not play politics on something that is so vitally important which is European defense and security.""

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptians voted on Monday in a presidential election set to deliver an easy win for incumbent Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, with turnout the main focus after all serious opposition withdrew complaining of repression.
Sisi has urged Egyptians to vote, hinting that he sees the election as a referendum on his rule rather than a serious democratic contest. Polling stations will be open for three days in an apparent effort to garner as many votes as possible for him.
Many Egyptians, as well as the country's Arab and Western allies including Washington, see Sisi as vital to stability as unrest since 2011 has hurt the economy. However, his critics say he has presided over Egypt's worst crackdown on dissent and describe the vote as a charade.
Sisi, 63, faces only one challenger who is a long-time supporter of the president.
The former general, who led the military's overthrow of Egypt's first democratically-elected president Mohamed Mursi in 2013, is trying to defeat Islamist insurgents in the Sinai Peninsula and complete a series of mega-projects inaugurated with great fanfare since he came to power.
Authorities have ramped up nationalist rhetoric and painted participation in the election as helping the fight against Islamists and other unspecified enemies. The state-run al-Gomhouria newspaper's front page on Monday read: ""Your vote is a bullet in the heart of your enemy.""
A lower-than-expected turnout could suggest Sisi lacks a mandate to take more of the tough steps needed to revive the economy, which struggled after the 2011 revolution drove away tourists and foreign investors, both sources of hard currency.
In early hours of the voting, witnesses said turnout was slow but on a normal business day most Egyptians are expected to vote after working hours. Reuters reporters saw buses bringing voters to polling stations and transporting Sisi supporters who chanted outside.
Those who voted early on Monday praised Sisi for ousting Islamists from power five years ago, saying otherwise Egypt would have suffered the same fate as some other Arab nations at the hands of extremists.
""If it weren't for Sisi, Egypt would have become like Iraq, Yemen, Syria - they would have destroyed the country,"" said 72-year-old Fayez Amin, who voted in the upscale Cairo neighborhood of Zamalek.
Tight security was enforced, with police and soldiers deployed at polling stations a day after a bomb attack that targeted a security chief in the northern city of Alexandria.
TIMELINE: Egyptian since Arab Spring uprisings
MEGA PROJECTS AND AUSTERITY
In Zamalek and Heliopolis, districts with strong support for Sisi and the military, nationalist songs blared out and groups of men waved Egyptian flags as they cheered and danced. A child sang the anthem of an Egyptian special forces unit. 
Dozens of people queued before polls opened, but only trickled in afterwards.
One of the few young voters at a Heliopolis polling station, Zeina Sherif, 20, said: ""Sisi is working on projects that we should give him a chance to finish.""
These projects include an expansion of the Suez Canal and a new capital being built east of Cairo. These will in time improve the economy and people's lives, Sisi says.
But critics say austerity measures have hurt his popularity, including a currency devaluation tied to an International Monetary Fund loan which left most Egyptians worse off. Many see little benefit from large projects and the harsh fiscal reforms.
Rights groups accuse Sisi of muzzling opponents, activists and independent media. Courts have sentenced hundreds of supporters of Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood to death since 2013.
The president's sole challenger is Moussa Mostafa Moussa, a Sisi supporter widely seen as a dummy candidate. Moussa has said he hopes Sisi beats him but rejects charges he is being used to present a false sense of competition.
Some voters disagreed. ""There's no real competition or diversity of choice,"" a 42-year-old man in Alexandria said, without giving his name for fear of reprisal by authorities. 
MUZZLING OF OPPOSITION
West of Cairo, a young woman who also declined to give her name, said: ""This is not a democratic exercise. We don't have any freedom of choice, or freedom of expression.""
Several politicians called for a boycott of the vote weeks ago after all major opposition campaigns withdrew, saying repression had cleared the field of credible challengers.
Sisi's top opponent, former military chief of staff Sami Anan, was arrested and halted his presidential bid after the army accused him of running for office without permission. 
Sisi has said he will not seek a third term, but critics expect him to remove a two-presidential term limit.

He won nearly 97 percent of the vote in 2014, but less than half of eligible Egyptians voted, even though the election was extended to three days.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A Chinese film festival has pulled award-winging gay romance ""Call Me By Your Name"" from its program, the movie's distributor said on Monday, reflecting China's mottled relationship with gay themes in the creative arts.
The movie, which won a screenplay Oscar this month, was withdrawn from the Beijing International Film Festival set for April, Sony Pictures Entertainment told Reuters, declining to comment on the reason.
Homosexuality is not illegal in China, but activists say conservative attitudes in some sections of society have led to occasional government clamp-downs.
In July last year, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) conference in the western city of Chengdu was called off after the venue canceled the booking citing conflicting events. Lesbian dating app Rela was also shut down last May.
A blacklist of banned audiovisual online content last year also controversially included homosexuality, underlining a long-standing attitude in China towards same-sex relations despite often thriving gay scenes in major cities.
The pulling of ""Call Me By Your Name"" also comes as China tightens its grip on media content. Parliament this month voted to scrap term limits for President Xi Jinping and hand control over film, news and publishing to the Communist Party's publicity department.
The film follows the summer romance in Italy between a 17-year-old boy and an older student. It was pulled after the screening proposal submitted was not approved by regulators, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
In an initial screening list dated March 16, the organizer had listed ""Call Me By Your Name"" along with other foreign films like ""Lean on Pete"" and art parody ""The Square"".
The festival organizer declined to comment. Reuters couldn't reach China's State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television.
""This movie is in deviation from the policy environment in China,"" said Wu Jian, a Beijing-based film analyst, adding that it was ""quite embarrassing for China"" that it had been pulled.
China has long censored violence or sexual content in film releases, with a growing focus on socialist core values. Films with gay themes have met with a mixed reaction with some banned, though others have been given the go-ahead.
""There is no clear policy on this issue, so we are always confused,"" said Xin Ying, executive director of the Beijing LGBT Centre, adding that following the recent reshuffle of the media regulators it was getting even harder to get clear direction.

477,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 03:20AM ET</span>",Nearly half of Japanese think Abe should quit over land sale scandal: poll,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Nearly half of Japanese voters believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe should quit to take responsibility over a cronyism scandal and cover-up that have sent his support sliding, according to an opinion poll released on Monday.
Suspicions have arisen about a sale of state-owned land at a huge discount to a nationalist school operator with ties to Abe's wife, Akie, setting off the biggest political crisis Abe has faced since returning to power in 2012 and prompting protestors to call almost nightly for him to quit.
Abe has denied that either he or his wife intervened in the sale or were involved in altering documents related to the deal, in which mention of his and Akie's names were removed. 
According to a public opinion survey covered by the liberal Asahi newspaper at the weekend, 48 percent of those polled said Abe and his government should quit, compared to 39 percent who said that wasn't necessary.
Those who said they supported Abe slid to 32.6 percent, down 11.7 percentage points from a month ago, while those who said they did not rose 13.2 percentage points to 54.9 percent.
Asked why they supported him, the largest number - 37.8 percent - said it was because his government ""seems better than others,"" a reflection of the fragmented opposition and voter memories of the rocky tenure of the rival Democratic Party of Japan, one part of the reason Abe has managed to stay in power as long as he has.
No margin of error was given for the poll, in which 66.7 percent of 1,606 people contacted responded.
Asked about the land sale scandal in a parliamentary committee on Monday, Abe reiterated that as head of the government he was responsible for voters losing trust in his administration but repeated his denial that either he or his wife had been directly involved in the land sale.

478,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 05:07AM ET</span>",Taiwan scrambles jets as China's air force holds drill near island,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan sent aircraft on Monday to shadow China air force fighter jets as they flew through the Bashi Channel to the south of the island, its defense ministry said, the latest such incident to add to tension between Taipei and Beijing.
China sent an unspecified number of Xian H-6 bombers, Su-30 fighter jets and Y-8 transport aircraft over the waterway on their way to the West Pacific Ocean, the Taiwan ministry said.
They were followed by Taiwan jets until the mainland aircraft returned to base, it said in a statement.
Taiwan on March 21 sent ships and aircraft to shadow a Chinese aircraft carrier group that sailed through the narrow Taiwan Strait.
Taiwan is one of China's most sensitive issues and a potential military flashpoint.
The Chinese military movements come during a time of heightened tension between Beijing and the self-governed island and follows strong warnings by Chinese President Xi Jinping against Taiwan separatism.
China claims Taiwan as its own and considers the island a breakaway province. Xi said last week Taiwan would face the ""punishment of history"" for any attempt at separatism.
China's hostility towards Taiwan has grown since Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party won presidential elections on the island in 2016.
Meeting New Taipei City Mayor Eric Chu in Shanghai on Monday, the newly appointed head of China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office, Liu Jieyi, said China was clear in its opposition to Taiwan independence, Chinese state television said.
China hopes both sides of the Taiwan Strait can work together for the peaceful development of relations and ""jointly promote the process of the peaceful reunification of the motherland"", Liu told Chu, state television added.
The New Taipei City government said in a statement that Chu, from the China-friendly opposition Nationalist Party, told Liu they hoped for peaceful cooperation.
""Although the political situation has changed, what people hope for most is peace,"" said Chu, who Tsai defeated for the presidency two years ago.
While China insists it has no hostile intent, its military exercises and patrols around Taiwan, and in the busy South China Sea waterway, have touched a nerve in the region and in the United States.
U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Alex Wong angered Beijing during a recent visit to Taiwan by saying the U.S. commitment to the island had never been stronger.
Beijing is already furious about a law signed two weeks ago by U.S. President Donald Trump that encourages the United States to send senior officials to Taiwan to meet counterparts and vice versa.

480,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 03:02AM ET</span>",Israeli police question Netanyahu in telecom corruption case,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli police questioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday over his alleged dealings with the country's largest telecommunication company, Israel Radio said, in one of three corruption cases weighing on the leader's political future. 
It was the second time the prime minister had been questioned in the investigation. He is suspected of awarding regulatory favors to Bezeq Telecom Israel in return for favorable coverage on a news site the company's owner controls.
Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a witch hunt.
Israeli media said Netanyahu's wife and son would be questioned separately in the telecoms investigation over their relationship with Bezeq's owner and his spouse.
Video footage showed a police car pulling into the driveway of the prime minister's official residence in Jerusalem. A police spokesman and a lawyer for the Netanyahu family declined comment.
Bezeq has denied wrongdoing. Police have yet to make a recommendation about charges in the case. 
Two former Netanyahu confidants have agreed to turn state's witness in the case. One is Shlomo Filber, the former director general of the Communications Ministry,; the other is Nir Hefetz, a former spokesman of Netanyahu. 
In the two other cases in which police have already recommended that Netanyahu be charged with bribery, the final decision about whether to prosecute rests with the Israeli attorney general. That decision could be months away.
In the first investigation, known as Case 1000, he is suspected of bribery over gifts from wealthy businessmen, which police say were worth nearly $300,000. 
The other, Case 2000, involves an alleged plot to win positive coverage in Israel’s biggest newspaper by offering to take measures to curtail the circulation of a rival daily.
So far, partners in Netanyahu’s governing coalition have stood by him, saying they are awaiting the attorney general’s next moves. Political analysts say such support may erode if the investigations against Netanyahu intensify.
Netanyahu could also call a snap election to try to stall legal proceedings during the campaign and rally his right-wing power base behind him. Recent polls show Netanyahu’s Likud ahead of other factions in the Knesset.

However, surveys also show that about half of Israelis believe the police over Netanyahu and think he should step down. A third think he should remain in office.

Delfin Lorenzana, in a speech at a naval base south of the capital Manila, said the three Japanese donated second-hand TC90 planes will definitely boost the navy's capability to gather intelligence in the disputed South China Sea.
""We must admit that much still has to be done to boost our military capability equipment in order to meet a number of persistent maritime security challenges,"" Lorenzana said, identifying territorial disputes with China, and other countries, over resource-rich areas in the South China Sea.
China claims almost the entire South China Sea, where about $5 trillion worth of sea-borne goods pass every year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have conflicting claims in the strategic waterway.
Tensions between the Philippines and China over the disputed sea have eased since President Rodrigo Duterte came to power in July 2016 and improved relations with Beijing via Chinese trade and investments.
Lorenzana said the Philippines was also concerned with piracy and the movement of armed insurgents in the Sulu Sea and other transnational crimes, including smuggling of illegal drugs and poaching into rich fishing grounds in territorial waters.
Japan planned to lease five surveillance planes but decided last year to transfer without cost the aircraft after changes were made in Tokyo's self-defense forces law allowing donation of excess defense and military equipment to partner countries.
Japan's vice minister for defense, Tatsuo Fukuda, said Tokyo was willing to help its allies improve its capabilities help secure the safety of international sea lanes and benefit not only the Philippines but the entire region.
During the handover ceremony, Lorenzana and Fukuda watched the planes land at a naval base guarding the mouth of Manila Bay, hundreds of miles southeast of the disputed Scarborough Shoal now patrolled by Chinese coast guard ships.
The navy said the surveillance planes have a range of 300 km (186 miles), twice the capability of its existing aircraft and could patrol into China's seven artificial islands in the Spratly, which had been converted into military bases.
The navy said it has a budget of nearly 6 billion peso ($114.65 million) to acquire two brand new long-range maritime patrol aircraft to enhance its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capability.

482,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>",U.S. sanctions Pakistani companies over nuclear trade,"By Drazen Jorgic
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The United States has imposed sanctions on seven Pakistani companies over suspicion they have links to the nuclear trade, potentially hurting Pakistan's ambitions to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).
Pakistani government spokesmen could not be immediately reached for comment on Monday.
Relations between the United States and Pakistan have been strained in recent years over Pakistan's alleged support for Islamist militants waging war in Afghanistan, something Pakistani officials deny.
The U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security, Commerce imposed the sanctions on the Pakistani companies on March 22 by placing them on its ""Entity List"".
The companies had been ""determined by the U.S. government to be acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States"", the bureau said in a report on a U.S. government website.
The Department of Commerce's Entity List does not freeze assets but requires that U.S. and foreign companies doing business with those on the list first obtain a license.
Companies placed on the Entity List will need special licenses to do business in the United States.
None of the seven sanctioned Pakistani companies, which are not well known, could be immediately reached for comment, nor could a Singapore-based company which the bureau said was linked to one of the Pakistani companies.
Pakistani officials have in the past been accused of handing over nuclear secrets to North Korea. The government has denied the accusations though Pakistan has a poor record on nuclear proliferation.
The Pakistani scientist lionized as the father of Pakistan’s atomic bomb, Abdul Qadeer Khan, in 2004 said he had sold nuclear secrets to North Korea.
A U.N. nuclear watchdog said in 2008 that Khan's network smuggled nuclear weaponization blueprints to Iran, Libya and North Korea and was active in 12 countries.
SANCTIONED COMPANIES
Of the latest companies to be sanctioned, Singapore-based Mushko Logistics and Pakistan-based Mushko Electronics ""procured items for several Pakistani entities on the Entity List"", the U.S. bureau said in its report.
Another company, Solutions Engineering, ""has been involved in the procurement of U.S.-origin items on behalf of nuclear-related entities in Pakistan that are already listed on the Entity List"". 
Three of the companies - Akhtar & Munir, Proficient Engineers and Pervaiz Commercial Trading Co. (PCTC) - were on the list due to ""involvement in the proliferation of unsafeguarded nuclear activities that are contrary to the national security and/or foreign policy interests of the United States"".
Marine Systems was placed on the Entity list for helping other already-sanctioned bodies obtain items without a license, while Engineering and Commercial Services (ECS) was sanctioned for ""involvement in supplying a Pakistani nuclear-related entity on the Entity List"". 
The sanctions could deal a blow to Pakistan's application to join the NSG, a 48-nation club dedicated to curbing nuclear arms proliferation by controlling the export and re-transfer of materials that could foster nuclear weapons development.
Nuclear-armed Pakistan applied to join the NSG in 2016 but little progress has been made.
The United States has been concerned about Pakistan's development of new nuclear weapons systems, including small tactical nuclear weapons, and has been trying to persuade Islamabad to make a unilateral declaration of ""restraint"".

The bill was tabled ahead of a national election that is expected to be called within weeks and as Najib faces widespread criticism over the scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). 
Under the Anti-Fake News 2018 bill, anyone who published so-called fake news could face fines of up to 500,000 ringgit ($128,140), up to 10 years in jail, or both.
""The proposed Act seeks to safeguard the public against the proliferation of fake news whilst ensuring the right to freedom of speech and expression under the Federal Constitution is respected,"" it said. 
It defines fake news as ""news, information, data or reports which is or are wholly or partly false"" and includes features, visuals and audio recordings. 
The law, which covers digital publications and social media, also applies to offenders outside Malaysia, including foreigners, as long as Malaysia or a Malaysian citizen were affected.
The bill states it is hoped the public would be more responsible and cautious in sharing news and information.
Opposition lawmakers have questioned the need for such a law, arguing that the government already had broad powers over free speech and the media.
""This is an attack on the press and an attempt to instill fear among the rakyat (people) before GE14,"" opposition lawmaker Ong Kian Ming said on Twitter after the bill was tabled, using a Malaysian term for this year's election.
The 1MDB scandal, exposed by foreign media and news blogs in 2015, refuses to die down despite Najib's consistent denials of any wrongdoing and his government's firm grip on Malaysia's state-owned mainstream media.
Transactions related to 1MDB are under investigation in six countries including the United States, where the Department of Justice has launched civil cases to recover assets linked to the fund after investigations under an anti-kleptocracy initiative.
The Malaysian government has acted harshly against media reporting on 1MDB. It suspended one newspaper, The Edge, in 2015 and blocked other websites for publishing stories critical of Najib's role.
A deputy minister was quoted in Malaysian media last week as saying that any news on 1MDB that had not been verified by the government was ""fake"".

Governments elsewhere in Southeast Asia, including Singapore and the Philippines, have proposed laws aimed at clamping down on the spread of ""fake news"", moves decried by media rights advocates.

Pressure has been mounting on Macron to scale back military support for the two Gulf Arab states over concerns that French weapons are being used in the offensive, which marks its third year on Monday.
The two Gulf Arab states are leading a coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi group that controls most of northern Yemen and the capital Sanaa. The conflict has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced more than three million.
The poll showed that 88 percent of respondents believed their country should stop arms exports to all countries where there is a risk they could be used against civilian populations and specifically 75 percent for those operating in Yemen.
Seven in 10 people said the government should stop exporting weapons to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
""On the occasion of the third anniversary of Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, it is high time for the (French) government to hear this message,"" said Eoin Dubsky, campaign manager for the SumOfUs NGO, which commissioned the survey. 
""Emmanuel Macron, who presents himself to the world as a humanist president, must pass from words to deeds.""
The poll comes as some European states, notably Germany, have curtailed ties with the Saudi-led military coalition. France, Britain and the United States have not followed suit.
France is the world's third-biggest arms exporter and counts Saudi Arabia and the UAE among its biggest purchasers.
Unlike many of its allies, French export licensing procedures have no parliamentary checks or balances, making the system particularly opaque.
The poll showed that 69 percent of people wanted to see a strengthening of the role of the French parliament in controlling arms sales. 

The survey was conducted online between March 20-21 with a sample of 1,026 people from various strands of the French population aged 18 and over.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Before his shows at a jazz club in Bangkok, Pan Pan Narkprasert, 29, slathers layers of makeup on his face, emerging after two hours transformed into Pangina Heals, a larger-than-life, purple-lipped lady with a mass of blonde hair.
A professional drag queen, Pan Pan performs a weekly show at the 1930s Shanghai-inspired venue in this capital's Silom nightlife area.
""This is not the White House. We're just having fun here,"" Pangina tells the cheering audience.
""We make fun of everybody. If you feel offended, you know where the door is.""
Pan Pan is also co-host of ""Drag Race Thailand"", the first international edition of the U.S. reality television show ""RuPaul's Drag Race"", which pits drag queens against each other in various weekly challenges and runway performances to find ""America's next drag superstar"".
On the air for almost a decade, ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" is hosted by American drag queen, singer and TV personality RuPaul, and sees the last two contestants lip-sync to songs for a crown and other prizes in the final episode.
The Thai show, which follows the same format, has contestants aged 18 to 37 competing for a 500,000 baht ($16,000) cash prize.
""Drag Race Thailand"" made its debut last month and Pan Pan credits the show with helping Thailand's drag scene to blossom.
""The drag scene is growing so much more because of shows like 'Drag Race Thailand' and 'RuPaul's Drag Race',"" Pan Pan said.
""Thailand's drag scene is new and fresh because drag is a form of Western culture, but Thai people are really interested in it.""
A largely conservative Buddhist society, Thailand has nonetheless built a reputation as a place with a relaxed approach towards gender and sexual diversity.
Thailand's tourism authority promotes the country as a friendly destination for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) tourists and runs a website dedicated to the sector.
There are no official figures for the sexual orientation of visitors but travel industry executives say Thailand has seen an increase in the number of gay tourists.
Despite the relaxed attitude, and the prevalence of drag queens in the entertainment industry, their role has largely been confined to nightclubs.
Piyarat Kaljareuk, executive producer of ""Drag Race Thailand"", says he wants to bring drag queens out of the clubs and into a more prominent role in society as part of a greater acceptance of the drag scene and the LGBT community.
They are ""artists who don't yet have a platform for expression that is widely accepted,"" Piyarat said.
Fan favorite Assadayut Khunviseadpong, known as Natalia Pliacam in his drag persona, is one example. On the show, Natalia, 37, has wowed judges with her glittering costumes and flamboyant character, recently winning two out of three challenges in a single week.
Professionally, Assadayut has a more unassuming role running a business selling coffins in Bangkok's Chinatown. 
""Natalia is a role model for many other Chinese sons still living in the closet,"" Assadayut said.
LGBT activists say Thailand has a long way to go before gender and sexual equality is fully achieved.
Same-sex marriage is still not recognized, nor can people legally change their gender on national identification documents.
Piyarat hopes growing LGBT acceptance will result in legal recognition in the future.

""I don't want to say one show can change the world,"" he said, ""but I certainly hope to one day see equal rights and equal social opportunities.""

VARNA, Bulgaria (Reuters) - The European Union holds an uneasy summit with Turkey on Monday, when it is likely to provide Ankara with fresh cash to extend a deal on Syrian refugees but deflect Turkish demands for deeper trade ties and visa-free travel to Europe.
With the bloc critical of what it considers to be Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's growing authoritarianism at home and his intervention in Syria's war, Brussels had hesitated to agree to the summit.
But host Bulgaria viewed the meeting at the Black Sea port of Varna as a rare chance for dialogue with the country that remains a candidate for EU membership despite years of stalled talks. 
EU leaders also cited Turkey's importance as a NATO ally on Europe's southern flank and in curbing immigration to Europe from the Middle East and Africa. 
""I am looking with mixed feelings towards the Varna summit because the differences in views between the EU and Turkey are many,"" said European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who will represent the bloc along with European Council President Donald Tusk. 
""It will be a frank and open debate, where we will not hide our differences but will seek to improve our cooperation,"" Juncker told reporters on Friday after a two-day EU summit that discussed Turkey. 
At that meeting in Brussels, leaders condemned what they said were Turkey's illegal actions in a standoff over eastern Mediterranean gas reserves with bloc members Greece and Cyprus.
But in a familiar pattern of public recrimination, Turkey's minister for EU affairs, Omer Celik, said Ankara viewed the summit as ""an important opportunity to move our relations forward"" and that he expected ""the same positive and constructive approach from the EU"".
Erdogan will seek more money for Syrian refugees, a deeper customs union and progress in talks on letting Turks visit Europe without visas, a Turkish foreign ministry spokesman said.
'LAST CHANCE'
EU money is likely to be forthcoming, but little else, EU officials and diplomats said. 
The bloc is set to grant Turkey a second 3 billion euro ($3.7 billion) tranche to provide for the Syrians it hosts under a March 2016 deal to take in migrants fleeing the country's war.
However, EU diplomats said that Erdogan's invitation to Varna will come at the price of more sharp criticism from EU counterparts who say that Turkey has been backsliding on democracy and human rights since a failed coup in July 2016.
Some 50,000 people, including journalists, have been arrested while a further 150,000, including teachers, judges and soldiers, have been sacked or suspended from their jobs since the attempted coup.
""The meeting in Varna is likely to be one of the last opportunities to maintain dialogue,"" said Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, whose nation holds the EU's rotating presidency.
Despite the need for Turkey's cooperation on security and foreign policy, the EU should maintain a tough line, said Marc Pierini, a former EU ambassador to Turkey, now at the Carnegie Europe think-tank.

""It's quite tempting for EU politicians to go for a transactional relationship with Turkey, but Erdogan is not going to stop EU-bashing for his nationalist agenda,"" he Pierini.

Commentators said last week when Bolton was named that it signaled a toughening of Washington's stance on Tehran and another nail in the coffin of the Obama-era agreement between Iran and world powers to limit Tehran's nuclear ambitions, already cast into doubt by Trump himself.
""For a seemingly superpower country, it is shameful that its national security official would be receiving a salary from a terrorist sect,"" IRNA quoted Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, as saying.
Bolton has been a supporter of the exiled Mujahideen-e Khalq (People's Mujahideen) armed opposition group which Iran sees as terrorists, and has spoken at the group's events.
Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for Bolton, said on Sunday that Bolton ""doesn't respond to propaganda from a government long included on the United States' list of state sponsors of terrorism.""
There was no immediate comment from the White House.
In Paris, the group's spokesman Shahin Ghobadi said in response to the Iranian official's statement that ""the notion that the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran has funded ambassador Bolton or any other American officials is simply a lie and is a mere joke."" 
In a speech at an opposition group event near Paris in July, Bolton expressed hope that Iran's government would be toppled ""by 2019"".
Mujahideen-e Khalq, which earlier had bases in Iraq since the 1980s, began as a group of Islamist leftists opposed to Iran’s late Shah but fell out with Shi’ite Muslim clerics who took power after the 1979 revolution. 
It was one of the largest factions immediately after the revolution. But diplomats and analysts say it is difficult to determine the level of support for the group now inside Iran, where many Iranians cannot forgive it for siding with Saddam Hussein during Iran’s war with Iraq in the 1980s. 

The U.S. government designated the group a ""terrorist"" organization in 1997, but the designation was lifted in 2012.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is considering the expulsion of some Russian diplomats in the United States in solidarity with Britain over the poisoning of a former Russian spy in England, a source familiar with the situation said on Sunday.
The move may be contingent on how European capitals respond to the nerve agent attack, the source said.
An announcement of the U.S. decision could be made as early as Monday, the source said.
European Union member states agreed on Friday to take additional punitive measures against Russia for the nerve-agent attack on the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who have been critical in hospital since they were found unconscious on March 4 on a bench in the city of Salisbury.
White House spokesman Raj Shah said the United States is considering how to respond but would not provide details.
""The United States stands firmly with the United Kingdom in condemning Russia’s outrageous action. The President is always considering options to hold Russia accountable in response to its malign activities. We have no announcements at this time,"" he said.
Moscow has denied responsibility for the attack and has retaliated against Britain’s move to expel 23 Russians by ordering out the same number of Britons.
The United States joined with Britain in blaming Russia for the attack.

Trump has sought to improve ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and last week in a phone call with Putin congratulated him his disputed re-election victory.

489,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2018 05:40PM ET</span>","UK parliament must have power to stop 'No Deal' Brexit, says opposition Labour","LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's opposition Labour party will on Monday demand that parliament has the final say on the government's Brexit deal, including an option to send ministers back to the negotiating table rather than leave without an exit agreement.
After reaching a deal last week on a transitional period lasting until the end of 2020, Prime Minister Theresa May's team must now set about negotiating Britain's long-term trading arrangements with the European Union - perhaps the hardest stage yet in the complicated divorce talks.
The government has promised to put that final deal to parliament for approval, but has made clear the choice is either to accept the exit agreement, or leave without a deal. 
On Monday, Labour's Brexit policy chief Keir Starmer will call for a different approach.
""If Parliament rejects the prime minister's deal, that cannot give licence to her – or the extreme Brexiteers in her party – to allow the UK to crash out without an agreement. That would be the worst of all possible worlds,"" he will say in a speech in Birmingham.
A so-called 'No Deal' exit would be likely to cause upheaval on financial markets, throw cross-border trade into confusion, and spark a political crisis in the world's sixth largest economy.
Labour will seek to give parliament more options -- including a return to Brussels for fresh talks -- by amending the legislation that will formally end Britain's EU membership on March 29, 2019.
""Our amendment would make it clear that, should the prime minister's deal be defeated, it must be for parliament to say what happens next, not the executive,"" Starmer will say according to advance extracts of his speech.
The government argues that leaving open the possibility of more talks means that EU negotiators won't give Britain the best deal possible during the current negotiations. Any decision for more talks would also endanger an already tight exit timetable.
The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill has severely tested May's ability to rule the country with only a wafer thin majority in parliament.
In December she was defeated when 11 members of her party rebelled on a similar issue relating to the promise of a 'meaningful vote' of the final deal.
Labour has its own internal divisions on Brexit. These were exposed on Friday when Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn sacked his shadow Northern Ireland minister after he called for a second referendum on Brexit.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile shield was launched on Sunday against Palestinian machine gun fire originating in the Hamas-dominated Gaza Strip, and not against incoming militant rockets, the Israeli army said.
Flaming streams of about 10 Iron Dome rockets could be seen rising into the night sky in a spectacular light show, but there was no indication that Islamist militants in Gaza had fired rockets, a military spokeswoman said. 
A subsequent army statement said: ""Following reports of sirens sounding in southern Israel, unusual machine gun fire towards Israel was identified. No rocket launches were identified. The (military) is looking into the circumstances which led to the activation of the Iron Dome system.""
Abu Ubaida, spokesman of the Hamas armed wing, said no rockets were fired into Israel.
Earlier, Israeli media had reported that Iron Dome had intercepted a number of rockets fired from the Gaza Strip. Sirens had sounded around the border area in Israel and smart phone applications that warn of incoming rockets delivered a number of alerts in quick succession.
During the Gaza war in 2014, Iron Dome interceptors largely protected Israel's heartland from thousands of incoming rockets fired by Gaza militants. Israeli media said Sunday's multiple launchings were the most intense since then.
Heightening tension around the border, Hamas began a military exercise on Sunday in which its fighters set off explosions and test-fired rockets into the sea. Gunfire echoed across Gaza as hundreds of fighters were deployed for the exercise, which is due to continue on Monday.
""The enemy (Israel) bears responsibility for any escalation and we will not stand handcuffed against any aggression,"" Abu Ubaida said in a statement.
The army's statement said that, in response to the machine gun fire into Israel, a tank targeted two observation posts in the northern Gaza Strip. It said it held Hamas responsible ""for any terror emanating from the Gaza Strip"". 
Palestinian residents of Beit Hanoun said the tank fired two shells into their area at about the same time of the Iron Dome launches, but that there were no casualties.

While many Egyptians see the U.S.-allied former general, as vital to stability in a country where unrest since 2011 has hurt the economy, critics have dubbed the vote a charade after several credible candidates withdrew apparently under pressure.
Sisi, 63, who led the military's overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected President Mohamed Mursi in 2013, is seeking a second term after a first four-year mandate he says has brought stability and security.
But a lower-than-expected turnout could suggest Sisi lacks a mandate to take more of the tough steps needed to revive the economy, which struggled after the 2011 revolution drove away tourists and foreign investors, both sources of hard currency. 
Sisi's sole challenger in the March 26-28 vote is Moussa Mostafa Moussa, a longtime Sisi supporter widely dismissed as a dummy candidate: Moussa's Ghad party had actually endorsed Sisi for a second term before he emerged as a last-minute challenger.
Moussa dismisses accusations he is being used to present a false sense of competition, and the electoral commission says it will ensure the vote is fair and transparent.
An editorial in state-owned newspaper al-Ahram acknowledged the narrow choice for voters but suggested the mere holding of the ballot signaled Egypt was regaining its strength in the face of current domestic and foreign threats.
""The importance of presidential elections this time is not fierce competition or a real (electoral) battle, but a message to the world that Egypt is on its way through a recovery phase,"" it said.
MUZZLING OF OPPONENTS
Critics say Sisi's popularity since his 2014 election has been hurt by austerity reforms and a muzzling of opponents, activists and independent media. Courts have passed death sentences on hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood supporters since 2013.
Sisi's backers -- which include Western powers and most Gulf Arab dynasties -- say the measures are needed to keep the country stable as it recovers from political chaos and tackles an Islamist insurgency focused in the Sinai Peninsula.
Neither candidate has done much campaigning, appealing instead for a high turnout. Sisi won nearly 97 percent of the vote in 2014, but less than half of eligible Egyptians voted even though the election was extended to three days.
In remarks earlier this month that suggest Sisi may see the vote as a referendum on his performance, he said: ""If (all Egyptians) vote and a third say 'No', that would be a lot better than if half that number turn out and all of them say 'Yes'.""
Several opposition figures called for a boycott of the vote after all major opposition campaigns withdrew, saying repression had cleared the field of credible challengers.
ARRESTS 
Sisi's top opponent, former military chief of staff Sami Anan, was arrested and halted his presidential bid after the army accused him of running for office without permission.
Even before campaigning officially begun, the United Nations, rights groups and opposition figures criticized the run-up as compromised by arrests, intimidation of opponents and a nomination process stacked in favor of the incumbent.
The Civil Democratic Movement, an opposition political coalition, sharply criticized Sisi on Feb. 2 for a speech in which he warned off anyone seeking to challenge his rule and said the events of 2011, which toppled longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak, would never happen again.
The movement called the speech an attempt to spread fear that undermined the integrity of electoral competition.
In a letter to the Donald Trump administration's foreign policy team, the Working Group on Egypt, a bipartisan group of U.S. foreign policy specialists, said the ""sham election"" would take place against a backdrop of massive human rights abuses.
""We urge you not to treat this election as a legitimate expression of the Egyptian people's will and to withhold praise or congratulations,"" it said.

It said Sisi was expected to have his supporters in parliament propose amendments to the constitution to remove presidential term limits. Sisi has said he will not seek a third term in office.

Saudi forces destroyed three missiles over northeastern Riyadh shortly before midnight, as well as others fired at the southern cities of Najran, Jizan and Khamis Mushait, the coalition said in a statement carried by state news agency SPA.
Debris from the missiles fell on a home in Riyadh, killing an Egyptian resident and wounding two other Egyptians, said coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki, according to SPA.
Reuters reporters in Riyadh heard several booms and saw smoke in the air. Another witness said he saw a long stream of light followed by additional explosions.
In al-Malqa neighbourhood, emergency personnel gathered near a crater in the ground and inspected shattered glass in nearby homes.
The attack marked the third time in five months that missiles have flown over Riyadh, as the Houthis step up efforts to demonstrate they can reach the Saudi capital, and threatened to escalate a regional rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
The Houthi-run SABA news agency reported the group's missile force had targeted King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh with a Burkan H2 missile.
The group also fired other types of missiles at airports in Jizan, Najran and Abha, another southern Saudi city, according to the SABA report.
The Saudi-led coalition of Gulf Arab states launched military operations against the Houthis in Yemen in March 2015, after the Iran-aligned Shi'ite militia seized the Yemeni capital Sanaa and forced President Abd Rabbu Mansour al-Hadi to flee.
Riyadh saw the ouster as a regional power grab by arch-foe Iran, although the Houthis deny any help from Tehran, and has described Iran's alleged supply of rockets to the Houthis as ""direct military aggression.""
The United States, which provides support to the coalition, has also displayed what it said were Iranian-made weapons supplied to the Houthis, calling them conclusive evidence that Tehran was violating U.N. resolutions.
The conflict in Yemen has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced more than 2 million, unleashing a humanitarian crisis in the Arabian Peninsula's poorest country. Nearly 1 million people have been infected with cholera.
Coalition forces have made modest territorial gains over the course of the war but appear far from seizing back the capital.

After a month-long ground and air offensive and deals under which rebel fighters agreed to be transported to northern Syria, pro-Syrian government forces have taken control of most of what had been the last major rebel stronghold near the capital Damascus.
Only the town of Douma, the most populous part of eastern Ghouta, remains under rebel control. 
Jaish al-Islam is currently negotiating with Russia over the future of the area and the people in it. 
""Today the negotiations taking place ... are to stay in Ghouta and not to leave it,"" Jaish al-Islam's military spokesman Hamza Birqdar told Istanbul-based Syrian radio station Radio al-Kul via Skype from eastern Ghouta.
Birqdar accused the Syrian government of trying to change the demographic balance of the eastern Ghouta by forcing out locals and replacing them with its allies.
He said in the negotiations with Russia Jaish al-Islam is asking for guarantees that what remains of the local population will not be forced out. 
Both Ahrar al-Sham and Failq al-Rahman, two other rebel groups formerly in charge of pockets of the eastern Ghouta, have accepted deals under which they withdraw to opposition-held Idlib in northwest Syria.
Moscow and Damascus say the Ghouta campaign is necessary to halt deadly rebel shelling of the capital.

494,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>",Egypt says it deported British journalist for working illegally,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt said on Sunday it had deported a British journalist working for the Times newspaper last month because she was working illegally.
The Times said on Saturday its correspondent, 33-year-old Bel Trew, who had been based in Cairo for several years, was arrested while reporting on a migrant boat that had vanished two years ago, and forced to leave Egypt with no access to a lawyer.
The newspaper described an ""increasingly oppressive environment"" for media in Egypt ahead of a presidential election starting on Monday.
Egypt's State Information Service, which oversees the accreditation of foreign journalists, said in a statement Trew had been expelled partly because she had not applied for a temporary press card, saying this was a ""violation"". 
Trew had, however, applied for an annual card, which is required for foreign journalists to work in the country, SIS said.
Annual cards for all foreign journalists had been delayed this year due to ""technical circumstances"", it added.
Trew had successfully applied for an annual card for the last five years, SIS said, and criticized her reporting throughout that time as containing ""erroneous information"".
The Times did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Trew went to a Cairo district in February ""to practise journalistic work without permission"" and ""as a result of these two flagrant violations, the Egyptian relevant authorities took its decision to deport the British journalist,"" SIS said.
SIS criticized foreign media for reporting on Trew's expulsion without seeking government comment. 
Egypt's public prosecutor told state prosecutors last month to take legal action against media outlets found to be publishing false news, statements and rumors following strong official criticism of some foreign media coverage in Egypt.
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said this month any insult by a media organization of the army or police is defamation of the country and treason, rather than freedom of opinion.
Reuters sought comment on Saturday from SIS, the interior ministry, and Sisi's office before reporting Trew's deportation but calls and WhatsApp messages were not answered after several hours.
Trew said in an article in The Times she was detained by police in central Cairo after conducting an interview with ""a man whose nephew, a teenage migrant, had probably drowned at sea trying to get to Italy"" and held for hours then was ""marched onto a plane"" at Cairo airport bound for London.
Rights groups say authorities have cracked down on press freedom in the run-up to the March 26-28 presidential election.
Egyptian authorities have urged legal action against media outlets they deem to be publishing ""fake news"", and rights activists say several local journalists have also been arrested in recent months.
Egypt says its election will be free and fair and that clamping down on what it deems fake news is necessary for stability.

""We recognize that anti-Semitism has occurred in pockets within the Labour Party, causing pain and hurt to our Jewish community in the Labour Party and the rest of the country,"" Corbyn said in a statement posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""I am sincerely sorry for the pain which has been caused.""
Labour has faced persistent criticism in recent years for anti-Semitic comments made by party members and even lawmakers. Corbyn himself was criticized last week for a comment made in 2012 showing solidarity with the creator of a mural deemed by many to be anti-Semitic.
He responded on Friday by saying he wished he had looked at the contents of the mural more closely, and condemning it. But that apology fell short for some, with one Jewish lawmaker in his party describing it as ""wholly inadequate"".
The row, coupled with persistent ideological differences within Labour over Brexit, threatens to break the delicate truce Corbyn's left-wing leadership had earned from more centrist elements of his party after a stronger than expected performance in last summer's election. 
Before Corbyn's statement, Jewish community leaders had announced a protest outside parliament on Monday.
""He never sees or understands the anti-Semitism, whether it is from overseas terrorist groups or local Facebook groups,"" said a joint statement from two groups representing the community: The Jewish Leadership Council and The Board of Deputies of British Jews.
Corbyn's Sunday statement did not address the mural comments any further, but he said: ""Labour is an anti-racist party and I utterly condemn anti-Semitism, which is why as leader of the Labour Party I want to be clear that I will not tolerate any form of anti-Semitism that exists in and around our movement.""

Corbyn also said he would be meeting with Jewish representatives over the coming days.

Two policemen were killed in Egypt's second city on Saturday by a bomb that was left under a car and blew up as police Major General Mostafa al-Nemr drove past. He escaped unhurt.
""The interior ministry has dealt an effective blow to the armed wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Hasam movement, on the dawn of March 25. The ministry uncovered a terrorist den ... and exchanged fire with its elements which led to the killing of six,"" it said in a statement.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, which the state news agency blamed on the banned Muslim Brotherhood organization. Islamic State released a video last month in which it warned Egyptians against voting and urged Islamists to attack security forces and leaders.
Police identified three of those killed. The ministry said its investigations showed the same group had carried out Saturday's bombing. The ministry did not indicate if those killed on Sunday took part in the bombing.
The militant Hasam Movement emerged in 2016 and has claimed several attacks on security forces and judges, including the fatal shooting of a policeman. Egyptian authorities say the group is the Brotherhood's armed wing, but the Brotherhood says it rejects violence.

Egypt on Monday begins three days of voting in a presidential election which President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is widely expected to win.

Bio, who was briefly the head of a military junta in the 1990s, had been meant to face off against the ruling All People's Congress candidate, ex-foreign minister Samura Kamara, on Tuesday. 
However, a court on Saturday upheld a request for an injunction by an APC member who said there was evidence of electoral fraud that needed to be investigated before the poll could go ahead.
""This is a shame on this country that the ruling party is taking its own national institution to court and being destructive of the process that has already started,"" Bio told Reuters. ""I am not happy, I feel disappointed."" 
Voting in the March 7 first round was largely peaceful. 
President Ernest Bai Koroma's willingness to step down in a region where other leaders have sought to cling to power has been seen as a sign of how far Sierra Leone's democracy has come since a brutal 11-year civil war ended in 2002. 
But tensions over alleged fraud in some districts and complaints of police harassment against the electoral commission have marred the election process.
""The APC is afraid to go to the election knowing that they are going to lose. Definitely we will take an action. I will appeal to every Sierra Leonean to express our displeasure,"" Bio said, adding that supporters should respect the law.
Civil society organizations have also denounced the court decision and have called for the run-off poll to go ahead on Tuesday. 
It is unclear now when the vote will take place.

Whoever is eventually elected to replace Koroma will face the difficult task of reviving an economy hit hard by low prices for iron ore - once touted as the key to lifting the West African nation out of poverty - and a deadly Ebola outbreak.

The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) last week said it would seek to prosecute Zuma on 16 charges, including fraud, racketeering, corruption and money laundering.
Zuma could not be reached for comment on Sunday. He has repeatedly denied the allegations. A court appearance would be a dramatic development on a continent where former presidents rarely face their accusers in court.
""We are of the view everything will be finalised soon. Hopefully this week,"" Hawks spokesman Hangwani Mulaudzi told Reuters.
News24, citing sources close to the case, reported that Zuma would be summoned to appear in the Durban High Court on April 6. Mulaudzi declined to comment.
Zuma, who was forced to resign by his ruling African National Congress last month, was at the center of a 1990s deal to buy European military kit that has cast a shadow over politics in South Africa for years. 
Zuma was deputy president at the time of the arms deal. Schabir Shaikh, his former financial adviser, was found guilty and jailed in 2005 for trying to solicit bribes for Zuma from a French arms company. 
The 16 counts were filed against Zuma but then dropped by the NPA shortly before he successfully ran for president in 2009.

Since his election nine years ago, his opponents have fought a lengthy legal battle to have the charges reinstated. Zuma countered with his own legal challenges.

""We said we would go into Sinjar. Now operations have begun there. The fight is internal and external,"" Erdogan told a crowd in the Black Sea province of Trabzon, without elaborating on what operations he was referring to.
Iraq's Joint Operations Command denied that any foreign forces had crossed the border into Iraq. 
""The operations command confirmed that the situation in Nineveh, Sinjar and the border areas was under the control of Iraqi security forces and there is no reason for troops to cross the Iraqi border into those areas,"" it said in a statement.
Sources in Sinjar said there was no unusual military activity in the area on Sunday.
The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state for decades. President Tayyip Erdogan said last week they were creating a new base in Sinjar, and that Turkish forces would attack if necessary.
Sources in northern Iraq said on Friday the PKK would withdraw from Sinjar, where it gained a foothold in 2014 after coming to the aid of the Yazidi minority community, who were under attack by Islamic State militants.
The PKK, considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the European Union and the United States, has for decades been based in Iraq's Qandil mountain range, near the border with Iran.
Turkish troops and their rebel allies swept into northwest Syria's Afrin town this month, the culmination of an eight-week campaign to drive Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters from the region. Turkey sees the YPG as terrorists and an extension of the outlawed PKK.
Erdogan has vowed to extend the military operation along the Syrian border and on Sunday said the Turkish-led forces would take control of the town of Tel Rifaat.
Many civilians and YPG have gathered in and around Tel Rifaat after Turkey seized control of Afrin. It is a Kurdish-controlled enclave, cut off from a larger expanse of Kurdish territory in the northeast of Syria.

The United Nations said last week that around 75,000 people had been displaced to Tel Rifaat and surrounding areas from Afrin, and more were expected to come.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Buses with loudspeakers blasting out songs about the importance of voting were touring central Cairo on the eve of the Egyptian presidential election, which analysts say lacks credible challengers to President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
Bearing the seal of the Cairo municipality, the buses also displayed printed messages such as ""be positive"" and ""participate in the 2018 presidential election"".
Polls open on Monday for three days in what is effectively a referendum on the performance of former military general Sisi, who is expected to coast to an easy victory against a little-known candidate who is considered a Sisi admirer. 
Sisi, who led the overthrow of Egypt's first freely elected president in 2013, wants a high turnout to affirm his legitimacy after all credible opponents dropped out in January, citing intimidation by the authorities after his main challenger was jailed.
Opposition figures have called for a boycott of the election, while Sisi's campaign spokesman has said the government had not prevented any candidate from running.
Sisi says his first four-year term has brought stability and security and he has urged Egyptians to vote in great numbers.
The military said on Sunday that it had dispatched special vehicles around Egypt to assure Egyptians of a ""secure climate"" for voting, and policemen were seen on Friday handing out posters urging people to vote.
Sisi promised to work for stability when he assumed power but has struggled to defeat an Islamic State insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula and contain other militant attacks across Egypt.
His supporters argue that the security situation now is better than the unrest that rocked Egypt for years after the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011.
MEDIA CENTER
Sisi won nearly 97 percent of the vote when he was first elected in 2014, but less than half of eligible Egyptians voted even though the election was extended to three days from two.
The military on Sunday also said it would monitor local and foreign media coverage of the vote from a specially created media center that would operate 24 hours a day.
Human rights groups say that a crackdown on press freedom has aimed to stifle dissent in the run-up to the vote, with Egyptian authorities calling for legal action against media outlets they deem to be publishing ""fake news"". Rights activists say that several local journalists have been arrested in recent months.
Police and military personnel have taken over polling stations and set up nearby checkpoints to maintain security during the voting process, the military said.
Two policemen were killed and five other people wounded in the coastal city of Alexandria in a bomb attack on Saturday that targeted the local security chief.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, though Islamic State released a video last month in which it warned Egyptians against voting and urged Islamists to attack security forces and leaders.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Investigators looking into a fire that killed at least 64 people at a busy shopping mall in the Siberian city of Kemerovo said on Monday that a security guard had turned off the fire alarm system and that exits had been illegally blocked. 
The fire, one of the deadliest in Russia since the break-up of the Soviet Union, swept through the upper floors of the ""Winter Cherry"" shopping center on Sunday afternoon where a cinema complex and children's play area were located.
Dozens of children were feared to be among the dead.
President Vladimir Putin, re-elected last weekend, has yet to speak publicly about the tragedy, but spoke by telephone with the governor of the Kemerovo region and dispatched the head of the Emergency Situations Ministry to Kemerovo, a coal-producing region about 3,600 km (2,200 miles) east of Moscow.
Putin ""expressed his deep condolences to the relatives and loved ones of those who died,"" the Kremlin said in a statement.
Russia's Investigative Committee, which handles major crimes, said it was trying to bring in the mall's owner for questioning and wanted to detain a security guard who had turned off the fire alarm system after learning of the blaze.
""Serious violations (of the law) took place when the mall was being built and when it was functioning. The fire exits were blocked,"" Svetlana Petrenko, a spokeswoman for the committee, said in a statement.
She said investigators, who have opened a criminal investigation into the blaze, were looking into other possible violations too. Four people have already been detained, including the owners and lessees of outlets inside the mall.
Emergency services said they had extinguished the blaze, but later said it had reignited in places, and that rescuers were struggling to recover bodies beneath smoldering rubble. 

It was unclear if any people were still unaccounted for. Veronika Skortsova, the health minister, said from the scene that 11 people were in hospital, including an 11-year-old boy who was in a serious condition. Russian media said the boy had leapt from a window and that both his parents had been killed.

GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - The humanitarian situation in Democratic Republic of Congo is getting worse by the day, the European Union's top aid official said on Sunday, as the Congolese government shunned a conference seeking to alleviate the suffering.
Multiple crises are spiraling out of control in Congo - in the central Kasai region and in the eastern Kivu and Ituri provinces - aggravated by President Joseph Kabila's refusal to step down at the end of his elected mandate in 2016. 
Over 13 million Congolese need humanitarian aid, twice as many as last year, and 7.7 million face severe food insecurity, up 30 percent from a year ago, the United Nations said in a report earlier this month.
It has declared the crisis to be at Level 3, the world body's highest-level emergency.
""We all believe that the humanitarian situation is getting worse day by day. It's not business as usual,"" said Christos Stylianides, European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management. 
He spoke to Reuters during a trip to eastern Congo. 
Concern over the deterioration of the situation in Congo, a country with a long history of war and humanitarian crises, has pushed the United Nations, the European Union and donor nations to organize a conference in Geneva next month.
They are seeking to raise $1.7 billion, nearly four times the amount secured last year, to support humanitarian activities in Congo.
But Congo this week disputed the U.N. assessment of the gravity of the crisis, which it said would discourage investment at a time when the government was attempting to stabilize the volatile economy. 
""Activating the highest level of humanitarian emergency based on facts that are not real constitutes a hindrance to development,"" the government said in a statement on Thursday.
It added that, unless the humanitarian statistics were brought in line with the government's own figures, it would not send representatives to the conference in Geneva.
Stylianides, who was touring Congo's hard-hit North Kivu province on Sunday, was due to travel to the capital Kinshasa later in the day to attempt to convince the foreign and humanitarian affairs ministers to reverse the decision. 

""We will try to persuade them that this is not good for DRC but above all for the vulnerable people in DRC,"" he said.

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, currently on his first visit to the United States as heir apparent, has promised to promote a more moderate form of Islam under plans to modernize the deeply conservative Muslim kingdom.
The Saudi education minister last week said the country was revamping its education curriculum to eradicate any trace of Muslim Brotherhood influence and dismiss anyone working in the sector who sympathizes with the banned group.
In a new study of select textbooks in use in Saudi Arabia, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) said in a statement on Saturday it had compared twelve 2017-2018 high school religion textbooks with versions from 2012-2014 and found that the current books contained not only numerous intolerant and ""inflammatory"" passages but also several passages specifically thought to have been removed from earlier books.
It said examples of intolerant content included passages extolling jihad - or holy war - as fighting against non-Muslims, prescribing execution of apostates and those who mock God or the Prophet Mohammad, and demeaning non-Muslims and warning Muslims against associating with them.
The Saudi government information office did not immediately respond when asked for comment.
The USCIRF review matches a report last year by Human Rights Watch that said a review of religion books produced by the Education Ministry for the 2016-2017 school year found that the curriculum promotes intolerance.
The commission said such passages demonstrate how little progress has been made over the last 15 years in textbook reform in the kingdom - whose late King Abdullah bin Abdul-Aziz launched an overhaul of state schools and universities in 2005 as part of reforms designed to ease the influence of religious clerics, build a modern state and create jobs. 
""USCIRF urges (the U.S.) Congress and the administration to make textbook reform a priority in its engagement with the Saudi government, especially in light of that government's progress in other areas of reform,"" USCIRF Chairman Daniel Mark said.
Prince Mohammed is visiting the United States to attract investment and drum up support for domestic economic reforms. 
On a visit to Britain earlier this month, the crown prince met the head of the Anglican church in London and promised to promote interfaith dialogue as part of reforms.

CHISINAU (Reuters) - The former president of Romania Traian Basescu joined more than 10,000 people in the Moldovan capital on Sunday to rally in support of reunification between Romania and Moldova.
Union between European Union member Romania and its smaller neighbor to the northeast looks unlikely but the issue highlights a divide in Moldova between pro-Western and Moscow-backed political factions ahead of elections in November.
The country that is now Moldova was part of Tsarist Russia during the 19th century and known as Bessarabia. After World War One it joined what was known as Greater Romania but it was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. When the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, it became independent under the name Moldova.
It is now split between a Romanian-speaking majority and the breakaway region Transdniestria, which is propped up by Russia in one of a series of ""frozen conflicts"" that have kept separatist regions in several former Soviet republics under Moscow's wing.
""We call upon the deputies of the Moldovan and Romanian parliament to vote in the near future for unification,"" Basescu said at the demonstration, which was timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of Moldova joining Greater Romania. 
There was no official reaction from the Romanian side. 
The demonstration was peaceful though police said they detained 21 people who wanted to disrupt the rally, seizing gas masks, masks and knives.
The Moldovan government, which favors closer ties with the European Union and the United States, often locks horns with the pro-Russian President Igor Dodon, who wants closer ties to Moscow and to join a Moscow-led customs union. 
If his Socialist party wins elections due in 2018, Dodon has previously suggested passing a law that bans unionist organizations seen to be undermining the integrity of the state because they want to join Romania. 
Dodon asked those who oppose reunification not to stage a rival rally on Sunday. 
""I urge all patriots and statesmen not to march against the unionists on March 25. We should not give them an additional reason for demonstrations or provocations,"" Dodon said.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel will invest nearly 1 billion shekels ($287 million) in a project to make data about the state of health of its population available to researchers and private companies, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday.
Almost all of Israel's nine million citizens belong to four health maintenance organizations (HMOs) who keep members' records digitally, thus comprising a huge medical database.
""This is a major asset and we want to make it accessible to researchers and developers in order to achieve two things: one is preventive medicine, and the second is personal medicine tailored to each individual,"" Netanyahu told his cabinet.
Nadav Davidovitch, head of the Public Health School at Ben Gurion University in southern Israel, said the country's push to harness big data for healthcare had huge potential, but also held risks in terms of privacy and medical confidentiality.
In an interview with Reuters, he voiced concern that private companies would profit by using a publicly-funded database while continuing to make some medication unaffordable to many patients.
A statement from Netanyahu's office said that mechanisms would be put in place to keep information anonymous while protecting privacy, information security and restricting access as part of the government project. 
Patients will be able to refuse the use of their information for research, the statement said. 
Digital health records are valuable. Big data analytics - comparing information provided by large numbers of patients - give some of the world's biggest drugmakers indications of how medicines perform in the real world. 
Netanyahu said world leaders and international firms have already shown interest in the project and that the potential revenue for Israel could be in the billions of dollars.
All the world's major drug companies now have departments focused on the use of real-world data across multiple diseases. Several have completed scientific studies using the information to delve into key areas addressed by their drugs.
They include diabetes studies by AstraZeneca and Sanofi (PA:SASY), joint research by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb into stroke prevention, and a Takeda Pharmaceutical project in bowel disease. 

Real-world evidence involves collecting data outside traditional randomised clinical trials, the current gold standard for judging medicines, and interest in the field is ballooning.

Nur Mohamed, a Mogadishu police officer, told Reuters the bomb went off at the heavily guarded Sayidka checkpoint.
Abdikadir Abdirahman, director of Amin ambulances, the city's sole rescue service, said three people had been killed, excluding the bomber, and one injured. 
A Reuters photographer at the scene saw ruined cars and three-wheeled scooters overturned by the force of the blast. 
There was no immediate claim of responsibility. The al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab militant group frequently carries out bombings and other attacks in Mogadishu in a campaign to topple Somalia's Western-backed federal government.
At least 14 people were killed on Thursday when al Shabaab set off a bomb outside a busy Mogadishu hotel.

PARIS (Reuters) - Hundreds of friends, family and local officials attended a memorial service in Trebes on Sunday to honor the victims of the Islamist militant attack that killed a gendarme and three other people in southwest France.
Gendarme Arnaud Beltrame, 44, who voluntarily took the place of a female hostage during the supermarket siege on Friday in the tranquil town near the Pyrenees mountains, received a special tribute for what French President Emmanuel Macron had described as a heroic act.
Beltrame died on Saturday after being shot during the siege. Other victims were a winegrower who had been in a car the attacker stole in Carcassonne, as well as a butcher and a shopper at the supermarket.
""A life given can not be lost. It transcends misfortune to rally us in unity, it calls us to believe in life stronger than death,"" regional Carcassonne and Narbonne Bishop Alain Planet said at the ceremony, which was also attended by representatives of the police and the Muslim community.
TRUMP TRIBUTE
U.S. President Donald Trump emphasized Beltrame's heroic act on Sunday after sharing his ""thoughts and prayers"" with the victims of the attacks the previous day.
""France honors a great hero. Officer died after bravely swapping places with hostage in ISIS (Islamic State)-related terror attack,"" he said on Twitter.
Flowers and messages in tribute to Beltrame were placed in front of the gendarmerie of the medieval city of Carcassonne, where he was based. Several cities, the National Assembly and police stations across France flew their flags at half-mast in his honor.
Macron decided on Saturday that France would hold a national tribute to Beltrame in the coming days.
""He fell as a hero, giving up his life to halt the murderous enterprise of a jihadist terrorist,"" Macron said in a statement shortly before dawn on Saturday.
The attacker was identified by authorities as Radouane Lakdim, a 25-year-old Moroccan-born French national from Carcassonne.
The Islamic State militant group on Friday claimed responsibility for the attack. 
Several hundred investigators devoted to the inquiry were still checking the claim and looking into possible help Lakdim could have received, Macron's office said. 
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES
Searches at the attacker's home on Saturday showed notes referring to Islamic State in what appeared to be a will, as well as a phone and a computer, judicial sources said.
Investigators also found three improvised explosive devices, a 7.65 mm handgun and a hunting knife in the supermarket, a source said.
Police were holding two people as part of the investigation - a woman connected to Lakdim and a 17-year-old male said to be one of his friends.
Since 2015 more than 240 people have been killed in France in attacks by assailants who either pledged allegiance to Islamic State or were inspired by the ultra-hardline group.
France is part of a group of countries whose warplanes have been bombing Islamic State strongholds in Iraq and Syria, where in recent months IS has lost much of a self-proclaimed ""caliphate"" of territory it seized in 2014.
Friday's assault was the first deadly Islamist attack in France since last October, when a man stabbed two young women to death in the port city of Marseille before soldiers killed him.

Several attacks over the past year or more have targeted police and soldiers deployed in large numbers to protect civilians and patrol sensitive spots such as airports and train stations.

Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League, ""has proved he keeps his word,"" 5-Star's Luigi Di Maio said in an interview with daily Corriere della Sera on Sunday.
Asked whether his movement could side with the League to form a government, Di Maio did not rule anything out.
""We have shown we are open (to talk) with everyone for the good of the country as long as the dialogue focuses on the priorities for the people and not for parties,"" Di Maio said.
A national election on March 4 ended in a hung parliament, with the 5-Star becoming the largest party and a rightist alliance, including the League and former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party, emerging as the biggest bloc.
The 5-Star and the right have enough seats in parliament to govern Italy, but there are many impediments to such a deal in terms of policy mismatches and personality clashes.
After days of behind the scenes talks, the 5-Star Movement and the rightist alliance joined forces on Saturday to elect 5-Star heavyweight Roberto Fico as president of the lower house and Forza Italia veteran Elisabetta Casellati president of the Senate - both highly prestigious posts. [L8N1R60I5]
The conservative alliance had come close to collapse on Friday after the League sided with 5-Star to reject Forza Italia's first choice for the Senate position, with Berlusconi accusing Salvini of betrayal.
This was a first sign the League could join forces with 5-Star on concrete issues and that Berlusconi had to play second fiddle to Salvini.
Both the League and 5-Star have voiced fierce hostility to EU budget rules and markets are likely to be spooked by any sign they might form a coalition. However, their divergent economic platforms have represented a serious hurdle to alliance deals so far.
Di Maio said on Sunday that 5-Star was keen on tax cuts, tackling youth unemployment, undoing recent pensions cuts and increasing welfare measures for families.
He also rejected the idea of a government of technocrats that could stay in charge for the time needed to reform the current electoral law and lead to new elections in the short term.
""These are practices of the past that we do not accept any more,"" he said. 

Consultation to form a new government, which will be led by President Sergio Mattarella, are expected to start early next month.

Opposition parties boycotted Saturday's polls, claiming the chamber, created by a new constitution enacted in 2016, was a blatant push to further entrench Ouattara's control over a parliament already packed with his allies.
Candidates representing the ruling RHDP coalition took 50 of the 66 seats up for grabs in the indirect polls, in which around 7,000 sitting members of parliament and regional and municipal officials cast ballots. Independents took the remaining 16 seats. 
Those results must now be validated by the Constitutional Court. 
Under the constitution, Ouattara will appoint the final 33 seats of the 99-seat senate.
Ouattara, a former senior International Monetary Fund official, has been lauded abroad for transforming Ivory Coast into one of Africa's fastest growing economies in the wake of a decade-long political crisis capped by a 2011 civil war.
But a wave of army mutinies last year and political uncertainty heading into presidential elections in 2020 have served as a reality check for foreign investors. 
Ouattara faces term limits that bar him from seeking re-election as president, and he has in the past said he does not intend to serve beyond his second term. 
However, a referendum in 2016 made it easier to amend the constitution, requiring only a vote in parliament to enact changes. And senior figures in Ouattara's RDR party have publicly called for him to stand again.

Northern Ireland, which will become Britain's only land frontier with the European Union after Brexit in March 2019, remains the most difficult issue in talks between Brussels and London, and a threat to peace in the British province.
Both Britain and the EU are committed to keeping a free flow of people and goods over the Irish border without returning to checkpoints -- symbols of the three decades of violence in the region largely ended by the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. 
However, finding a practical solution for any customs checks needed after Brexit has proved elusive. 
""The point has now come where it is so serious that we have to enshrine this in law,"" Labour shadow Brexit minister Keir Starmer told the Observer newspaper.
Ahead of a speech on Monday in which he will accuse ministers of backsliding, he said the Labour Party would put forward a proposed change to Brexit legislation currently going through parliament to make sure the government keeps to its promises on Northern Ireland.
Labour has its own internal divisions on Brexit. These were exposed on Friday when Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn sacked his shadow Northern Ireland minister after he called for a second referendum on Brexit.
The government's preferred solution for Northern Ireland is for a customs agreement that allows for as much frictionless trade with the EU as possible, mitigating the need for border checks. Labour wants a formal customs union with the EU.
On Sunday, Brexit minister David Davis repeated the government's vow to find a way to avoid a hard border in the British province after leaving the EU, saying there would be no checkpoints and no cameras.
""What we're going to do is ensure that the border that exists now, which after all is a border for excise and tax, even currency, will continue to exist but back away,"" he told the BBC. 

""It won't be visible; there won't be any return to the borders of the past.""

513,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2018 10:16AM ET</span>",Former Catalan leader Puigdemont detained in Germany,"By Sam Edwards and Joseph Nasr
BARCELONA/BERLIN (Reuters) - Former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont was detained on Sunday in Germany five months after he went into self-imposed exile from Spain, where he faces up to 25 years in prison for organizing an illegal referendum on secession last year.
Puigdemont had entered Germany from Denmark after leaving Finland on Friday when it appeared police would arrest him there and begin an extradition process requested by Spain. [nL8N1R60CR]
The detention threatens to worsen the Catalan crisis which flared last year when the region made a symbolic declaration of independence, prompting Madrid to take direct rule.
Pro-independence groups called on Sunday for a protest in Barcelona in support of Puigdemont outside the offices of the delegation of the European Commission and the German consulate.
German police said they had arrested Puigdemont in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein on a European arrest warrant issued by Spain.
In a statement, police said Puigdemont was detained near a section of the A7 highway which cuts through the state from the city of Flensburg near the Danish border. 
Police did not say exactly where Puigdemont, who had been living in Brussels since late October, was being held but the Spanish press said he was at a police station in the nearby town of Schuby.
German magazine Focus said Spanish intelligence informed the BKA federal police that Puigdemont was on his way from Finland to Germany. It gave no source for its report.
He had arrived in Finland on Thursday to meet lawmakers and attend a conference.
EXTRADITION ISSUE
It is not clear if Puigdemont will be immediately extradited from Germany.
The Spanish prosecutor's office said on Sunday it was working closely with counterparts in Germany and EU agency Eurojust to provide all of the information needed to make the European arrest warrant for Puigdemont effective.
The European arrest warrant system in place since 2004 makes it easier for EU countries to demand the extradition from other EU states of people wanted for crimes, and removes political decision-making from the process.
EU countries issue thousands of such warrants each year.
Puidgemont could take his case to Germany's highest court, which had in 2005 blocked the extradition to Spain on an EU arrest warrant of a German-Syrian al-Qaeda suspect.
The case of Mamoun Darkazanli sparked a judicial row between the two countries after Germany's Federal Constitutional court refused to turn over Darkazanli, saying that EU extradition laws designed to speed up the delivery of suspects between member states violated the rights of German citizens.
Puigdemont had previously made clear his preference to fight the extradition process from Belgium, where the former Catalan leader was heading at the time of his detention, according to Puigdemont’s spokesman, Joan Maria Pique.
""The president was going to Belgium to put himself, as always, at the disposal of Belgian justice,"" Pique told Reuters.
The Spanish Supreme Court had issued an international arrest warrant against Puigdemont last year but withdrew it in December to avoid the risk of Belgian authorities granting him asylum.
Leaving Belgium had exposed him again to the risk of arrest.
Spain's Supreme Court ruled on Friday that 25 Catalan leaders would be tried for rebellion, embezzlement or disobeying the state. 
Supreme Court judge Pablo Llarena also sent five separatist leaders to pre-trial jail. Their detention sparked protests across Catalonia.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis, starting Holy Week services leading to Easter, urged young people on Sunday to keep shouting and not allow the older generations to silence their voices or anesthetize their idealism.
Francis spoke a day after hundreds of thousands of young Americans and their supporters answered a call to action from survivors of last month's Florida high school massacre and rallied across the United States to demand tighter gun laws. He did not mention the demonstrations.
The 81-year-old Roman Catholic leader led a long and solemn Palm Sunday service before tens of thousands in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ), many of them young people there for the Catholic Church's World Day of Youth.
Carrying a woven palm branch known as a ""palmurello,"" Francis led a procession in front of the largest church in Christendom to commemorate the day the Bible says Jesus rode into Jerusalem and was hailed as a savior, only to be crucified five days later.
Drawing on biblical parallels, Francis urged the young people in the crowd not to let themselves be manipulated.
""The temptation to silence young people has always existed,"" Francis said in the homily of a Mass.
""There are many ways to silence young people and make them invisible. Many ways to anesthetize them, to make them keep quiet, ask nothing, question nothing. There are many ways to sedate them, to keep them from getting involved, to make their dreams flat and dreary, petty and plaintive,"" he said.
""Dear young people, you have it in you to shout,"" he told young people, urging them to be like the people who welcomed Jesus with palms rather than those who shouted for his crucifixion only days later.
""It is up to you not to keep quiet. Even if others keep quiet, if we older people and leaders, some corrupt, keep quiet, if the whole world keeps quiet and loses its joy, I ask you: Will you cry out?""
The young people in the crowd shouted, ""Yes!""
While Francis did not mention Saturday's marches in the United States, he has often condemned weapons manufacturing and mass shootings.
Palm Sunday marked the start of a hectic week of activities for the pope. 
On Holy Thursday he is due to preside at two services, including one in which he will wash the feet of 12 inmates in a Rome jail to commemorate Jesus' gesture of humility toward his apostles the night before he died. 

On Good Friday, he is due to lead a Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession at Rome's Colosseum. On Saturday night he leads a Easter vigil service and on Easter Sunday he delivers his twice-yearly ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) message.

Militant group Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, which followed another blast that was claimed by the group in Kabul last week and killed about 30 people near a Shi'ite shrine as the city celebrated Nawruz, the Persian new year.
Deputy police chief Aminullah Amin said that two bombers had tried to enter the mosque but were challenged by security guards who opened fire on them.
""Our Shi’ite brothers were praying in the mosque when two suicide bombers entered the mosque compound. Fortunately, the bombers were identified by Afghan police and local residents,"" he said.
Amin said that one of the bombers was shot by security guards while the second detonated his explosives.
Health officials said one person was confirmed dead, with eight wounded, but the final figures could change.
Herat, one of the most prosperous cities in Afghanistan, has experienced periodic episodes of violence but has not suffered the same level of attacks as the capital Kabul.
While sectarian violence in mainly Sunni Muslim Afghanistan was previously rare, a series of attacks over recent years, many claimed by Islamic State, have killed hundreds of Shi'ites, many from the Hazara ethnic minority.
The local affiliate of Islamic State first appeared in Afghanistan three years ago. As well as its main stronghold in the eastern region of Nangarhar, on the border with Pakistan, fighters declaring allegiance to the group have been active in northern Afghanistan.
The group has also claimed numerous attacks in Kabul and other cities, though many experts doubt whether it has the capacity to conduct such attacks alone and believe it may have received help at times from other militant groups.

The violence has occurred alongside a general deterioration in security in Afghanistan as Taliban insurgents have fought government forces across much of the country, killing thousands of civilians every year.

OKANAUTONI, Angola (Reuters) - Apart from a few packs of medicine and plastic jars, the shelves at the Okanautoni health center in southern Angola are bare and lack basic drugs for saving lives.
Hours from the nearest town in Cunene province, the clinic has no first-line tuberculosis drugs, no antiretrovirals for HIV, no general antibiotics and just three anti-malarial pills.
Okanautoni is remote but the provincial director for health says clinics without drugs are no exception. ""The public health system is losing credibility,"" said Mendes Esteves at his office in the sleepy provincial capital Ondjiva.
João Lourenço, Angola's first new president in 38 years, has vowed to tackle corruption, attract foreign investment and improve public services such as healthcare, which the government acknowledges suffers from a lack of doctors and medication.
Crippled by 27 years of civil war, healthcare improved after the conflict ended in 2002 as the oil-fueled economy surged and new hospitals and clinics were built. But experts say the country failed to develop a robust system for buying and distributing medicines, or training doctors and nurses.
When the price of oil tumbled in 2014, the economy stalled and the government slashed spending, exposing cracks in the public health service and leaving the population at risk.
Diseases that should be disappearing after more than 15 years of peace are spreading. Tuberculosis has been declining worldwide but in Angola the incidence of TB rose 16 percent from 2002 to 2016, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
Angola suffered the world's worst yellow fever epidemic in a generation in 2016 with about 4,000 suspected cases and 380 deaths, and the country is now in the grip of a malaria outbreak with more than 300,000 cases so far this year.
International health workers say the country is leaving itself open to further outbreaks, with some warning of cholera spreading from neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo and others of a potentially devastating epidemic like ebola - a strain of which struck Angola in 2005.
In 2018, the government committed 4 percent of government expenditure to health, down from 4.3 percent in 2017. By comparison, South Africa spent about 14 percent on health in 2015 and Kenya 6 percent, according to WHO data.
'NEVER ENOUGH'
At the clinic in Okanautoni, plastic gloves, syringes and disinfectant are in short supply. There's no running water and the only electricity is from a generator that runs sporadically.
At night, births are guided by the light of a cell phone. If something goes wrong, patients are driven for two hours down bumpy bush tracks to the nearest hospitals in Chiulo or Xangongo – where conditions too can be precarious.
""We ask for medicine but they don't send us anything,"" said nurse Penitencia Goreti, 33, who said she had repeatedly asked for fresh stock from the municipal government.
""The situation is getting worse,"" she said, as a child, blurry-eyed with malaria, lay on the floor nearby.
Provincial health director Esteves said the sick were starting to shun health centers because they didn't expect them to have any medicine. He said he hoped a batch of first-line TB drugs would come in the next few months, but deliveries had failed to show up before. ""We will see,"" he said with a sigh. 
Nearly 1,000 km away in the capital Luanda, ranked the most expensive city in the world for expatriate workers and home to a luxury-loving Angolan elite, public hospitals are similarly stretched.
At Cacuaco hospital on the capital's outskirts, two doctors see 400 to 700 patients per day. The hospital suffers power outages, there is no functioning X-ray machine and only the most basic medication. Anti-malarial drugs frequently run out.
""We just have so many cases, it's never enough,"" one nurse said as hundreds waited in the humid heat under broken fans. 
Poorer residents in Luanda frequently say they have to pay for medication that should be free at public hospitals. The cost means patients often cut their treatment short, increasing the risk of resistant strains developing.
The Ministry of Health did not respond to requests for comment on the state of the healthcare system. It provided data showing 304,410 cases of malaria had been reported in Angola between Jan. and Feb. 4, with 984 deaths.
After a tour of the northern Zaire province, Health Minister Silvia Lutucuta, said the lack of drugs was being addressed.
""We can't come here and affirm that we have resolved all the medication problems, but the basics and essentials for the functioning of centers is there,"" local media quoted her saying.
RED TAPE AND DELAYS
However, senior medical professionals working in the system said the situation had got worse since Lourenço's new government was appointed. They described severe delays in decision-making and project approvals since Lutucuta took charge in October.
They said the response to the malaria outbreak had been hamstrung by increased red tape, which slowed the distribution of preventative measures such as mosquito nets.
Most sources spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issues.
They described flaws in the way drugs, that are not supplied by international agencies, are procured and distributed. 
Sources said purchases at the local level were not in enough bulk to secure competitive prices while the central procurement system, known as CECOMA, lacked the information and budget to keep the system fully supplied. Drugs also often go missing, they said.
According to one former government source, the Ministry of Health has estimated that half the drugs it buys do not reach their intended destination.
In the one-road town of Chiulo, Cunene, basic medication regularly runs out at the hospital. While Reuters visited wards the last tablets of a vital antibiotic were handed out.
The hospital struggles without mains electricity and has a generator that cuts out at 11 p.m. Water is pumped from a dry river bed but ageing equipment often fails.
Chiulo receives assistance from the Italian charity Medici con L'Africa (CUAMM), which has worked there since 2000. Laura Villosio, a wiry indefatigable doctor from northern Italy, said the water and drugs situation had deteriorated since she first worked in Chiulo a decade ago.
In July, the hospital diagnosed cases of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis but medication to treat it did not arrive until four months later, despite increasingly desperate requests.
For such emergencies, the hospital is supposed to have a small budget of its own to buy drugs, but clinical director Ivo Makonga described the money as a ""fiction"".
Payment, which is centrally controlled in Luanda, takes more than eight months to be processed, if at all, meaning suppliers increasingly refuse to accept orders, Makonga said.
The lack of drugs means Emilio Txikussa faces a bleak future. Five years old, he weighs just over 10 kg, his eyes sunken and belly swollen with severe malnutrition.
He also has HIV and tuberculosis.
For now, the doctor is pleased that he has put on 300 grammes after three days on therapeutic milk. With a big smile she asks if he is feeling better. Beaming, she asks again.

""Tell the doctor, yes,"" his father urges. ""Say yes ... say yes."" Emilio only stares.

518,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2018 04:11AM ET</span>","As Vatican and China talk, Taiwan looks on nervously","By Philip Pullella and Yimou Lee
VATICAN CITY/TAIPEI (Reuters) - Five blocks from the Vatican, on the bustling, tourist-packed street leading to St. Peter's Basilica, a Taiwanese flag flutters from the window of a third story suite of offices that house Taipei's embassy to the Holy See.
These days, the staff inside are anxious. They know that one night they may have to lower that flag - red and blue with a white sun - for the last time. 
As the Vatican and China move closer to a historic deal on the appointment of bishops, which would signal a warming of once-frigid relations, diplomats and scholars say Taiwan could lose the most from the deal..
Under the deal, the Vatican will have a say in negotiations for the appointment of future bishops in China, whose Catholics are divided between an ""underground"" Church loyal to the pope and a government-backed Church.
Even a partial resolution of the issue could open the way for eventual diplomatic relations between Beijing and the Vatican. That would give the Church a legal framework to look after all of China's estimated 12 million Catholics.
It would also leave Taiwan in the diplomatic lurch.
The Vatican is one of only 20 states that still recognize Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China. Beijing insists that if countries want relations with it they must break ties with Taiwan.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry said last month that China had always been sincere in its efforts to improve China-Vatican relations.
A senior Vatican official said however that the accord on bishops ""is not a political one,"" suggesting that it does not include any formal link to diplomatic relations and that the Vatican will not be the next country to switch relations to China from Taiwan.
Catholic leaders in Taipei are also hopeful.
""They (the Vatican and Beijing) won't build diplomatic ties. You need to share common values with each other in order to establish diplomatic ties,"" Archbishop John Hung of Taipei told Reuters in an interview in Taipei.
""The values the Vatican holds are different from those of the Chinese Communist Party. Building ties with the Vatican requires values including freedom and democracy.""
Hung said the Church in Taiwan is ""sleeping well at night"".
But for how long?
LESSER CHILDREN?
Some experts say diplomatic ties between Beijing and the Vatican are inevitable, even if probably not right around the corner.
""The Church does not have preference among its children and it's clear that the Vatican does not want to do anything to displease Catholics on Taiwan"" said Agostino Giovagnoli, a history professor at Milan's Sacred Heart Catholic University and the author of two books on Catholicism in China.
""But strategically the Catholics on the mainland are more important because the future of evangelization of China and all Asia passes through China. It is key for the Catholic Church,"" he told Reuters.
While Taiwan's embassy to the Vatican proudly flies the flag from its window, hosts cultural events and publishes a newsletter, the Vatican's counterpart in Taipei is a study in low-key diplomacy.
It is located in a quiet residential neighborhood in the city's Daan distinct. The only clue of its function is the papal stem of crossed keys and a tiara, or crown. That symbol is not widely known to the general public.
The Vatican's last diplomat on the mainland was expelled in 1951 and the Holy See mission settled in Taiwan, to where Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government fled in 1949 after its defeat by the communist armies of Mao Zedong, founder of the People's Republic of China (PRC). 
Since the 1970s, following the United Nations vote to recognize the PRC as the sole legal China, the Vatican has not appointed a nuncio, or ambassador, to Taiwan. It has kept the status of the mission at the lower level of ""charge d'affaires ad interim"" since.
Diplomats say the Vatican's low profile in Taiwan for four decades has been aimed at placating Beijing, which still sees Taiwan and its sacred territory.
DIPLOMATIC SHOCKWAVES 
In 1999, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, then Secretary of State under Pope John Paul, sent shockwaves through Taiwan's diplomatic corps.
He said the Vatican was ready to move its embassy from Taipei to China ""not tomorrow, but tonight if the Chinese authorities allow it"".
In Vatican directories and diplomatic lists, the ambassador from Taiwan, currently Matthew Shieh-Ming Lee, is listed under ""China,"" not ""Republic of China,"" which is Taiwan's official name now, and was China's official name before 1949. 
The ambiguity is not accidental, diplomats say. By keeping the listing vague and generic, the Vatican has avoided further irritating Beijing as it has tried to seek an agreement about Catholics on the mainland.
It also would make it easier for the Vatican to move its embassy to Beijing eventually while claiming that it is not really abandoning Taiwan, where it would likely leave an ""apostolic"" representation to the local Church.
""It is very interesting that both sides are putting the question of diplomatic relations at the very end of the road, on the horizon,"" Giovagnoli, the history professor, said.
He said that because China's diplomatic and economic strength has grown enormously over the past few decades, it no longer craves the Vatican's diplomatic recognition as it did in the past, making a gradual political rapprochement after a deal on bishops is signed more likely than quick recognition.
""Diplomatic recognition is no longer a quid-pro-quo for a deal on the naming of bishops as it once was,"" Giovagnoli said.
Those who will likely feel most hurt if the Vatican eventually does realign its political relations with Taiwan are the island's 300,000 Catholics.
While they make up less than 2 percent of the island's population, they are disproportionately influential. Taiwan Vice President Chen Chien-jen is a devout Catholic and visited the Vatican in 2016 for the canonization of Mother Teresa.

The Fu Jen Catholic University is considered highly prestigious. The Taiwan Catholic Regional Seminary trains priests from many parts of Asia, including China.

519,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2018 02:50AM ET</span>",Russia denies aiding Afghan Taliban in wake of U.S. general's comments,"KABUL (Reuters) - Russia has rejected comments by NATO's top commander in Afghanistan that it has been supporting and even supplying weapons to the Taliban, in a clash of words that underlines growing tension over Moscow's involvement in the conflict.
In an interview with the BBC last week, General John Nicholson said that Russia had been acting to undermine U.S. efforts in Afghanistan despite shared interests in fighting terrorism and narcotics, with indications that Moscow was providing financial support and even arms.
""We've had weapons brought to this headquarters and given to us by Afghan leaders and said this was given by the Russians to the Taliban,"" he said.
A statement from the Russian embassy in Kabul dismissed the comments as ""idle gossip"", repeating previous denials by Russian officials.
""Once again, we insist that such statements are absolutely baseless and appeal to officials not to talk nonsense,"" the embassy said.
U.S. commanders, including Nicholson, have said on several occasions over the past year that Russia may be supplying arms to the Taliban although no confirmed evidence has so far been made public.
However, Nicholson's comments were unusually blunt and came in a context of growing tensions between NATO members and Moscow over the case of Sergei Skripal, a former intelligence agent found poisoned with a rare nerve agent in Britain.
Russian officials have said that their limited contacts with the Taliban were aimed at encouraging peace talks and ensuring the safety of Russian citizens. Moscow has offered to help coordinate peace talks in Afghanistan.
Taliban officials have told Reuters that the group has had significant contacts with Moscow since at least 2007, adding that Russian involvement did not extend beyond ""moral and political support"".
Moscow has been critical of the United States and NATO over their handling of the war in Afghanistan, but Russia initially helped provide helicopters for the Afghan military and agreed to a supply route for coalition materials through Russia.

Most of that cooperation has fallen apart as relations between Russia and the West deteriorated in recent years over the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria.

520,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2018 04:25AM ET</span>","Japan's Abe apologizes amid cronyism scandal, vows to revise constitution","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, his ratings in a slump amid a suspected cronyism scandal and cover-up, apologized again on Sunday for causing anxiety and loss of confidence in his government.
Protesters urged Abe to resign, as riot police kept tight security outside the venue of his ruling party's annual convention, at which the premier stressed his intention to revise Japan's pacifist post-war, U.S.-drafted constitution.
Abe faces his biggest political crisis since taking office in December 2012 as suspicions swirl about a sale of state-owned land at a huge discount to a nationalist school operator with ties to his wife.
""This problem has shaken the people's confidence in the administration,"" Abe told the convention. ""As head of the government, I keenly feel my responsibility and would like to deeply apologize to the people.""
He pledged a thorough clarification of the facts and the prevention of a recurrence by pulling the government together, but offered no sign of stepping down.
Abe has denied that he or his wife intervened in the sale or that he sought to alter documents related to the deal.
His close ally, Finance Minister Taro Aso, has also denied involvement in the alterations made by ministry officials.
Public opinion polls last weekend showed support for Abe's cabinet sinking as low as 31 percent, with majorities saying he bears some responsibility for the affair.
The sliding support rates could dash Abe's hopes of winning a third three-year term as ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leader in a party vote in September, victory in which would set him on track to become Japan's longest ruling premier.
""We're protesting to defeat Abe's government through our voices and the anger of the people,"" said Fumiko Katsuragi, 69, who was among hundreds of protesters gathered in a Tokyo park where cherry blossoms were in full bloom. 
Some held banners that read ""Go to jail Abe"" and ""No constitutional revision or war,"" while right-wingers gathered nearby amid police security.
Also at the party convention, the LDP adopted a proposal to revise the pacifist constitution in line with a plan floated by Abe last year to explicitly refer to the Self-Defense Forces, as Japan's military is known.
""The time has finally come to tackle constitutional revision, which has been a task since the founding of the party,"" Abe said.
""Let's stipulate the Self-Defense Forces and put an end to a controversy about violation of the constitution.""
Abe proposed last May that the first two clauses of Article 9, which renounces the right to wage war and bans maintenance of a standing military, be unchanged but that a reference to the SDF be added to clarify its ambiguous status.
Despite its literal ban on a standing army, successive governments have interpreted the charter to allow a military exclusively to defense.
Abe wants to make that stance clear in the constitution itself, but says the change will not alter Japan's security policies. Critics worry the revision would open the way to a bigger role for the military overseas. 
Abe's weakened support and a wary junior coalition partner could make it hard for the LDP to push for the change, which would spark a divisive debate.

Japan's constitution has never been amended and any changes require approval by two-thirds of each house of parliament and a majority in a public referendum.

China is in the midst of an ambitious military modernization program overseen by President Xi Jinping with a heavy focus on its air force and navy, from building stealth fighters to adding aircraft carriers.
China insists it has no hostile intent, but its sabre-rattling in the busy South China Sea waterway, and around Taiwan, has touched a nerve in the region and in Washington.
In a statement, the air force said H-6K bombers and Su-30 and Su-35 fighters, among other aircraft, carried out combat patrols over the South China Sea and exercises in the Western Pacific after passing over the Miyako Strait, which lies between two southern Japanese islands.
It did not say when the exercises took place nor specify the parts of the South China Sea or the Western Pacific.
In a ""freedom of navigation"" operation on Friday, a U.S. Navy destroyer came within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island China has built in the South China Sea, provoking condemnation from China, which claims most of the strategic waterway.
Sending Su-35 fighters over the South China Sea aims to help increase the air force's ability to fight far out at sea, the air force said in the statement on its microblog.
Flying across the Miyako Strait, which also sits to the northeast of the self-ruled island of Taiwan that China claims as its own, accorded with international law and practice, it added.
""Air Force exercises are rehearsals for future wars and are the most direct preparation for combat,"" it said.

The more exercises China practices far from its shores the better it will be positioned as ""an important force for managing and controlling crises, containing war and winning battles"", it added.

522,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2018 11:01PM ET</span>","Police, politicians accused of joining Sri Lanka's anti-Muslim riots","By Tom Allard and Shihar Aneez
KANDY, Sri Lanka (Reuters) - Police and politicians backed by the country's former strongman President Mahinda Rajapaksa joined anti-Muslim riots that rocked Sri Lanka's Kandy district this month, according to witnesses, officials and CCTV footage reviewed by Reuters.
Scores of Muslim mosques, homes and businesses were destroyed as mobs ran amok for three days in Kandy, the central highlands district previously known for its diversity and tolerance. The government declared a state of emergency and blocked social media platforms for a week to control the unrest.
The role of police and some local Buddhist politicians suggests the Sri Lankan government lost control of elements of its security forces, and that the violence was more than a spontaneous outbreak fueled by fringe Buddhist extremists and hate-speech spread on social media.
Rajapaksa has denied that he or other leaders of his party were involved. Police said the allegations against officers and politicians were being investigated.
Victims and witnesses, whose accounts were partly backed by CCTV footage seen by Reuters, described members of an elite paramilitary police unit, the Special Task Force (STF), assaulting Muslim cleric and leaders. Local STF commanders declined to comment.
""They came to attack,"" said A.H Ramees, a cleric at a mosque where worshippers say they were beaten by police who were supposed to be protecting them. ""They were shouting. There was filthy language. They said all the problems were because of us, that we were like terrorists.""
Ruwan Gunasekera, a spokesman for the national police force, including the STF, said a special investigation unit was ""probing the deficiencies of the police in the incident"". A second unit was examining the role of political actors, he said.
The riots were the latest example of rising Buddhist nationalism and anti-Muslim sentiment in the region and have unnerved Sri Lanka's multi-ethnic coalition government, which ousted Rajapaksa in an election in 2015, according to analysts and two sources familiar with the government's deliberations.
Buddhists make up about 70 percent of Sri Lanka's 21 million people. Tamils, most of whom are Hindu, account for 13 percent while Muslims make up about 9 per cent of the population.
Sri Lanka's Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara has said the violence in Kandy was ""well organized"" and pointed the finger at members of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), a political party backed by Rajapaksa that scored a huge victory in local elections last month.
At a press conference flanked by senior leaders earlier this month, Rajapaksa said the accusations were politically motivated. In fact, the government fomented the violence to ""get the Muslim vote"" and to distract from its inadequacies, he said.
TRIGGER FOR VIOLENCE
The violence in Kandy was triggered by an attack on a Buddhist truck driver, H.G Kumarasinghe, by four Muslim men after a traffic dispute on Feb. 22.
As Kumarasinghe lay in a coma, calls for retribution and anti-Islam polemics flooded social media and the government ordered the deployment of 1,000 members of the STF. 
Rioting erupted after his funeral 11 days later.
An excerpt of CCTV footage from the first day of attacks reviewed by Reuters showed police letting a large group of men through the cordon protecting the Noor Jummah mosque in Digana, a Kandy township.
The men rush into a multi-story building opposite the mosque. A local SLPP politician, Samantha Perera, can be seen pointing at the higher floors of the building.
Perera confirmed he was the person shown in the footage. He said he was trying to calm the rioters and only found out later the mosque had been attacked. ""I am a good Buddhist. I am not instigating violence against anybody,"" he told Reuters.
Cabinet spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said Perera was under investigation for ""attacking Muslim-owned shops and mosques with stones"". At least three other SLPP politicians, including a national politician, were being investigated and another SLPP councilor has been arrested for setting fire to a mosque, he said. All deny any involvement in the violence.
""There's a political motive to discredit me, Mahinda Rajapaksa and the party,"" Perera said. 
""MONSTER BEYOND CONTROL""
Anti-Muslim sentiment has surged in Sri Lanka since 2009, when a long civil war against Tamil insurgents was brutally ended by Rajapaksa amid charges by a United Nations panel of experts of human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings by the military and STF.
As in Myanmar, from where 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled an army crackdown in recent months, Buddhist hardliners in Sri Lanka have argued that Islam is a threat to the Buddhist way of life.
Though the level of violence is not comparable, the Sri Lankan Secretariat for Muslims, a civil society group, logged more than 600 attacks and threats to Muslims in the past five years, according to director Hilmy Ahamed, who added the rate of anti-Muslim violence had accelerated in the recent years.
""The fear that Muslims are going to take over, are going to deprive you of your welfare, is so widespread,"" he said.
Veteran political analyst Jayadeva Uyangoda said Buddhist chauvinism in Sri Lanka was a ""monster beyond control"", as local activists draw inspiration from the Buddhist extremists in Myanmar and Hindu radicals in India hostile to Muslims.
""CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?""
About 10 minutes after the incident near the Noor Jummah mosque shown in the CCTV footage, the mob returned via a back road, out of the line of sight of the mosque's exterior cameras, and threw a petrol bomb into the mosque's first floor office, according to witnesses Mohamed Niyaskhan, who said he was beaten and left bloodied, and the mosque secretary M.I.M Shukry.
The men burned Korans during 45 minutes of looting and destruction, they said.
Niyaskhan said earlier that day he had prepared food and drinks for STF members protecting the mosque, but they had left shortly before the attack.
""No STF, no police were there,"" he said. ""They had gone around the corner. Can you believe it?""
Later that day, eight to 10 members of the STF rushed the Hijrapura mosque, also in Digana, according to clerics and worshippers.
The police assaulted worshippers with batons, according to Ramees, the cleric.
CCTV footage shows police in riot gear striking Ramees and another cleric, M.S.M Nizam, four times with batons. A local Buddhist monk, Gerendigala Chanda Wimala, told Reuters he saw the men being manhandled by police and successfully demanded their release.
At about the same time, a local Muslim politician, Abdul Saleem Mohamad Fazil, and a friend Mohamad Faizal, were also attacked by members of the elite police unit, according to the victims and a witness, Father Christy Paul, the prelate at Digana's Catholic church.
""Three STFs came through the back entrance of the house and started beating us,"" said Fazil, who suffered a deep head wound and said he spent in a night in prison after being refused medical treatment.
""They grabbed some bottles from the landing and put them in a bag and said we were making petrol bombs.""
Father Christy said he heard the men's screams and saw the police hitting them with batons. The men were cowering on the ground and not offering any resistance to the police, he said.
A local STF commander, asked about the incidents described to Reuters, declined to comment, citing restrictions on talking to the media. The law and order ministry referred to the police special investigation into alleged abuses.

Police say they have arrested more than 300 people involved in the riots.

Authorities had not previously disclosed details of the cellphone video in which Mark Conditt admitted being behind the string of bombings that began on March 2, killing two people and wounding five others, beyond saying that it showed a troubled young man.
""I think the best evidence we have at this point in time is the confession itself ... He did refer to himself as a psychopath. He did not show any remorse, in fact questioning himself for why he didn't feel any remorse for what he did,"" U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul told a news conference in Austin when asked about Conditt's motive.
""It's hard to imagine someone whose mind is so sick that they could commit bombings like this and feel absolutely no remorse,"" he said. 
McCaul said there did not appear to be anything in Conditt's confession ""that was sort of racially motivated, but I know that is still part of the ongoing investigation.""
The first several bombing victims, including the two who died, were either African-American or Hispanic.
Federal investigators have been hunting clues about what drove Conditt, who was unemployed and lived with roommates in the Austin suburb of Pflugerville. They also want to know whether he had help building or planting the bombs.
Three of the devices were left as parcels outside victims' homes, while another was placed on a sidewalk and attached to a trip-wire mechanism. Two more were shipped as FedEx (NYSE:FDX) parcels, which helped investigators unmask the bomber's identity.
The second and third bombs went off while the Texas state capital was hosting its annual South by Southwest music, movies and tech festival, which draws about half a million people.

Conditt died after detonating a explosive device early on Wednesday as police ran toward his vehicle in an Austin suburb.

524,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2018 09:10PM ET</span>",Thai politics: No country for young men?,"By Panu Wongcha-um and Chayut Setboonsarng
BANGKOK (Reuters) - A 39-year-old motor parts billionaire and extreme sports enthusiast seeking to shake up Thai politics has been compared to France's Emmanuel Macron and Canada's Justin Trudeau for his youth.
But Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit sees little prospect of emulating their electoral success even if the junta, which seized power in a May 2014 coup, holds elections as promised next year after several postponements.
""Election laws are unfavorable to us, timing is unfavorable to us, the attitude of the government is unfavorable to us,"" he told Reuters. ""The chance is very slim. But a little hope is better than no hope at all."" 
Thanathorn launched his Future Forward party this month with a big fanfare and a promise to appeal to the youth vote.
But the forces that have divided Thailand for a generation are also mobilizing - and making plain their enduring presence four years after the coup that ousted a 'red' populist government in the name of ending turmoil with a 'yellow' royalist elite.
Thanathorn's party had not even been formally launched before he came under attack from ultra-royalists.
""Future Forward... It is the future for those who want to impede the rights of the king,"" Rienthong Nanna, a retired major-general, wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Thanathorn declined comment on the monarchy - a subject few dare speak of given the world's harshest lese majeste, or royal insult, laws.
He has previously dismissed accusations of being anti-monarchy although his party has also received praise from some of Thailand's most vocal exiles.
""The party offers an alternative path,"" prominent exiled academic and junta critic Pavin Chachavalpongpun told Reuters. ""It's a phenomenon that should have happened a long time ago.""
Thanathorn isn't a total newcomer.
Since student days, he has been part of campaigns against poverty and inequality though in recent years he has spent more time helping run the Thai Summit Group founded by his late father and running ultra-marathons in the Arctic and the Sahara.
VOTE NEXT YEAR?
His emergence comes as the junta starts registering parties ahead of a frequently delayed election now set for 2019. Whether his party will win registration is still in question.
Political success in Thailand depends on being able to placate the military and royalist elite, said Joshua Kurlantzick of the U.S.-based Council on Foreign Relations.
""In France, there was no junta stopping Macron forming a party,"" he told Reuters.
Piyaphong Klinphan, a junta spokesman, said registration was a matter for the election commission, but the junta would make sure nobody could disturb security or break the law.
It has been widely noted in Thailand that Future Forward's orange color is a mix of the red and yellow of the old rivals, although the party has said this is unintentional.
In the ""red shirt"" camp are supporters of ousted former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the last billionaire to shake up Thai politics, whose populist policies won support from farmers, the poor and the heavily populated northeast.
The ""yellow shirt"" camp represents the traditional privilege of the Bangkok based establishment, strongly pro-army and pro-monarchy.
""We need to convince people from all colors to come back and have faith in parliamentary democracy,"" said Thanathorn, a father of three.
His policies include business deregulation and moving decision making out of Bangkok. Thanathorn distances himself from the populism of Thaksin, who was overthrown in 2006 and fled to escape a corruption conviction he says was political. Thaksin's sister, Yingluck, was ousted in the 2014 coup.
One of Thanathorn's uncles served as transport minister under Thaksin and politicians from Thaksin's camp have been more welcoming of Thanathorn's party than the ultra-royalists.
But Thanathorn's party has barely started to build the grassroots structures that helped parties linked to Thaksin win every election since 2001.
In a pro-Thaksin stronghold in Bangkok, only a few kilometers from where Thanathorn launched his party, most of more than 20 people asked by Reuters said they had not heard of him.
All said they would stick with the Pheu Thai Party, whose leaders flew to Hong Kong and Singapore last month for meetings with Thaksin that participants said had focused on preparations for the elections.

""My friends and I will still vote Pheu Thai,"" commented one 58-year-old ""red shirt"" who gave his name only as Na. ""I don't want a young man to lead the country.""

CARACAS (Reuters) - Jose Abreu, the award-winning founder of a program that pulled thousands of Venezuelan children from crime and poverty through music, died on Saturday, aged 78.
Abreu founded the globally acclaimed El Sistema, or The System, in 1975 in a garage with just nine musicians. From that, the network expanded to 300 choirs and orchestras that received awards from the Royal Swedish Academy and UNESCO.
""With devoted love and eternal gratitude to my mentor and father of El Sistema,"" wrote Gustavo Dudamel, a famed Venezuelan conductor now the director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, on Twitter alongside a photo of himself with Abreu.
Abreu was born on May 7, 1939, in the small Andean city of Valera. He began his musical studies at nine and moved to Caracas to study composition.
""Abreu has given life to a musical system with which young people can be safe from the dangers of the street, of crime, of drugs,"" said Simon Rattle, director of the Berlin Philharmonic, according to the El Sistema website.
Abreu's model has been followed by other Latin American countries as well as some in Europe.
Dudamel has become the public face of El Sistema in recent years, often conducting free concerts in Caracas’ grimy downtown area. 
He has spoken out strongly in support of anti-government protests that last year rocked Venezuela for four months, leaving more than 120 people dead, including an 18-year-old musician from the Venezuela National Youth Orchestra.

“We are deeply moved by the physical departure … of Maestro Abreu,” said Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on state television.

One of the candidates is the president's son, Serdar Berdymukhamedov, regarded by observers as a potential successor to the 60-year-old leader, who is referred to by local people as Arkadag, or Protector.
Although the vote takes place against the backdrop of foreign currency shortages brought on by a drop in gas exports, there are no opposition parties in the former Soviet republic of six million.

There are 284 candidates contesting 125 seats in the single-chamber legislature, whose main job is to rubber-stamp bills drafted by the cabinet.
Another legislative body in the predominantly Muslim nation is the Halk Maslahaty, or People's Council, chaired by the president, which has more powers than parliament and consists of deputies elected by local councils.
However, the position of parliament speaker is important, because holders of the office become acting president if the head of state is unable to carry out his work.
Some observers have tipped Serdar Berdymukhamedov, 36, to eventually become speaker and the designated successor to his father, who has run the country since 2007 and is the center of an extravagant personality cult.
A golden statue of the president riding a horse stands in the center of Ashgabat.
In a symbolic move, Serdar Berdymukhamedov, who had worked as a diplomat before becoming an MP in 2016, attended a summit of Central Asian leaders in Kazakhstan this month that his father skipped.
Turkmenistan's economy depends heavily on exports of natural gas and Russia was its main customer for decades, thanks to Soviet-era pipelines. But Moscow halted purchases of Turkmen gas in 2016, leaving as the main buyer China, which has built its own pipeline from scratch.

The Ashgabat government is building a new pipeline through neighboring Afghanistan to Pakistan and China in an attempt to open up additional export markets.

Ituri is the latest part of the Democratic Republic of Congo to descend into bloodshed since President Joseph Kabila's refusal to step aside at the end of his mandate in 2016 undermined the legitimacy of the state.
Army spokesman Jules Ngongo said clashes happened around the villages of Jemi and Penyi, in the Djugu territory. A Congolese soldier had also been killed, and two others wounded.
""Search operations are still under way and the death toll could change,"" Ngongo said.
Of all Congo's complex ethnic tinderboxes, Ituri has historically been the most combustible. It was one of the places where Congo's civil war began in 1998, drawing troops from Uganda and Rwanda into a five-year conflict in which about 5 million people were killed, mostly from hunger and disease.
Many fear Congo is headed for a repeat of that conflict.
After more than a decade of relative peace, an eruption of tit-for-tat killing between the predominantly farming Lendu and the mostly cattle-keeping Hema ethnic groups this year has been fanned by a breakdown of government authority and the failure to resolve a longstanding dispute over land rights. 
The International Criminal Court has convicted warlords from both sides of the previous Ituri fighting, but that has not prevented further violence.

The police said the incident began when a patrol was attacked, though family members of those killed disputed various aspects of that account, according to interviews given to local media. The police said that they had entered Rocinha to search for suspects in the killing of a police officer in the slum earlier in the week and that they recovered various weapons following the incident, including a pair of grenades.
In mid-February, Brazil's federal government ordered the army to take command of security forces in Rio de Janeiro in a bid to curb violence driven by drug gangs.
The already violent city has seen an uptick in crime in recent years. Murders climbed 8 percent in 2017 from the year before and 26 percent over 2015. Shootouts are a daily occurrence in Rio's poorer areas, and the violence has increasingly spilled into Rio's more affluent neighborhoods.
Drug trafficking in Rocinha is controlled by the Red Command, Rio's most powerful drug gang.
The army takeover has not been without controversy. Last week, Marielle Franco, a prominent Rio city councilwoman was murdered in what many suspect was a political assassination, after she heavily criticized police violence in Rio, which many say has been worsened by the army takeover.

The order by Judge Juan Carlos Sanchez bans Kuczynski from leaving Peru for 18 months while his links to Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company that has acknowledged bribing officials across Latin America, are investigated.
""The legal argument is well founded to impede Citizen Pedro Pablo Kuczynski from exiting the country,"" the order said.
The ex-president's lawyer, Cesar Nakazaki, said Kuczynski would abide by the order and cooperate with the investigation.
State security agents, meanwhile, searched two houses belonging to Kuczynski, a former Wall Street banker.
Kuczynski, who denies wrongdoing, resigned on Wednesday. Two days later his vice president, Martin Vizcarra, was sworn in as Peru's new leader, promising to fight corruption ""at any cost.""
Vizcarra said he would form a completely new cabinet and asked for lawmakers to help him restore the public's trust in institutions damaged by the political crisis.

TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - U.S. forces said they had killed ""two terrorists"" in an air strike in southwestern Libya on Saturday as part of efforts to deny militants a safe haven in the country's vast desert.
The strike hit on the outskirts of the city of Ubari and was carried out in coordination with the internationally recognized Government of National Accord in Tripoli, the U.S. Africa Command said in a statement. 
""At this time, we assess no civilians were killed in this strike,"" the statement said.
A witness in Ubari told Reuters by telephone that a large explosion had been heard around midday. 
A house in the Fursan neighborhood was hit and two bodies were found there, he said. Residents from the neighborhood said the house was frequented by foreigners, according to the witness, who did not want to be identified for security reasons.
Pictures in local media showed a body on the ground with several limbs and its head missing, and a car with its windows blown out and dozens of holes in one side.
U.S. forces have carried out occasional air strikes targeting militants in Libya over the past few years. 
They also launched an air campaign against Islamic State in the group's former Libyan stronghold of Sirte in 2016, as local forces battled to oust jihadists from the city.
Last year, the United States said it had killed dozens of suspects in air strikes in desert areas south of Sirte as it tried to stop militants regrouping.
Saturday was the first time it had acknowledged a strike as far south as Ubari, which lies about 700 km (435 miles) south of Tripoli, on the road to Libya's border with Algeria.
Libyan and Western officials have long warned about the risk of militants linked to Islamic State and al-Qaeda using southern Libya as a base.
""We are committed to maintaining pressure on the terror network and preventing terrorists from establishing safe haven,"" the U.S. Africa Command statement said.
It gave no information about the identity of those targeted.
Libya slid into conflict after a 2011 Nato-backed uprising and has had rival governments based in Tripoli and the east for the past four years. 
Competing factions have fought for influence in the country's south, where the Libyan National Army (LNA), which is aligned with the eastern-based government, recently stepped up military activity.
Communal violence has also flared in recent weeks in Sabha, about 170 km northeast of Ubari, displacing hundreds of families.
On Saturday, LNA jets carried out strikes targeting Chadian mercenary forces southeast of Sabha, air force commander Mohamed Manfour said.
Instability in southern Libya has drawn in fighters from Chad and Sudan's Darfur region who have battled for opposing sides in Libya's internal conflict.

AFRIN, Syria (Reuters) - Turkey's military and its Syrian rebel allies have taken full control of northwest Syria's Afrin region, a Turkish army source said on Saturday, as aid workers distributed food to people in the area.
Turkish forces and the Syrian fighters swept into the main Afrin town last Sunday after an eight-week campaign to drive out the Kurdish YPG militia, which Ankara regards as a terrorist group.
A military source told Reuters the last remaining villages had been seized and control established overnight.
""Control has been completely achieved in the Afrin region and search operations are continuing so that local people can return safely to their houses,"" the source said.
State-run Anadolu news agency carried a similar report.
In Afrin, people queued to receive hot food which was being distributed by the Turkish Red Crescent while Turkish soldiers kept security and armored vehicles moved along the streets.
""We are trying to bring back life to normal in the short and medium term here."" the aid group's president Kerem Kinik told Reuters. ""Our mobile kitchens are here, and our crews are in the villages."" 
""We want everything to be alright. We want our women and children to come back. They could not come back to their homeland,"" said Afrin resident Abdurrahman Nahsen Suleymanoglu.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan rejected criticism of the Afrin campaign in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, according to a Turkish presidential source.

Among Turkey's Western allies, France has been one of the biggest critics of the Turkish military operation, with its foreign minister saying concerns for its border security did not justify the incursion.

The prosecutor charged Marinakis with financing and storing drug substances and setting up a criminal group to traffic and sell drugs, a judiciary source said.
The 50-year old shipowner denied any wrongdoing saying that the charges were legally unfounded and accused the country's leftist-led government of plotting against him.
""There is not the least evidence against me,"" Marinakis said in a statement posted on the Olympiakos website, adding that ""members of the governing coalition have persistently targeted me"" and said the results of any investigation would prove his innocence.
The government declined to comment on the case or Marinakis' accusations.
The case emerged four years ago when the Greek coastguard discovered a record two-tonne haul of drugs, mainly heroin, aboard a small tanker called Noor One and in a warehouse near Athens. A court has sentenced 15 people to prison in that case. (Full story https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-greece-ship-drugs/greece-makes-record-heroin-bust-arrests-tanker-crew-idUKKBN0EX0UN20140622)
The charges were brought against Marinakis after a preliminary investigation that looked into financial transfers related to the financing of the tanker, the judiciary source said, requesting anonymity. 
Court authorities have not made any public announcements on the case, which is standard practice in the country. 
An investigating magistrate against corruption is expected to look further into the case, the judiciary source said.

The action follows calls from Prime Minister Boyko Borissov for stern punishment over the March 20 incident that highlights challenges Bulgaria faces in convincing the European Union that it is addressing shortfalls in applying the rule of law.
Bulgaria, an EU member since 2007 and holder since January of the six-month EU presidency for the first time, has had its application to join the EU's Schengen free-movement area rejected.
EU officials have said the government has not done enough to tackle organized crime, corruption and security shortcomings.
Interior Minister Valentin Radev said the border officers could be sacked or face disciplinary sanctions, depending on the outcome of the investigation.
Of the 13, seven officers were part of a team on a shift at the airport who left their posts for about 15 minutes, allowing about 40 passengers flying in from Paris to pass through without having their passport checks.
""It is good that the flight was from Paris,"" Radev told reporters. ""Passengers had been already checked at a European airport and this guarantees no terrorists have entered.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - More than 300 Thai pro-democracy demonstrators marched to the gates of the army headquarters in Bangkok on Saturday to call on soldiers to withdraw their support for the ruling junta.
It was one of the biggest in a new wave of protests against corruption and the government's failure to keep to a promised election timetable.
The marchers demanded soldiers end their backing for the junta, which took power following a May 2014 coup. But the protesters also said they did not want another military takeover.
""We want a peaceful transition,"" Rangsiman Rome, one of the protest leaders, told Reuters. ""It's time for the army and all of Thai society to stop supporting the junta and side with the people.""
Soldiers at the army headquarters declined to respond.
The march began at Bangkok's Thammasat University, a traditional hotbed of discontent.
Unarmed police tried to block the protesters from the street leading to the army headquarters, but gave way and allowed them through. Demonstrators burned incense at the ornate gates and set up a sound system to amplify their message.
""Those of you who are at home, join us ... until we can win this war, until we get what we want,"" said student activist Sirawith Seritiwat, also known as Ja New.
Protesters said they wanted the junta to hold elections in November 2018 as it had promised last year. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has said the vote would not happen until early 2019, the latest delay to a ballot originally planned for 2015.
Protesters have also been angered by corruption scandals, particularly an investigation into the luxury watch collection of Prawit Wongsuwan, a deputy prime minister and defense minister. Last month, a public petition demanded he quit.
Prawit has said he borrowed the timepieces from friends, but would resign if that was the public's wish.
""There is too much corruption. We need democracy back now,"" said Mike Pisek, 70, a former Thai marine.
Many of the protesters were in their 60s or 70s, even if the leaders were students.
The government has allowed recent protests to take place, but many of the leaders face charges for public order offenses.
Protest leaders said they did not plan more marches until May, nearing the fourth anniversary of the 2014 coup.
The army took power saying it aimed to end months of street protests in 2013 and 2014 in Bangkok led by the now-defunct People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC), which were aimed at ousting the civilian government of then-Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and counter-protests by her red-shirted supporters.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - It might be called Cappuccino Catholicism.
Young Catholics told their Church elders on Saturday that the faith should be spread in the places where they like to hang out, such as coffee bars.
""We would like the Church to meet us in the various places in which she currently has little or no presence,"" reads part of a 12-page document written by some 300 young Catholic delegates from around the world, who met for a week at the Vatican.
""The Church should try to find creative new ways to encounter people where they are comfortable and where they naturally socialize: bars, coffee shops, parks, gyms, stadiums and any other popular cultural centers,"" it said.
The delegates met in Rome to share their ideas and concerns with Vatican officials ahead of a synod, or meeting of bishops, in October, on the theme of ""Young People, the Faith and Vocational Discernment"".
At a news conference presenting the paper, which will feed into a larger working document to be used by the bishops, participants said they wanted their Church to be more open and transparent and less severe.
The document called for a greater role for women in the Church, which bars them from the priesthood.
""What are the places where women can flourish within the Church and society? The Church can approach these problems with real discussion and open-mindedness to different ideas and experiences,"" it said.
""If it is difficult for young people to feel a sense of belonging and leadership in the Church, it is much more so for young women,"" the document said.
They said they wanted to ""encourage the Church to deepen its understanding of the role of women and to empower
young women ...""
Earlier this month, Catholic women led by former Irish president Mary McAleese, demanded a greater decision-making role for women in the Church, urging the pope to tear down its ""walls of misogyny"".
The document said the 1.2 billion-member Church ""oftentimes appears as too severe and is often associated with excessive moralism"". It called for a Church that is ""welcoming and merciful ... and which loves everyone, even those who are not

following the perceived standards"".

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Ivorians voted for a new senate on Saturday in a poll likely to shore up President Alassane Ouattara's grip on power, amidst an opposition boycott, while doing little to relieve ethnic tensions lingering from a decade of crisis.
The creation of the upper house, a provision of the new constitution enacted by referendum in late 2016, was seen by Ouattara's opponents as a blatant power grab, while his supporters defended it as an expansion of checks and balances.
Ouattara gets to appoint one third of the chamber, while the rest are elected, although the main opposition party refused to field any candidates, so the ruling Rally of the Republicans (RDR) was expected to romp home.
Ivorians disagreed about whether there was any point to the new chamber. In Ivory Coast's powerful executive presidential system, the lower chamber was already seen as a rubber stamp. 
""We need schools, we need hospitals more than we need senators,"" said David Banga as he walked in an Abidjan street near a voting booth. ""These elections are no use to us. Money that could be used for education, health and security is going into the pocket of 100 friends of the president.""
But Gilberte Banier, a local council worker standing outside a polling station in Abidjan's leafy, palm-lined Cocody district, said: ""This is a good thing. We need to have strong institutions. This will reinforce them.""
Since 2011, Ivory Coast has re-emerged from turmoil as one of Africa's fastest growing economies, with a roaring 2 million tonnes a year of cocoa production and a lagoon-side commercial capital that is a billowing hub for regional investment.
But the crisis, which culminated in a short but vicious civil war when former President Laurent Gbagbo refused to concede an election, could yet reignite. 
Several army mutinies have broken out in the past two years, instigated by former rebels who have been integrated only haphazardly into military ranks.

Partly as a result, Ivory Coast is deep in debt from having to pay off all those soldiers to silence their guns.

YEKATERINBURG/MOSCOW (Reuters) - As Russia hurries to spruce up its venues for this year's soccer World Cup, the Urals city of Yekaterinburg on Saturday blew up its most famous landmark -- a rusty, half-finished Soviet-era television tower.
Local authorities in 11 host cities including Moscow, St Petersburg, Sochi and Yekaterinburg are working hard on preparations for the June 14-July 15 tournament, but not all residents are happy with their beautifying efforts.
In Yekaterinburg, hundreds of people opposed to the television tower's demolition by controlled explosion took part in a ""Hug the Tower"" rally earlier this week.
Ivan Volkov, a 39-year-old lawyer and head of a committee opposing the tower's destruction, said the 220-metre (720 feet) high concrete structure had been a symbol of the city's identity.
""Now it's the symbol of the people's humiliation at the hands of the authorities because the decision was made behind-the-scenes. It shouldn't be done this way"", Volkov, told Reuters.
The tower's construction started in 1983 but it was never completed due to the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Local governor Eugene Kuivashev defended the decision to demolish it.

""No one seriously believes that the city needs such a symbol,"" he said in a radio interview.

The Muslim-majority country has been on high alert since gunmen allied with Islamic State (IS) carried out a series of attacks in Jakarta, the capital of neighboring Indonesia, in January 2016.
Six Malaysians were arrested in Johor state, north of Singapore, while a seventh, a Filipino member of the IS-linked Abu Sayyaf group, was detained in the eastern state of Sabah, in multiple operations between Feb. 27 and Mar. 15, Inspector-General of Police Mohamad Fuzi Harun said in a statement. 
He said the six detained in Johor were members of an IS cell and included a 37-year-old technician who recruited new militants and was believed to be the mastermind of planned attacks on non-Muslim places of worship in the state's capital.
A second suspect was a security guard who served as the cell's advisor and ensured members kept their activities secret. A third man was tasked with buying firearms from a neighboring country and identifying targets for attacks, he said.
""All of them planned to escape to a neighboring country and seek shelter from members of a militant group there after successfully carrying out the plan,"" Muhamad Fuzi said, without naming the country. 
Authorities arrested three other members of the same cell in follow-up operations, including a 25-year-old restaurant worker who had been ordered to kidnap and kill police personnel. 
Police also detained a 31-year-old Philippine national in Sabah, on Borneo island, who was said to be a trusted lieutenant to Abu Sayyaf group leader Furuji Indama and has links to Malaysian militant Mahmud Ahmad, Mohamad Fuzi said. 
The man, wanted by the Philippines for his involvement in a a kidnap-for-ransom syndicate, was also an expert in making improvised explosive devices.
Mohamad Fuzi said the suspect had planned to carry out several attacks in Sabah and was responsible for making the state a safe haven for terror groups from the Philippines. 
Malaysia has arrested hundreds of people over the past few years for suspected links to militant groups.
A grenade attack on a bar on the outskirts of the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, in June 2016 wounded eight people. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, the first such strike on Malaysian soil.

The protesters marched down the main streets of the capital Zagreb, carrying a huge banner reading ""Stop the Istanbul (Convention) for Sovereign Croatia,"" waving national flags and singing patriotic songs.
Earlier this week, Croatia's conservative government adopted the treaty, designed to combat violence against women, despite opposition from within its own ranks, conservative groups and the local Catholic Church.
While supporting the protection of women, opponents object to the treaty's definition of gender, which they say paves way for introducing transsexual or transgender as separate categories, which they oppose.
Last month, the same treaty was rejected in two other eastern European Union countries, Bulgaria and Slovakia, for similar objections about the definition of gender as ""social roles, behaviors, activities and characteristics that a particular society considers appropriate for women and men.""
The Croatian government has urged the parliament to ratify the treaty, known as the Istanbul Convention, and also adopted a separate statement saying the treaty will not change Croatia's legal definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman.
But protesters said the ratification was unacceptable. 
""This is betrayal!"", ""Plenkovic, leave!"", the protesters chanted, calling for Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic to step down.
""I think this is a turning point for Croatia when we must decide whether Croatia will choose a preservation of family and traditional values or we will go another way imposed from outside, from Brussels or like what we see in Canada where there will be a parent 1 and parent 2 instead of mother and father,"" said Kristina Pavlovic, a protest organiser.
Treaty opponents have said they will push for a referendum on the issue. But according to a poll conducted for the government this week, two thirds of Croatians back ratifying the treaty.
A small counter-rally was organized in support of the treaty, and police had to divide the two groups after they verbally clashed. 
The treaty's supporters said many protesters, including war veterans, were brought by buses from other towns and outside of Croatia to attend the rally, which they said was politically-motivated.

""I protest for my grandchild, grand-grandchild and all those who gave their lives for Croatia,"" an elderly man told the N1 television. ""I am a grandfather, I am not going to be a parent 1 nor a parent 2.""

DUBAI (Reuters) - Sayed Ahmed AlWadaei, a prominent Bahraini rights campaigner exiled in Britain, said on Saturday a Bahraini court had sentenced his wife to two months in jail in absentia this week and that his mother-in-law had begun a hunger strike in jail.
AlWadaei, director of the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) and one of the most outspoken critics of the Gulf island kingdom, alleges the government's treatment of his family was aimed at silencing his activism.
""Their escalation against both of my family members was no coincidence,"" AlWadaei, who has lived in exile since 2012, told Reuters. Asked if Bahraini authorities were trying to muzzle him, he replied, ""Of course. My wife was beaten, mistreated and threatened that they are going after our family to punish me. Now all their threats were executed.""
Bahraini authorities did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. 
A close U.S. and British ally, Sunni Muslim-ruled Bahrain has cracked down on the opposition, hailing mostly from the Shi'ite Muslim majority, since it crushed pro-democracy demonstrations they led in 2011.
Rights groups have accused authorities of seeking to stamp out dissent. The government says the opposition is linked to militants backed by their arch-enemy Iran who have carried out years of deadly bombing and shooting attacks on security forces.
AlWadaei's wife Duaa was detained and interrogated as she and their son departed Bahrain's airport after a visit in 2016.
When she complained that she was physically abused during questioning about his activities and movements - charges authorities have denied - she was charged with insulting state institutions and sentenced in absentia to two months in jail on Wednesday, AlWadaei said.
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert criticised Duaa AlWadaei's sentence and urged the kingdom, where the U.S. bases its Fifth Fleet, not to prosecute free speech.
""We saw the report that a Bahraini criminal court sentenced her in absentia to ... two months in prison for allegedly insulting a state institution. Really?""
""We strongly urge the government to abide by its international obligations and commitments to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and that includes the freedom of expression.""
AlWadaei also said his mother-in-law Hajer Mansoor Hassan began a hunger strike on Tuesday to protest against alleged restrictions to her privacy and monitoring of phone calls, and was moved to an Interior Ministry hospital two days later.
She was sentenced to three years in jail in October for planting a ""fake bomb"" meant to taunt police. She denied the charges.
Another female activist at the same prison, Medina Ali, also began a hunger strike to protest against a strip search and in solidarity with Hassan, BIRD reported.

The Times said its correspondent, 33-year-old Bel Trew who had been based in Cairo for several years, was arrested while reporting and ""forced to leave Egypt.""
""The Times deplores this attempt by the Egyptian authorities to intimidate the media and suppress our coverage,"" a statement by the newspaper said, adding that Egyptian authorities had ""no intention of allowing (Trew) to return.""
Egypt's government foreign press center, the interior ministry, and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's office, did not respond to phone calls and requests for comment via WhatsApp.
Trew said in a separate article published by The Times that she was detained by police in central Cairo on her way to conduct an interview, held for almost 24 hours and then ""marched onto a plane"" at Cairo airport bound for London.
Her deportation follows what human rights groups call a crackdown on press freedom aimed at stifling dissent in the run-up to the March 26-28 presidential election.
Egyptian authorities have urged legal action against media outlets they deem to be publishing ""fake news"", and rights activists say several local journalists have also been arrested in recent months.
Sisi, a former military commander, is virtually guaranteed to win a second term after all serious opposition pulled out of the race citing intimidation after a major challenger was jailed. 
The election commission says the vote will be free and fair and Sisi has said he wanted more candidates to run.
Sisi's critics say he has presided over an intensifying crackdown on dissent. Supporters say tough measures are needed to stabilize the country after years of unrest that followed a 2011 popular uprising.
A British Foreign Office spokeswoman said the foreign secretary had raised Trew's deportation with his Egyptian counterpart.
""The Egyptian authorities have not shared any evidence of wrongdoing. We will continue to press them on this case,"" she added.

The epicenter of Saturday's quake was located 180 kilometers (112 miles) southwest of Rabaul on New Britain island, some 900 km northeast of the capital Port Moresby, at a depth of 68 km (40 miles), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said. The quake was revised down from an initial reading of magnitude 6.8 and a depth of 60 km. 
""Based on all available data a destructive Pacific-wide tsunami is not expected,"" the Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said in a bulletin.
Quakes are common in Papua New Guinea, which sits on the Pacific's ""Ring of Fire"", a hotspot for seismic activity due to friction between tectonic plates. Rabaul lies in the shadow of Mount Tavurvur, an active volcano that destroyed the town in 1994 during a severe eruption. 
The latest quake comes as Papua New Guinea struggles to get aid to desperate survivors of the Feb. 26 quake, which flattened whole villages and spoiled water supplies on the country's main island. A month on, disaster and relief officials say the scale of the emergency is testing the finances and capacity of one of the world's poorest countries.
The impoverished country is also missing its largest revenue earner, after the quake forced a shutdown of  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) Corp's liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, which has annual sales of $3 billion at current LNG prices. The firm is still assessing quake damage at its facilities.

545,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2018 10:27AM ET</span>",Bomb kills two in Alexandria ahead of Egypt presidential vote,"CAIRO (Reuters) - A bomb placed under a car exploded in Egypt's second city Alexandria on Saturday, killing two people including a policeman, two days before the country is due to hold a presidential election.
The bombing, which wounded four other policemen, targeted Alexandria's security chief, police Major General Mostafa al-Nemr, the interior ministry said.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing. Islamic State released a video last month in which it warned Egyptians against taking part in the upcoming vote and urged Islamists to attack security forces and leaders.
State news agency MENA quoted Nemr as saying that two people, a policeman and a driver, were killed in the blast.
Photos on social media that Reuters could not independently verify showed a burnt out car and smoke at the site of the blast.
""On Saturday March 24 an explosive device planted underneath a car exploded ... as the Alexandria security chief drove by,"" the interior ministry said in a statement.
Eyewitnesses said police and military personnel formed a cordon around the site of the explosion. Local television stations later showed Nemr unharmed and inspecting the area. 
INSURGENCY
Islamic State attempted to assassinate Egypt's defense and interior ministers in December during a trip the pair made to the Sinai Peninsula, where the hardline militant group has been waging an insurgency for almost five years.
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Friday that Islamic State militants would soon be defeated in the Sinai as he visited troops battling the jihadists there.
Polls will open on Monday when voters choose between Sisi and one little-known candidate who supports the former field marshal. All credible opponents dropped out in January, citing intimidation by the authorities after the main challenger was jailed.
Sisi's critics say he has cracked down harshly on dissent and that tough economic reforms have eroded his popularity. Supporters say such measures are needed to stabilize Egypt, which was rocked by years of unrest after protests toppled veteran leader Hosni Mubarak in 2011.
As military commander, Sisi led the ousting of Egypt's only competitively-elected leader, President Mohamed Mursi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, who was toppled amid demonstrations against his rule in 2013, a year after taking power. Sisi took office with a landslide election victory a year later.
State news agency MENA blamed the Brotherhood, which is now banned in Egypt and designated a terrorist group, for Saturday's bombing.
""This attempt comes in the context of terrorist Muslim Brotherhood elements trying to disrupt the electoral process and influence citizens into not going to the polls and participating in the presidential election,"" the agency said.
Islamic State and other militant groups have successfully assassinated officials in recent years. Islamic State bombed a hotel in Sinai in 2015 during a parliamentary election, killing seven people including two judges overseeing the vote.

Egypt's top public prosecutor, Hisham Barakat, was killed by a car bomb in June 2015.

546,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2018 09:55AM ET</span>",Former Catalan leader faces arrest in Finland,"By Sam Edwards and Jussi Rosendahl
HELSINKI/BARCELONA, Spain (Reuters) - Former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont faces arrest in Finland after authorities there received an international warrant for his detention issued by Spain, the latest legal action against separatist politicians from the wealthy northeastern region.
If he returns to Spain, Puigdemont faces up to 25 years in prison on charges of rebellion and sedition for his part in organizing an illegal referendum on secession last year.
When police reach Puigdemont, a normal extradition process will begin, though they currently have no knowledge of his whereabouts, Finnish authorities said in a statement on Saturday.
In an interview with Spanish radio station Catalunya Radio earlier, Puigdemont’s lawyer, Jaume Alonso-Cuevillas, had said his client was prepared to present himself to Finnish police.
Puigdemont went into self-imposed exile in Belgium last year, shortly after the Catalan parliament made a symbolic declaration of independence from Spain. He arrived in Finland on Thursday to meet lawmakers and attend a conference.
On Friday, Spanish supreme court judge Pablo Llarena ruled a total of 25 separatist politicians, including Puigdemont, would face trial for rebellion, embezzlement or disobeying the state.
Of those, five were sent on Friday to pre-trial jail, among them Jordi Turull, a close ally of Puigdemont who was due to be put forward for a second vote on Saturday to become the next regional president.
With Turull in jail and unable to attend the session for which his presence is a requirement, Catalan parliament speaker Roger Torrent canceled the vote on Saturday, holding in its place a debate that at several points became heated and saw members of one opposition party abandon the chamber in protest.
Speaking after the debate, accompanied by various other heads of parties and in front of a crowd of supporters, Torrent described Madrid’s legal action as an “attack on the heart of democracy.”

“Locking up people for their political ideas and pursuing those that refuse to renounce them is to put an end to the freedom of political thought,” Torrent said, calling on Catalan politicians to form a broad coalition in opposition to Madrid’s actions.

547,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Hundreds of thousands set to march for tighter U.S. gun controls,"By Ian Simpson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of Americans are expected to rally nationwide on Saturday for tighter gun laws in ""March For Our Lives"" protests led by survivors of the Florida school massacre, which reiginited public anger over mass shootings.
Students from the Parkland, Florida, high school where 17 students and staff were killed on Feb. 14 will be among the 500,000 people organizers say could rally on Pennsylvania Avenue near the Capitol in Washington.
The protests orchestrated by survivors of the rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School are aimed at breaking through a legislative gridlock that has long stymied efforts to tighten firearms controls. Mass shootings at American schools and colleges have become a regular occurrence.
""This issue is going to turn into the No. 1 issue in this country. I know that's not only what I want, but I know it's what you guys want,"" Alfonso Calderon, a junior at the Florida school, told Washington students at a pre-march event on Thursday.
The Washington rally is among more than 800 events scheduled worldwide, with U.S. demonstrations set from San Clemente, California, to New York and Parkland, according to gun-control group Everytown For Gun Safety.
The teenage organizers have won kudos and cash from dozens of celebrities, with singer Ariana Grande and ""Hamilton"" creator Lin-Manuel Miranda among those performing in Washington.
""Trainwreck"" star Amy Schumer is set to appear at the Los Angeles rally. Actor George Clooney and his human rights attorney wife have donated $500,000 and said they would be at the Washington rally.
Organizers want Congress, many of whose members are up for re-election this year, to ban the sale of assault weapons like the one used in the Florida rampage and to tighten background checks for gun buyers. On the other side of the debate, gun rights advocates cite constitutional guarantees of the right to bear arms.
On Friday, Republican President Donald Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill that includes modest improvements to background checks for gun sales and grants to help schools prevent gun violence.
David Hogg, a senior at Stoneman Douglas, said the protests were a way for young Americans to show their opposition to the National Rifle Association, the powerful gun lobby.
""We're asking people (to) put the USA over the NRA,"" he said at the Thursday event in Washington.
An NRA spokeswoman said it had not taken a position on the protests.

Democrats and nonpartisan groups hope to register at least 25,000 first-time voters at the rallies, potentially a boost for Democrats, who generally favor stricter gun controls.

548,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2018 08:51AM ET</span>","As Syrian rebels quit Ghouta, Douma stands alone","BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian army paused its bombardment of Douma, the last rebel bastion near Damascus, after midnight, a war monitor said on Saturday, as insurgents prepared to leave the rest of their former enclave of eastern Ghouta. 
Thousands of fighters and their families departed neighboring Harasta by bus on Friday after a deal with the government to surrender the town. Insurgents in several other towns nearby have agreed to leave on similar terms. 
State television broadcast footage from a crossing point on Saturday where it said preparations had been completed for those rebels' departure to northwestern Syria. 
It showed trucks and bulldozers at a major highway intersection that for years was a front line and impassable to traffic. At one point, machinery was used to lift barricades under a road bridge. Soldiers walked around the area.
The army was advancing into towns the rebels had retreated from in preparation for their exit, state media said. 
It means only Douma is left of the opposition's eastern Ghouta enclave which a month ago the United Nations said was home to 400,000 people and constituted the rebels' main stronghold near Damascus. 
The army offensive to capture it, heralded by one of the heaviest bombardments in the seven-year war with warplanes, helicopters and artillery, has killed more than 1,600 people, said the war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. 
Residents and rights groups have accused the government of using weapons that kill indiscriminately - inaccurate barrel bombs dropped from helicopters, chlorine gas and incendiary material that sets raging fires.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his close ally Russia, which has helped his air campaign, have denied using all those weapons and say their offensive was needed to end the rule of Islamist militants over civilians. 
EVACUATION 
About 7,000 fighters, along with family members and other civilians who do not wish to come back under Assad's rule, were to leave the towns of Zamalka, Arbin, Ein Terma and Jobar starting on Saturday, rebels and state media said. 
They will go to Idlib province in the northwest - the destination for many such ""evacuations"" after sieges and ground offensives forced numerous rebel enclaves to surrender in the past two years. 
It will not mean an end to their experience of war. Syrian military and Russian air raids on Idlib have increased in the past week, killing dozens of people. 
Idlib is also unsettled by fighting between the rebel groups. On Saturday, an explosion at a headquarters for al Qaeda's former affiliate killed at least seven people and injured 25 others. 
The rebels leaving the eastern Ghouta towns will also release several thousand captured Syrian soldiers, state media reported. The Observatory said there were also negotiations with the Jaish al-Islam rebel group that controls Douma to release prisoners. 
Russia will guarantee that civilians who remain in the areas recaptured by Assad will not be prosecuted, rebels said on Friday. However, rights groups have said some men were forcibly conscripted after fleeing the fighting. 
A Russian military webcam at the al-Wafideen crossing point near Douma showed small groups of civilians continuing to flee the danger of further bombardment into government territory on Saturday, carrying children and sacks of belongings. 
Russia's military said on Saturday more than 105,000 people had left eastern Ghouta, including more than 700 on Saturday. 

Tens of thousands have fled their homes in the past week as the bombardment of Douma intensified and refugees from other parts of Ghouta found the basement bomb shelters already too full to take them in.

549,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2018 07:17AM ET</span>",French gendarme who took place of hostage dies of gunshot wounds,"By Brian Love and Emmanuel Jarry
PARIS (Reuters) - France was in mourning on Saturday for a French security officer who died from gunshot wounds after voluntarily taking the place of a female hostage during a supermarket siege by an Islamist militant.
Arnaud Beltrame, 44, a gendarme who once served in Iraq, had been raced to hospital fighting for his life after being shot by the gunman during the siege at the Super U store in the southwestern town of Trebes near the Pyrenees mountains.
""He fell as a hero, giving up his life to halt the murderous outfit of a jihadist terrorist,"" President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement shortly before dawn on Saturday.
Friday's attacker was identified by authorities as Redouane Lakdim, a 25-year-old Moroccan-born French national from the city of Carcassonne, not far from Trebes, a tranquil town of about 5,000 people where he struck on Friday afternoon.
Lakdim was known to authorities for drug-dealing and other petty crimes, but had also been under surveillance by security services in 2016-2017 for links to the radical Salafist movement, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said on Friday.
The attacker, whose rampage began when he fired on a group of police joggers and also shot the occupants of a car he stole, killed three people and injured 16 others on Friday, according to a government readout.
Beltrame's death takes the number killed to four.
He was part of a team of gendarmes who were among the first to arrive at the supermarket scene; most of the people in the supermarket escaped after hiding in a cold storage room and then fleeing through an emergency exit.
He offered to trade places with a hostage the attacker was still holding, whereafter he took her place and left his mobile phone on a table, line open. When shots rang out, elite police stormed the building to kill the assailant. Police sources said Beltrame was shot three times.
ARRESTS
Police arrested two people after the attack, one of them a woman connected to Lakdim, on Friday and a 17-year-old man said to be one of his friends overnight, judicial sources said.
The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for the attack. Macron said security services were checking that claim.
More than 240 people have been killed in France in attacks since 2015 by assailants who either pledged allegiance to Islamic State or were inspired by the ultra hardline group.
France is part of a group of countries whose warplanes have been bombing Islamic State strongholds in Iraq and Syria, where in recent months IS has lost much of a self-proclaimed ""caliphate"" of territory it seized in 2014.
One multiple attack by Islamist gunmen and suicide bombers killed 130 people in Paris in November 2015 while another killed close to 90 when a man ran a truck into partying crowds in the Riviera seaside city of Nice in July 2016. 
Beltrame, who is survived by his wife, was a qualified parachutist who served in Iraq in 2005. He also worked as part of the elite Republican Guard that protects the presidential Elysee Place offices and residence in Paris, Macron said.
Friday's assault was the first deadly Islamist attack in France since October 2017, when a man stabbed two young women to death in the port city of Marseille before soldiers killed him.
Several attacks over the past year or more have targeted police and soldiers deployed in big numbers to protect civilians and patrol sensitive spots such as airports and train stations.
Macron said of Beltrame: ""In offering himself as a hostage to the terrorist holed up in the Trebes supermarket, lieutenant colonel Beltrame saved the life of a civilian hostage, showing exceptional self-sacrifice and courage.""

The news of Beltrame's death was first announced France's interior minister, who said in a Twitter post: ""Dead for his country. France will never forget his heroism, bravery and sacrifice.""

550,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2018 05:17AM ET</span>",California police shooting of unarmed black man forcing look at policies,"By Sharon Bernstein and Alex Dobuzinskis
SACRAMENTO/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Did police tell an unarmed black man who they were before shooting him to death in a dark backyard in Sacramento, California? That question is forcing an examination of policies dictating when and how police identify themselves while encountering suspects. 
Two Sacramento police officers, responding to a report of someone shattering car windows, killed Stephon Alonzo Clark, 22, on Sunday in a hail of bullets.
Police video has shown the officers chasing Clark around the side of his grandparents' house, yelling ""Show me your hands"" and ""Gun"" before firing. Police said they believed Clark held a gun, but it turned out to be a mobile phone. 
The release of the video late on Wednesday sparked street protests. Clark's family, through their attorney Benjamin Crump, disputed the police account that Clark was breaking windows. 
Many protesters have said police did not appear to have identified themselves when they confronted Clark on that dark night as he stood in his grandparents' backyard. On the video, the officers cannot be heard saying they are police. 
""He (Clark) didn't make any threats against the police, there is no evidence he committed a crime, there was no warning from the police, there was no identification from the police,"" Crump said.
Crump represented the family of black teenager Michael Brown, whose shooting death in Ferguson, Missouri, by police in 2014 sparked nationwide protests.
Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg said this week that city officials would examine police protocol for how they identify themselves in such cases.
""I have a 21-year-old son and I never had to teach him the importance of holding his hands high if he is ever stopped by a police officer,"" Steinberg said Friday on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). ""No words can describe how it must feel for an African-American family who has to teach that lesson as a reality of growing up black."" 
Sacramento police guidelines posted on the department's website do not specify that officers must identify themselves when encountering suspects. Sacramento police spokeswoman Linda Matthew said she did not believe such a policy existed.
Jim Pasco, executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police, said that policies for departments vary across the country, but it would be impractical under such circumstances to expect officers to identify themselves.
""If you're in a chase and everybody's running, there isn't a lot of talking back and forth going on,"" he said.
The Sacramento shooting could lead some police departments to change their rules, but such policies can be difficult to follow in the heat of the moment, said Eugene O'Donnell, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City.
""It won't surprise me if some departments add some other specific rule after this, but the cops are already weighed down with rules,"" he said.
Sacramento police spokeswoman Matthew said Clark could have assumed police were in the area because a Sacramento County Sheriff's Department helicopter was circling overhead.
""The officers were in full uniform and the suspect fled from them,"" she said.
Investigators are looking into whether the officers, who were searching the neighborhood for several minutes for a suspect, announced to Clark that they were police, Matthew said.

""With this incident and with every incident we have, we always look for ways in which we can improve,"" Matthew said. ""However, this was very rapidly evolving.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has agreed to hold high-level talks with South Korea on March 29 at the border truce village of Panmunjom to prepare for a summit of their leaders planned for April, the South said on Saturday.
A team of three officials will be led by Ri Son Gwon, the chairman of North Korea's committee for the peaceful reunification of the country, the North told its neighbor early on Saturday, the South's Unification Ministry said.
""This morning, North Korea sent a message through a communication channel in Panmunjom agreeing to our suggestion made on the 22nd to hold high-level inter-Korea talks,"" the ministry said in a statement.
The stakes are higher for a potential summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and his North Korean counterpart that may take place by the end of May, however. 
Trump this week named John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations famed for his hawkish views on Pyongyang, to replace White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster.
Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on March 13, saying the two had disagreed over Iran and other foreign policy matters.
The Korean talks set for March 29 will precede musical performances in Pyongyang in early April by a group of South Korean singers making a reciprocal visit after the North sent performers to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
Artists of both nations will collaborate for a show on April 3, the South's Yonhap news agency said, citing an aide of President Moon Jae-in.

Moon plans to hold a summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un by the end of April.

LIMA (Reuters) - Until this week, Martin Vizcarra led a quiet life as Peru's ambassador to Canada, overseeing the two nations' friendly relations from Ottawa, the Canadian capital.
But Vizcarra also happened to be Peru's first vice president, and he will now swap stately dinners with diplomats for the scorched earth of Peru's presidency, after Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned this week under the pressure of graft allegations.
Vizcarra, 55, was sworn in as president of the Andean nation of 32 million people on Friday, promising to fight corruption ""at any cost"" and calling on lawmakers to end the acrimonious disputes that accompanied Kuczynski's downfall in one of region's most stable economies.
A tall and lanky civil engineer married to a schoolteacher, Vizcarra plunged into politics after seeing his native Moquegua, a small mining region in southern Peru, languish under corrupt local leaders and neglect from policymakers in Lima, the capital.
Inspired by his father, a local mayor, Vizcarra became governor of Moquegua in 2011 and made a name for himself as a good listener and level-headed leader in conflict-prone Peru, the world's No. 2 copper producer.
""He makes decisions when he has to make them, and reflects a lot before doing so,"" said Luis Marchese, the Peru manager for  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc.
Marchese credits Vizcarra with defusing opposition that threatened to derail the company's $3.3 billion proposed mine, Quellaveco. After 20 months of negotiations led by Vizcarra, the company and community leaders reached a deal that modified the project's water-use plan.
But Vizcarra now faces a much taller task. 
Kuczynski's epic battle with the opposition-controlled Congress and the far-reaching graft scandal over Odebrecht - a Brazilian builder that admitted to bribing officials in Peru for a decade - has sparked demands for new elections to purge a political class widely seen as corrupt.
""IN TOUCH WITH REALITY"" 
Vizcarra was in Quebec at a meet-and-greet with Peruvian expatriates on Wednesday when he heard that Kuczynski had resigned in the face of near-certain impeachment, a source close to Vizcarra said. He arrived in Lima after police fired tear gas at protesters marching against the political establishment.
Vizcarra's biggest asset might be his low profile.
He started to distance himself from the government last year as Kuczynski came under fire from the rightwing opposition party that controls Congress.
Unlike Kuczynski, a Princeton-trained former Wall Street banker, Vizcarra tends to watch the Sunday night news shows that often set the week's agenda in Peru and is a more shrewd politician than he appears, the source said.
In September, Vizcarra left Peru, choosing to be ambassador to low-key Canada instead of the United States to learn more about mining in the developed world, the source said.
""I don't know much about him,"" Anderson Vasquez, a Lima office worker said. ""But I'm hoping for the best. Peru looks bad to the rest of the world, and we need to get on with things.""
Kuczynski had promised to modernize Peru by the end of his scheduled term in 2021. Instead, bombshell revelations that he had financial ties with Odebrecht - despite repeated denials - put him in the opposition's crosshairs.
Kuczynski and Vizcarra share little in common. The two teamed up to launch an unlikely 2016 presidential ticket that combined Kuczynski's experience in international finance with Vizcarra's appeal as a Lima outsider.
But where Kuczynski is prone to gaffes and name dropping, Vizcarra's more modest style may be welcome in a country used to more formality from its leaders.

""Vizcarra's sensible and in touch with the reality of the country. That's the big difference"" with Kuczynski, said Peruvian political analyst Diethell Columbus.

553,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2018 04:13AM ET</span>",Trump moves to limit transgender individuals from military service,"By Idrees Ali and Eric Beech
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump signed a memorandum on Friday that bans some transgender individuals from serving in the U.S. military, but gives the armed forces latitude in implementing policies.
The memorandum said transgender individuals with a history of gender dysphoria, defined as ""those who may require substantial medical treatment, including through medical drugs or surgery,"" are disqualified from military service ""except under certain limited circumstances.""
It added that the secretaries of defense and homeland security ""may exercise their authority to implement any appropriate policies concerning military service by transgender individuals.""
The White House said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had found that individuals with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria presented a risk to military effectiveness.
""This new policy will enable the military to apply well-established mental and physical health standards ... equally to all individuals who want to join and fight for the best military force the world has ever seen,"" it said. 
The Democratic National Committee criticized the move as an insult to transgender service members. In a strongly-worded statement, U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said the policy would harm the nation.
""This latest memorandum is the same cowardly, disgusting ban the President announced last summer,"" she said. ""The President’s hateful ban is purpose-built to humiliate our brave transgender members of the military who serve with honor and dignity."" 
Trump's decision is less restrictive than his initial comments in a July Twitter message saying he would prohibit transgender people from military service. That blanket ban reversed former President Barack Obama’s policy. 
At the time, Trump said on Twitter, the military ""cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.""
However, a number of federal judges have already issued rulings blocking Trump's ban, saying it would probably violate the right, under the U.S. Constitution, to equal protection under the law.
On Friday, the Pentagon reaffirmed that it would continue to comply with federal law.
""(The Pentagon) will continue to assess and retain transgender service members,"" Pentagon spokesman Major David Eastburn said. 
In a February memorandum to the White House, made public on Friday, Mattis said transgender individuals with a history of gender dysphoria were disqualified from military service.
But he added that those currently serving could continue to serve if they had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria since Obama's policy took effect. 
Mattis also recommended that transgender individuals who require or have undergone gender transition be disqualified from military service.
""In my professional judgment, these policies will place the Department of Defense in the strongest position to protect the American people, to fight and win America's wars, and to ensure the survival and success of our service members around the world,"" Mattis wrote.
A court filing by the Trump administration said 8,980 service members reportedly identify as transgender, but only 937 active duty service members were diagnosed with gender dysphoria since June 30, 2016.
At least one openly transgender recruit has already signed a contract to join the U.S. military since a federal court ruled late last year that the military would have to accept transgender individuals. 
The Department of Justice said it would continue to defend the defense department's authority to create and implement personnel policies. 
""Consistent with this new policy, we are asking the courts to lift all related preliminary injunctions in order to ensure the safety and security of the American people and the best fighting force in the world,"" it said in a statement. 
Advocates have said they believe dozens, if not hundreds, of transgender people will seek to join those already serving.
The Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy group, condemned the Trump policy. 
""There is simply no way to spin it, the Trump-Pence administration is going all in on its discriminatory, unconstitutional and despicable ban on transgender troops,"" Chad Griffin, its president, said in a statement.

ACCRA (Reuters) - Ghana's parliament on Friday night ratified a deal granting ""unimpeded"" access to the United States to deploy troops and military equipment in the West African nation in a vote boycotted by the opposition, legislators said.
The Ghana-U.S. Military Cooperation agreement requires Ghana to provide unimpeded access to agreed facilities and areas to U.S. forces, their contractors and other related services.
It said facilities provided by Ghana shall be designated as either for exclusive use by U.S. troops or to be jointly used with their Ghanaian counterparts. ""Ghana shall also provide access to and use of a runway that meets the requirements of United States forces,"" it said.
The Americans will use Ghana's radio spectrum for free and will be exempted from paying taxes on equipment imported into Ghana, it said.
In return, the United States will this year invest around $20 million in training and equipment for the Ghanaian military. There will also be joint exercises.
The red-band-wearing opposition lawmakers boycotted the vote after failing to block approval, leaving behind only members of the ruling party to ratify it.
""We will not be part of the process to endorse this deal in its current form because it is not in our national interest,"" minority leader Haruna Iddrisu said amid banging of tables as both sides yelled at each other.
Ghana and the United State have strong diplomatic and trade ties, culminating in specific cooperation between their militaries in the past.
But critics, including some civil society groups, say this year's agreement amounted to mortgaging the country's sovereignty. While some called for its rejection, others wanted the terms overhauled.
""The agreement tells you that the army of another country will come into your town ... they'll import military equipment which even your security agencies can't inspect, let alone authorize,"" Srem Sai, a university lecturer, said.
""Forget about your tax authorities - they can't even levy and the army will operate the equipment and drive them in your streets without your licence. The laws of your country don’t apply to them,"" he added.
Scores of protesters who marched to parliament on Friday to persuade the lawmakers against the deal were blocked by police.

In 2007, Wu Ying was convicted of cheating investors out of 380 million yuan ($60 million) from May 2005 to January 2007 in lending scams. Two years later, she was sentenced to death. 
Wu amassed her fortune by promising investors high returns as she spent the money on a lavish lifestyle. 
Her case had sparked heated public debate over China's fundraising system, which outlaws all forms of private lending, though some thought the original sentence was too harsh. 
After a retrial in 2012, her sentence was reduced to death with a two-year reprieve. The sentence was then commuted to life imprisonment in 2014. 
The Zhejiang native opened a hair salon in 1997 and later became the president of her own investment firm Bense.

The placement came as leftist presidential frontrunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador threatens to scrap the airport and block new work on it. Slim's construction business has been one of the biggest winners of work for the airport.

Slim's Grupo Financiero Inbursa, through vehicles including pension fund Afore Inbursa, was allocated around 13 billion pesos of certificates of the trust created to finance part of the construction of the airport, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

557,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 06:00PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Comoros passport scheme was unlawful, abused by 'mafia' networks - report","By David Lewis and Ali Amir Ahmed
NAIROBI/MORONI (Reuters) - A programme to sell Comoros Islands citizenship to fund development resulted in thousands of passports being sold outside official channels via ""mafia"" networks and up to $100 million of revenues went missing, according to a report by the small Indian Ocean state's parliament. 
The report, produced by a parliamentary commission set up in June 2017 to investigate the citizenship programme, also said former presidents Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi and Ikililou Dhoinine, who were in power when the alleged abuses took place, were ""suspected of the embezzlement of public funds.""
The programme was flawed from its inception and the current Comoros government should seek international help to recover the missing funds and take officials involved to court, the report concluded.
In a video posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Sambi rejected all accusations against him, saying they had been fabricated to discredit him. He didn't respond to a request for further comment. 
Ikililou told Reuters by telephone that he could not comment on the report as he had not read it yet. Both men have previously said they believed the scheme would help develop the country, an archipelago off the east coast of Africa.
The report was completed in December but has not been publicly released. Reuters has reviewed a copy that was signed by Dhoihir Dhoulkamal, head of the commission and an independent member of parliament.
Abdallah Tocha Djohar, a Sambi supporter initially on the commission who later called for it to be disbanded, said the report had not been officially approved by the entire commission and its disclosure violated procedures relating to how the commission should operate.
The current Comoros government, led by President Azali Assoumani, has said it has suspended citizenship sales since coming to power in May 2016.
    
MISSING FUNDS
Nearly a decade ago, Comoros launched a programme with the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait to sell citizenship to stateless people in those countries, known as Bidoon, in return for cash to help develop the poor Indian Ocean archipelago. 
The scheme was dogged by controversy from the beginning, with some members of parliament and civil society saying the changes to Comoros law that allowed the sale of citizenship were made illegally.
The cross-party commission found that the law allowing the sale of citizenship was changed during a parliamentary session that violated its own procedures. The bill that was promulgated lacks the correct signatures and stamps, and does not officially figure on a list of laws passed by the National Assembly, the commission found.
Critics of the passport programme also called for more transparency over revenues from the Gulf after promised development projects failed to materialize. While most of the passports were sold to Bidoon, Comoros and Emirati officials said a number of passports had also been sold to other foreigners.
A Reuters investigation published last year found that two Iranians accused by the U.S. government of breaking sanctions were among those who bought Comoros passports via the networks that sold documents outside the official programme.
The parliamentary commission estimates that the overall sum of government revenues from the passport sales to have gone missing amounts to around 17 percent of the country's gross domestic product in one year.
The commission said that the secrecy of contracts, lack of documentation and variety of groups of officials involved in passport sales complicated efforts to establish how much money went missing.
However, by analyzing the number of passports issued without official approval and the shortfall in revenues from those sales that were approved, the commission estimated an overall revenue gap of about 43 billion Comoros francs ($100 million).
""The economic citizen programme generated significant financial resources. Sadly a big part of the funds generated never arrived in the state coffers,"" the report concluded.
The commission's report is due to be debated in parliament when the next session begins in April. A spokesman for Assoumani said that the president had not yet received a copy but the president would analyze the findings.
""If some people are found to have embezzled money or broken the law, there is no doubt that steps will be taken to establish who is responsible,"" Mohamed Ismaella, Assoumani's spokesman, said.
    
""TACIT COMPLICITY""
According to Comoros law, sales of citizenship to a foreigner must be authorized by the president. 
The commission said that a database showed that nearly 48,000 foreigners – including mostly Bidoons - received passports, about 6,000 more than the official number approved by the president, highlighting the scale of sales outside the official channels. 
The high volume of passports being issued meant that the top Comoros security official’s signature was scanned and shared on the government's computer system, scrapping the need for him to manually sign off on each individual document, according to the report.
Three former interior ministers and two former intelligence chiefs told the commission said that the set up allowed for passports to be produced without the relevant Comoros authorities always being aware. 
""This allowed for the emergence of parallel mafia networks selling Comoros passports,"" the report said. ""The at least tacit complicity of authorities at the highest levels with the parallel networks inside and outside the country has turned the Comoros passport into a product advertised for sale on the international market.""
The report did not say which possible mafia networks it referred to.
The first phase of the scheme, under Sambi, who was in power from 2006 to 2011, was meant to earn Comoros $200 million in return for giving citizenship to 4,000 stateless families. Emirati officials told the commission they had paid the money in full but the report said there was little trace of the money in Comoros public accounts.
“The serious accusations leveled against me by the parliamentary commission of enquiry are baseless,” Sambi said in statements made in the local Comorian language and posted on Facebook.
After a brief suspension, the scheme was continued by Dhoinine in 2011. A new agreement set the price of a passport at 4,600 euros, and said a minimum of 5,000 passports would be issued.

BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Thousands of Slovaks rallied in Bratislava and other towns for a fourth consecutive Friday over the murder of an investigative journalist, although numbers were sharply lower after veteran prime minister Robert Fico was forced to quit.
Some protestors repeated demands for new elections despite Fico's departure following the shooting of Jan Kuciak, 27, who probed fraud cases involving businessmen with political ties, and his fiancée last month.
Fico resigned last week but the existing three-party coalition has been reformed under a new prime minister, meaning no new elections are being held.
On Friday the crowd in Bratislava staged a largely silent vigil for Kuciak rather than a noisy protest as before, and the newspaper Dennik N estimated its size at around 25,000, half the figure for last week's demonstration.
Some protestors said they respected the constitution after President Andrej Kiska appointed a new government under Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini on Thursday to keep the coalition afloat midway through its term.
But Fico remains leader of Pellegrini's Smer party, the biggest group in the government.
Other Slovaks are disappointed that no early elections have been held. They see the reshuffle, that saw former health minister Tomas Drucker replace unpopular interior minister Robert Kalinak, as insufficient to safeguard a fair investigation of Kuciak's murder while Smer, often a target of the reporter's investigative journalism, remains in power. 
""There are serious allegations that government officials not only had ties with organized crime but were directly involved in it, systematically ripping off our country,"" human rights activist Zuzana Kriskova said at the Bratislava vigil. 
The crowd occasionally erupted into chants demanding early elections and, after singing the national anthem, several thousand marched towards the parliament. They demanded the resignation of Slovakia's police chief, also a subject of Kuciak's reporting, over his perceived conflict of interest. 
No clashes were reported.
Kiska said on Thursday he had agreed with Drucker that the leadership of the Slovak police force must be replaced to help win back public trust.
The new government is likely to sail through a confidence vote next week in the 150-member parliament, where the coalition has a majority with 79 lawmakers.
Kuciak, who was found with fiancée Martina Kusnirova in their home outside Bratislava, had been looking into suspected mafia links of Italians with businesses in Slovakia.
In his final report, published posthumously, he said one of the Italians, currently in custody for suspected drug trafficking, had past business links with two Slovaks who later worked in Fico's office. Both have resigned but deny any connection with the murder. Their Italian former business partner has denied having connections with the mafia.
No one has been charged with the murder so far.
Fico was prime minister for 10 of the last 12 years. He positioned the euro zone country as a pro-European bastion in a eurosceptic region, avoiding the clashes Hungary and Poland have had with the EU over media freedom and the rule of law.

Pellegrini vowed to maintain his pro-European course.

GUADALAJARA, Mexico (Reuters) - The leftist front-runner for the Mexican presidency softened his critical stance on Mexico City's $13 billion new airport on Friday, saying he would carefully review the project, instead of threatening to scrap it entirely. 
Speaking in the central city of Guadalajara, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has led polls for months ahead of the July 1 election, stressed the need to examine all aspects of the project, which is already under construction.
""We are going to do a technical review of the project, without scaring anyone,"" he said at a construction industry conference in Mexico's second-biggest city.
""(Hold) a review, with all honesty as to whether it goes ahead or it doesn't; those are the options,"" he added.
Lopez Obrador proposed assembling a team of 15 experts to assess the project - five from the construction industry, five from the government and five from his team.
It was a more conciliatory stance than his remarks on Thursday, when he said his legal team would file injunctions to block the government from awarding more work contracts for the project, which he slammed as ""corrupt.""
His pick for communications and transport minister, Javier Jimenez Espriu, told the conference that if elected, Lopez Obrador would suspend work to conduct a financial, environmental and technical review to assess the project's full impact.
Contracts worth billions of dollars have already been awarded for the airport, which aims to ease the strained capacity of the capital's present hub and improve connectivity.
The largest existing contract went to a consortium that includes a construction company controlled by Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim, one of the world's richest men.
The project is the biggest public works project underway in Mexico. The planned terminal building was designed by British architect Norman Foster and Slim's son-in-law, Fernando Romero.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - With Brexit a year away, European Union leaders made a point on Friday of embracing Theresa May, with some treating her troubles with Russia and the United States as an opportunity to show Britain who its friends are.
The prime minister won a display of continental solidarity in her push to punish Moscow for the nerve agent attack in Salisbury. It surprised some British officials and contrasted sharply with the past two years of frosty summitry since Britons voted to quit the bloc and seek a better global role alone.
Summit chair Donald Tusk, so often a prophet of doom for Britain's prospects after Brexit, hailed the warm atmosphere: 
""In these difficult circumstances, I am personally especially pleased that, despite the tough Brexit negotiations, the European Union has demonstrated unanimous and unequivocal unity with the UK in the face of this attack,"" he said. 
British hopes of closer bilateral relations with its similarly free-trading former colonies have been challenged by fears of a trade war with Washington. President Donald Trump has slapped new tariffs on steel imports, but offered respite on Friday to the EU after a fierce collective response from Brussels.
May made a point of staying in Brussels overnight in order to join the 27 remaining EU leaders in a joint affirmation of their belief in free trade, reminding voters back home that blocking U.S. tariff barriers was in the interest of British steelworkers.
Elsewhere in Europe, Norway's important metals exporters got less comfort than May. Outside the European Union, Oslo was left complaining that it was not covered by Trump's exemption order.
May's peers, who after her departure confirmed their plan to give Britain an ""ambitious"" post-Brexit free trade pact, hoped she took away a message from a summit for once dominated by external challenges rather than Brexit.
""In a perverse way, Russia and the United States help us,"" said one senior EU diplomat hoping to keep the British close.
""Britain has a chance to see who their real friends are.""
Few believe the British can be persuaded to change their minds on membership before March next year - though some would like that. But the approach of that deadline prompted some summiteers into wistful musings on what they saw as the ironies of Brexit.
""With the state of the world today, from Trump to Putin,"" said a second EU diplomat, ""this summit shows again what madness Brexit is.""
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, one of May's closest allies on the continent, summed up the mood of regret: 
""It's so strange, isn't it, that when this is going on in the world, Salisbury, the situation with the United States, and we are all standing together in solidarity ... that we now have to talk about the departure of the United Kingdom from the EU.

""Bizarre.""

The modification of a rule made by Zuma is fresh evidence of Ramaphosa's determination to follow through on a pledge to crack down on graft. Ramaphosa was elected by parliament to succeed Zuma in February in part on his pledge to curb corruption.
Zuma signed the clause on Feb. 8 as part of a list of regulations before he stepped down from office.
The regulations govern an inquiry into allegations that Zuma's friends, the businessmen and brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, influenced the appointment of ministers and the award of contracts by state firms.
Zuma and the Guptas have denied any wrongdoing.
Civil rights group AfriForum filed an application at South Africa's highest court, the Constitutional Court, to quash the rule signed by Zuma, which it termed ""unconstitutional"".
The rights group said the clause, as signed by Zuma, would mean that no evidence regarding the questions and answers in the inquiry will be admissible if there are subsequent criminal proceedings. It said this would turn the commission of inquiry into an amnesty tribunal.
In a statement on Friday, the president's office said Ramaphosa had amended the rule in response to petitions filed by AfriForum and other rights groups.
Zuma lost support within the ruling African National Congress because of the allegations and they remain politically potent even though he has stepped down.
Conducting a credible inquiry is seen by many as a litmus test of Ramaphosa's ability to pursue broader reforms in his bid to revive the country's economy.
Ramaphosa re-wrote the clause, limiting the inadmissibility of any evidence to circumstances where a witness may incriminate themselves.
AfriForum said following it would drop its case following Ramaphosa's amendment of the rule.
""We won't be proceeding with the case,"" AfriForum's spokesman Willie Spies said.

Zuma, 75, announced in January that he would set up the commission into influence-peddling, which has become known as ""state capture"" in South Africa, after he was ordered to do so within 30 days of a High Court ruling in December.

563,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 05:49PM ET</span>",Thousands join 'Black Friday' marches against Polish abortion restrictions,"By Anna Koper and Marcin Goettig
WARSAW (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Poles dressed in black protested across the country on Friday against an attempt by the ruling conservatives and the powerful Catholic Church to ban most abortions.
The ""Stop Abortion"" draft bill, opposed by numerous rights groups, would remove the main legal recourse Polish women have for getting a termination in a country that already has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the European Union.
""I am against treating woman as an inferior type of human being,"" Malgorzata, 58, a psychologist who joined the ""Black Friday"" protest in Warsaw told Reuters. ""I support women's rights to decide about their bodies and their lives.""
Under current rules, abortion is allowed in three circumstances -- danger to the mother's health, rape or incest, and when prenatal tests show serious, irreversible damage to the foetus. 
The bill, already approved for further debate by the lower chamber of parliament in January and by a parliamentary committee earlier this week, would remove the third category, which currently covers more than 90 percent of legal abortions. 
It is the second bid by the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party to tighten abortion rules. In 2016, after about 100,000 people joined protests and support for PiS declined, the party rejected a bill that would have imposed a near-total ban. 
HEALTH, RIGHTS
Several thousand protesters gathered near the parliament building in Warsaw, with banners reading: ""Woman is a Human Being Not an Incubator"" and ""We Are Going after Law and Justice"". 
The protesters chanted ""freedom of choice instead of terror"".
A Warsaw city spokesman said about 55,000 people took part in the protest in the capital, the largest one in the country. Police gave a lower estimate at 20,000. Thousands of people participated in other major cities.
A group of U.N. human rights experts called on parliament to reject the bill, saying it risked causing serious damage to women's health.
""Preventing women from accessing safe and legal abortion care jeopardises their human rights,"" Nils Muiznieks of the Council of Europe human rights group said.
In Poland, causing the death of a foetus -- apart from cases where is it legal -- carries a penalty of up to two years in prison. Women that have terminations are not penalised.
A survey conducted by IBRiS pollster in January showed that 70 percent of Poles are against the proposed restriction. 
But after the 2016 setback for anti-abortion campaigners, PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said his party would strive to amend laws to make sure that even severely deformed foetuses were born so they could be ""baptised, buried, and be given a name"".
Polish Catholic bishops called in March on lawmakers to show ""unconditional respect for every human being in all moments of its existence"".
The PiS party has close ties to the Catholic Church and depends on its support in elections.
Jerzy Kowalewski, a 70-year-old retired sociologist, said the protest was an opportunity to express his opposition to the PiS government.

""(The abortion issue) is a political calculation. PiS wants to curry favours with the Catholic Church,"" he said. ""If they say abortion is murder, why not punish it like murder, with 25-year prison terms.”

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Friday that his first term in office had strengthened the state, and defended his tough austerity measures days ahead of a re-election vote in which the former military commander faces no serious opposition.
Sisi also said Islamic State militants would soon be defeated in the Sinai Peninsula as he visited troops battling the jihadists in a wide campaign there.
Polls will open on Monday when voters choose between Sisi and one little-known candidate who supports the former field marshal. All credible opponents dropped out in January citing intimidation by the authorities after the main challenger was jailed.
Sisi's critics say he has cracked down harshly on dissent and that tough economic reforms have eroded his popularity. Supporters say such measures are needed to stabilize Egypt, which was rocked by years of unrest after protests toppled veteran leader Hosni Mubarak in 2011.
As military commander Sisi led the ouster of Egypt's only competitively-elected leader, President Mohamed Mursi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood who was toppled amid demonstrations against his rule in 2013 a year after taking power. Sisi took office with a landslide election victory a year later.
""The last four years have been a phase to strengthen the Egyptian state and its institutions, and build up a strong infrastructure,"" Sisi said in a televised address to troops during his Friday visit to an air base in North Sinai.
""The economic measures carried out have been part of that consolidation of the state. I want to say to you that we are suffering, but that suffering is nothing compared to the collapse of the state,"" he said, wearing military uniform.
Sisi was filmed sitting, chatting and eating with troops.
""God willing, we will come (here) to celebrate a total victory over the deviants of the age ... do no hesitate to use all force against them,"" he said, referring to Sinai militants.
Last November Sisi ordered the armed forces to crush Islamic State after an attack on a mosque that killed more than 300 people, the deadliest such incident in Egypt's history.
Egypt's military launched its most publicized operation yet last month against the jihadists, who have waged years of attacks on the police and troops in North Sinai.
SINAI ATTACKS
The military says its current operation in Sinai has featured unprecedented coordination between the army, navy and air force. However, analysts and diplomats say they have seen little evidence of new tactics that would clear North Sinai of the militants.
Residents in the impoverished desert region of North Sinai have in recent years been displaced by fighting and by the clearing of large populated areas to create buffer zones.
The militants in Sinai intensified their attacks after the ouster of Mursi. Authorities have arrested hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood supporters since Sisi swept to office in 2014 on promises of restoring security in Egypt.
Sisi is effectively guaranteed next week to win a second four-year term, with voters hoping he can improve Egypt's struggling economy.
Sisi has said he wanted more candidates to run for office, and the election commission says the vote will be free and fair.

The International Monetary Fund, which agreed a $12 billion loan with Egypt in late 2016, has praised the government's austerity measures and a devaluation of the pound currency, saying they have improved some economic indicators, though many Egyptians still feel worse off.

BELGRADE (Reuters) - Preparations for a historic handball match between political adversaries Serbia and Kosovo ended in chaos on Friday with the expulsion of the host nation after it canceled the fixture over security concerns.
The women’s Under-20 World Championship qualifier would have been the first documented sporting encounter between Serbia and its former province, which declared independence in 2008 and which Belgrade does not recognize as a nation state.
But Serbia's Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic ordered the match to be scrapped over security concerns, a day after dozens of chanting youths carrying flares and national flags gathered outside the match venue.
The European Handball Federation (EHF) had arranged the game, part of a four-team event, in consultation with Serbian authorities.
In light of Friday's cancellation - which Kosovo's Deputy Prime Minister Enver Hoxhaj called ""unthinkable"" - it was expelling the Serbian team from the tournament, the EHF said in a statement.
It said it expected the other matches to go ahead as scheduled. 
But late on Friday the interior ministry said it had also canceled matches between Kosovo and Norway and Kosovo and Slovakia.
Stefanovic earlier suggested, in comments to news web site B92, that the government had been an unwilling participant.
Could we have organized for this match to go ahead? Certainly. But at what cost?,"" he was quoted as saying. ""We are not ready to have the police beat up people for the sake of a match which contradicts all our positions.""
He later told Belgrade Pink TV: ""Kosovo is an integral part of our country. It would have been impossible to let this fixture go ahead without clashes and chaos.""
The European Union has made Serbia committing to stable relations with Kosovo a prerequisite for membership of the bloc, and the country's presidents, Aleksandar Vucic and Hashim Thaci, met in Brussels on Thursday for a fresh round of EU-sponsored talks. 
But Belgrade continues to refuse to recognize Pristina institutions and has attempted to prevent Kosovo from joining international organizations, including sports associations. 
Kosovo declared independence almost a decade after a NATO bombing campaign ended a crackdown by Serbian authorities against secessionists among its majority ethic Albanian population. 
The handball match was scheduled for 1500 GMT at Kovilovo, an isolated sports complex on the outskirts of the capital where it had been moved from the central city of Kragujevac for safety reasons.
The Serbian Handball Federation (RSS) had ordered the whole tournament to be played behind closed doors, with no fans or media present, saying it acted in line with instructions from the EHF.

The winner of the tournament - should it end up being played - will qualify for the July 1-15 World Championship in Hungary.

In a mark of how weeks of grumbling in Brussels have brought the issue of Martin Selmayr's surprise appointment last month to the attention of European Union's national governments, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron faced questions about it at a joint summit news conference.
European Commission President Juncker, the former Luxembourg premier, dismissed reports he threatened to resign if parliament tried to reverse the appointment of his German chief-of-staff as the Commission's secretary-general. A parliamentary committee is due on Tuesday to review whether correct procedure was followed.
""As Mr. Selmayr will not step down because I am the only one capable to ask him to step down, the other question is irrelevant,"" Juncker told a reporter who asked if he might quit.
Some criticism has been fueled by the fact that Selmayr, 47, has irritated other senior officials and politicians in his role as Juncker's lieutenant, though he also has admirers. 
Some of the complaints have also focused on the fact his role, replacing a Dutchman, may increase influence for Berlin and for Merkel's center-right Christian Democrats in Brussels -- though Selmayr is not regarded as close to the chancellor.
""Anyone who believes that because he is German he always acts in the interests of Germany, we don't have this impression. He takes very European decisions,"" Merkel said on Friday, adding that she was pleased that his appointment was being reviewed.
However, she praised his ""efficiency"" and said: ""I very much appreciate the work of Martin Selmayr.""
Macron, too, offered his personal backing and cautioned against the European Union ""beating itself up"" over questions of the transparency of an appointment when other countries had much bigger problems. Nonetheless, he said the hearings in parliament must run their course: 
""I have always appreciated the professionalism of this person. His abilities should not be questioned,"" Macron said. ""He is very competent and knows Europe well.""

Many in the European Parliament agree with that assessment but even Juncker and Selmayr's own center-right allies complained during a debate earlier this month that the fast-track appointment risked damaging the EU's image at a time when euroskeptics have been buoyed by Britain's vote to leave.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, which went off outside the match venue in the provincial capital Lashkar Gah and in front of a crowd that included the Helmand governor and local lawmakers.
The governor's spokesman said the driver of the car detonated his bomb after he was prevented from entering the venue.
The Taliban controls large areas of Helmand, source of much of Afghanistan's opium crop. But government forces, backed by heavy U.S. air strikes, have succeeded in preventing Lashkar Gah from falling and have made advances in some districts.
The city, which came under serious threat from the insurgents last year, had been relatively quiet in recent months following offensives by security forces.
However Friday's attack, which followed a suicide blast in Kabul on Wednesday that was claimed by Islamic State, underlined the continued threat of violence across much of Afghanistan with the approach of spring, when fighting tends to pick up.
President Ashraf Ghani has offered to hold peace talks with the Taliban but there has so far been little sign the insurgents are willing to end their fight to drive out foreign forces and reestablish their version of strict Islamic law.

Ahmed Hassan was found guilty last week of trying to murder passengers on an underground train heading to central London on Sept. 15. Police it was only luck that his device, packed with shrapnel, did not properly detonate.
At London's Old Bailey Court, he was sentenced to life in prison and told he would spend at least 34 years behind bars.
""You were determined to create as much death and carnage that day as possible,"" said the judge, Charles Haddon-Cave.
""I am satisfied that you were driven and motivated by four things: a mind-set of ISIS (Islamic State) extremism, a deep-seated hatred of this country, a desire for revenge against Britain and America whom you blamed for your father's death in Iraq and anger at the continued bombing of Iraq by Western Coalition forces.""
The Iraqi, who the judge said was older than his given age of 18 but younger than 21, came to Britain illegally in 2015 and told officials he had spent three months in an ISIS training camp.
He was a model student, winning a prize for ""student of the year"" at his local college, but the judge said he harbored ""dark thoughts"" although only began researching his attack just a month before he carried it out.
On the day of the bombing, the teenager left his foster home in Sunbury-on-Thames, southwest of London, and headed for the local station with his bomb placed in a bucket and hidden in a supermarket shopping bag.
It was made with the highly volatile triacetone triperoxide (TATP) - known as ""the mother of Satan"" - and packed with more than 2 kg of metal shrapnel including screws, bolts, nails, knives and screwdrivers.
The device went off at Parsons Green station in Fulham, where flames engulfed the carriage with 93 people on board but because it did not fully explode, injuries were limited. Authorities said it was Britain's fifth major attack of 2017.
He had got off at the previous stop and the following day was arrested in the southern port of Dover where he had been trying to flee abroad.
Hassan, who had denied the charges, admitted to police he had made the bomb but said he had never intended to kill and merely wanted attention. 
""You should understand that the Koran is a book of peace; Islam is a religion of peace,"" Haddon-Cave told him.

COSHQUIN, Northern Ireland, March 23 (Reuters) - Gordon Crockett does not wish to suffer the same fate as his great-great grandfather, who began farming near the northernmost tip of Ireland before a border was ever erected on the island.
The Crockett family farm was cut in two when Ireland won independence from Britain in 1921 and the island was partitioned.
""Before partition he used to milk cows but as soon as the partition came the custom men were standing across the field and told him 'That's the last time you bring cows across the border',"" said Gordon, the fifth generation of farmer in the family.
Like many along the 500 km (310 mile) frontier that remains one of the most intractable issues in Britain's negotiations to leave the European Union, the Crockett's farm lies in both the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, straddling the counties of Donegal and Londonderry.
""At the minute there is no real problem, you can cross the border as free as you want. We could cross it six or eight times a day,"" the beef, sheep and cereal farmer said.
""If there was any sort of obstruction it would slow down our work every day.""
London and Dublin are committed to keeping the free flow of goods without returning to the kind of checkpoint that once operated below the Crockett's field. But agreeing a practical solution post-Brexit has proved elusive so far.
A hundred kilometers away in the southern border town of Clones, Brian Adamson has nothing but bad memories of the border which was transformed by a 1998 peace deal that ended Northern Ireland's 'Troubles' and by the creation of the EU's Single Market that removed barriers to trade among members.
""I hated going through the border because you got enormous hassle, you could be there for 10 minutes or you could be there for two hours. If they didn't like you, it'd be two hours,"" said Adamson who moved from Dublin 36 years ago and opened a pub in the town during the three decades of violence across the border.
""I live a mile and a half out the road and when I'm traveling home I have to cross the border twice. Things are grand as they are and I don't understand why they wouldn't leave it as it is.""
NORMAL LIFE
The end of customs checks was central to the establishment of an all-island economy. A recent study by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) highlighted a ""considerable"" level of supply chain interconnectedness that followed.
While Northern Ireland trades mostly with the rest of the UK, the report found that it is the complexities of this integration that could make disruption so damaging.
While fewer than one in five Irish firms surveyed were two-way, cross border traders, they accounted for more than 60 percent of the country's exports to the British province and over 70 percent of its imports in 2015.
For Seamus McQuaid, who wholesales into the south from his autoparts garage just inside the Northern border, the possible imposition of tariffs post-Brexit would mean having to set up a company 200 meters down the road to serve the same customers.
Yet it's also the simple things that could change. The current seamless border means neighbors from the south also use McQuaid's garage to save on expensive postage costs by having their Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or eBay orders delivered to his UK address.
""I don't mind that at all, as long as it's locals,"" he said.
The removal of checks has also helped revitalize parts of the border, most strikingly in places like Mullan, a village in the southern county of Monaghan, whose one street ends exactly at the border with Northern Ireland.
The bridge linking it to the north was blown up by security forces during the 'Troubles' to prevent smuggling and unwanted crossings, rendering the town a dead end. Most people left.
""When I came back, this would have been somewhere you would have driven through and have been quite sad. It was a decrepit looking village,"" said Brenda McGinn, whose Busy Bee Ceramics is one of a handful of enterprises restoring life to the community. 
""Now this is a revitalized, old hidden village.""
But like many who just want normal to continue, the locals in Mullan and elsewhere fear some of that progress could be lost as Brexit negotiations over their day-to-day lives come to a head in the coming months.
""It's the last chapter that counts,"" said Tom Parkes, who owns a farm on a former customs post in the tiny Northern Irish village of Middletown. 

""Where we finish up at the end of the day. That's what matters.""

WARSAW (Reuters) - Concessions in judicial reforms planned by Poland's ruling party are aimed at signaling to the European Commission that a compromise with Warsaw is possible, but will preserve the most important part of the reforms, the Polish prime minister said.
On Thursday, the Polish Law and Justice (PiS) party presented plans to change some elements of its judicial reforms in response to European Commission criticism that they threaten to undermine the rule of law. 
The right-wing Polish government and the European Commission have been at loggerheads for two years changes to the judicial system that the EU executive believes undermine the rule of law by placing more government control over judges.
Warsaw, which says the changes were necessary to push aside judges left over from the Communist era, had for months declined to make any concessions to Brussels.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Friday he wanted ""the essence, most important elements of the reform to remain untouched, but at the same time we are looking at what would allow the other side to say 'Oh, one can reach a compromise with Poland.'""
The Commission has threatened to punish Poland, including by suspending Warsaw's vote at the EU, if it does not withdraw changes that Brussels said ultimately threatened democracy.
Under the original judicial overhaul, the justice minister was given the power to fire court presidents without providing justification and subject to no review. The concessions now proposed by the PiS would require the justice minister first to seek the opinion of judges.
Warsaw would publish unreleased constitutional tribunal verdicts, which had ruled against the appointment of three judges nominated by PiS to the tribunal. The PiS has said those rulings were not valid because they were overturned by new laws.
It would also equalize the retirement age of female and male judges at 65 years, raising a 60 year limit for women.
The Polish opposition has criticized the concessions as not going far enough.
Morawiecki said it was too early to say if the concessions planned by PiS were sufficient to win over Brussels. The proposals ""were indeed received very positively"" by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Morawiecki said.
""But it would be premature to say today what the final reaction of the president will be,"" Morawiecki said. ""For sure his wise perception, his compromise-seeking attitude may be very helpful here,"" the Polish premier said.

A spokeswoman for the European Commission said on Friday the EU executive arm will analyze the Polish plan amendments.

All three parties in the election support Berdymukhamedov, 60, who has run the former Soviet republic since 2007 tolerating no dissent and the 125-seat parliament mainly rubber-stamps laws proposed by the president who is also the head of cabinet.
However, the upcoming election may prompt a reshuffle among senior MPs and ultimately give Serdar Berdymukhamedov, the president's only son, a bigger role, possibly that of speaker or deputy speaker.
Serdar Berdymukhamedov, 36, became a parliament deputy in a by-election in 2016 after holding several mid-level government jobs.
Since then, he has become a committee head and made a number of foreign visits, including one to neighboring Kazakhstan this month which underscored his special status.
Under the Turkmen constitution, the speaker becomes acting president if the head of state becomes unable to carry out his work.
Serdar Berdymukhamedov has trained as agricultural engineer and later studied diplomacy in Russia and Switzerland, skills which he put to use during his work at the foreign ministry.
His father is the center of an elaborate personality cult and is commonly referred to as Arkadag, or protector, who in official parlance is overseeing an ""era of might and happiness"".
Turkmenistan's economy depends heavily on exports of natural gas and came under stress after Russia, once the biggest buyer, halted all purchases of Turkmen gas in 2016.
Its main customer now is China and the Ashgabat government is building a new pipeline through Afghanistan to Pakistan and China in an attempt to open up new export markets.

For ordinary Turkmens, lower export revenues have manifested themselves in foreign currency shortages and foreign exchange restrictions. The black market flourished as a result, where the Turkmen manat currency trades at less than a third of its official value.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru First Vice President and ambassador to Canada Martin Vizcarra called for ""faith and optimism"" upon arriving at Lima's airport before dawn on Friday, ahead of being sworn in as president to replace outgoing Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who resigned over graft allegations.
Crowds of cheering supporters greeted Vizcarra when he landed on a commercial flight from Toronto.
""Faith and optimism!"" a smiling Vizcarra said before hoisting up a red-and-white jersey of Peru's soccer team given to him by a supporter. ""Peru can always overcome.""
Vizcarra is expected to be sworn in at around midday, taking the reins of a nation that has been rocked by a sprawling corruption scandal involving Brazilian builder Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] and a bitter feud between Kuczynski and the opposition-run Congress.
In a sign of the lingering political hostilities, Kuczynski threatened to upend Vizcarra's planned swearing-in ceremony after opposition lawmakers proposed a resolution to accept his resignation while also declaring they were impeaching him for being a ""traitor.""
""If it remains that way, I'll withdraw my (resignation) letter and submit myself to a proper impeachment process where I can exercise my defense,"" Kuczynski said on Twitter.
It was unclear if Kuczynski could legally withdraw his resignation.
The president of Congress, Luis Galarreta, said the resolution was only a draft.
Vizcarra, who turned 55 on Thursday and will be tasked with governing Peru through 2021, will have to repair relations with Congress while also restoring trust in the country's institutions after the Odebrecht scandal tainted most of Peru's political class.
The company once had an outsized presence in Peru's construction sector and admitted in late 2016 that it had bribed officials in Peru over a period spanning three presidencies.
Thousands of protesters and several leftist leaders marched in downtown Lima hours before Vizcarra arrived, demanding early elections and chanting ""out with them all!"" The demonstrations ended with police firing tear gas at protesters.
A former governor of a small mining region, Vizcarra is widely expected to continue the free market policies that have been in place for decades in Peru, the world's No. 2 copper producer and one of Latin America's most stable economies.
But he has yet to speak about what his government would look like, or what he thinks about the graft allegations that ensnared Kuczynski.
Kuczynski, a former Wall Street banker who took office less than two years ago, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and has blamed his fall on a campaign to malign him by the opposition party led by his campaign rival, twice-defeated presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori. [nL1N1R314F]
Sources close to Vizcarra told Reuters on Thursday that he plans to replace the country's prime minister, one of Kuczynski's most vocal cheerleaders, in a bid to form a consensus government with input from a broad representation of political groups and institutions. [nL1N1R4252] 

Vizcarra is expected to deliver a speech before Congress after he takes office.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari met 107 schoolgirls on Friday freed by Islamist militant group Boko Haram and promised to secure the release any of their classmates still held in the remote northeast.
Their kidnapping in the town of Dapchi hit Buhari politically by undermining his claims a year before an election to have ended Boko Haram's nearly decade-long insurgency.
A 2015 military campaign drove the group from most of the territory it controlled but much of the northeast remains beyond government rule and insurgents still stage attacks from strongholds near Lake Chad.
""This cheering and hearty development signifies our commitment to the security and well-being of all Nigerians,"" Buhari said after posing in Abuja for a group photograph with the girls, who spent a month in Boko Haram captivity.
The mass abduction from the girls' school was an apparent copycat of the 2014 abduction of 270 girls from the town of Chibok.
Boko Haram fighters stunned residents of Dapchi on Wednesday when they drove a line of trucks into the town and released the girls, triggering tears and ululations of joy from relatives.
The fighters, who were shouting ""God is greatest"" in Arabic, gave no reason for their change of heart. The government said it had secured their release ""through back-channel efforts and with the help of some friends of the country"".
It said no ransom was paid.
Buhari's administration agreed to pay millions of euros to secure the release of some of the Chibok girls, as well as ransoms for kidnapped university staff, after negotiations with Boko Haram aided by Switzerland and the Red Cross.
The kidnapping of the Dapchi schoolgirls may have been carried out by a Boko Haram faction allied to Islamic State in the hope of securing a similar payout, according to one person briefed on the incident.
The freed girls said they had been treated well but said five of the group had died during their time in captivity and one girl had not been released.
Buhari pledged to continue to work for her freedom, as well as that of the remaining Chibok girls. 

""While parents of Dapchi girls rejoice because of the reunion with their children, I want to appeal to the Chibok community never to lose hope or despair,"" he said. ""We are determined as never before to bring back our remaining Chibok daughters.""

OSLO (Reuters) - The Norwegian government proposed on Friday a nationwide ban on the wearing of full-face veils, such as the burqa and the niqab, in universities, schools, and kindergartens.
France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Bulgaria and the German state of Bavaria have all imposed restrictions on wearing full-face veils in public places.
If passes by parliament, Norway could become the first Nordic country to introduce such ban in the education sector, Finance Minister Siv Jensen said in a statement. Denmark plans to fine people who cover their face in public.
Jensen, who is also the leader of the anti-immigrant right-wing Progress Party, said the ban would send a strong signal that Norway is ""an open society where we are going to see the face of each other"".
The government amended an initial proposal, first presented in June, to allow the wearing of full-face veils during breaks and staff meetings in schools and universities, but it would have to apply throughout working hours at kindergartens.
""A ban on face-covering garments will ensure open communication with children, students and newly arrived immigrants in educational situations,"" Jan Tore Sanner, minister of knowledge and integration said in the statement. Sanner belongs to the center-right Conservatives. 
Full and partial face veils such as burqas and niqabs divide opinion across Europe, setting advocates of religious freedom against secularists and those who argue that such garments are culturally alien or a symbol of the oppression of women.
The niqab covers everything but the eyes, while the burqa also covers the eyes with a transparent veil.
Under the Norwegian proposal, employees who broke the rule several times would risk losing their jobs, and students would face expulsion, the government said. The ban would not apply to headgear like the hijab or hats.
Local bans on wearing burqa and niqab have been already introduced in some upper secondary schools in Norway. 
Norway's minority government, a coalition of the Conservatives, the Progress Party and the centrist Liberals, said in June it was confident it would find enough support for the move in parliament. If it does, the ban would start in August.
Separately, Oslo police said in a report that the capital had seen the highest reported number of hate crimes last year, with 198 incidents considered, against 175 in 2016.
""The biggest increase we see among are women insulted in the category of religion, and more specifically Islam,"" said the police in a statement.

Success in resolving the issue would open Macedonia's path toward NATO and EU membership, which has been blocked by Athens which says the name Macedonia implies a territorial claim over Greece's own northern region of that name.
The two states have made little progress on the issue since 1991, when Macedonia split from the former Yugoslavia. Pending a settlement, it was admitted to the United Nations in 1993 under the name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). 
Kotzias and his Macedonian counterpart met on Friday in Skopje to discuss details of the draft proposals their government made on how to resolve the dispute. 
""Today we made steps to solve the problems,"" Kotzias told reporters after meeting his Macedonian counterpart Nikola Dimitrov. 
""Texts are made to clarify the positions and suggestions of both sides. What is agreed between us, (United Nations special envoy Matthew) Mr. Nimetz will put into one text that will be submitted to the Security Council and the General Assembly of the U.N,"" he said.
""We have agreed in great degree what we want for the future,"" he said.
The new government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev which took over last May pledged to work closer with Greece to bring the 2 million-strong nation closer to EU and NATO membership.
Kotzias arrived in Skopje on Thursday. He is the first Greek foreign minister to fly in to Skopje airport after 12 years. 
Both Macedonian and Greek officials have said both countries would be ready to accept a compound name with a geographical ""qualifier"" such as Northern Macedonia or Upper Macedonia, but the two parties are yet to agree if that would require change of Macedonia's constitution and to which extent.

Merkel appointed Seehofer, who leads her conservative Bavarian allies, to her cabinet as interior minister under a coalition deal struck earlier this month. Barely a week into the job, he has already strained the fragile 'grand coalition'. 
""I will not change my politics a jot,"" Seehofer told Der Spiegel magazine, which said he was deeply annoyed by Merkel contradicting him.
A week ago, Seehofer told the Bild daily that ""Islam does not belong"" in Germany, prompting Merkel to say on Wednesday during her first government statement to parliament since starting her fourth term in office: ""Islam has become part of Germany.""
Germany is home to some four million Muslims, including many Turks who have lived there for decades as well as migrants and asylum seekers who arrived in the past few years, many fleeing conflicts in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere.
Seehofer, who leads the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), has long been a thorn in the chancellor's side - especially over immigration and the role of migrants in Germany.
But whereas he was not in the last government, he now leads the powerful interior ministry, restyled to include a 'homeland' portfolio - a ploy widely seen as being aimed at winning back voters lost to the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD).
BAVARIAN ELECTION
Seehofer is concerned that his CSU will lose ground to the AfD in a regional election in October in Bavaria, where refugees flooded across the border during Europe's 2015 migrant crisis.
The left-leaning Social Democrats, who are partners with the CDU and CSU in the ruling coalition, have accused him of using his new ministerial post to campaign for the Bavarian election.
In his first speech to parliament as interior minister, Seehofer on Friday promised a zero-tolerance approach both to borders being overrun and to hate crimes committed against people of other beliefs.
Seehofer also said that militant Islamists pose a threat to national security and said there should be border controls between neighboring EU states so long as the European Union's external borders are not controlled effectively. 

Seehofer, who during the 2015 refugee crisis repeatedly criticized Merkel's ""open-door"" policy for asylum seekers, reaffirmed his plans to curb migration and facilitate deportations of those who have no right to stay.

580,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 10:31AM ET</span>","A child dies, a child lives: why Somalia drought is not another famine","By Maggie Fick and Katharine Houreld
DOLLOW, Somalia (Reuters) - At the height of Somalia's 2011 famine, Madow Mohamed had to leave her crippled five-year-old son Abdirahman by the side of the road to lead her eight other starving children toward help.
When she returned to search for him, she found only a grave. He was among the 260,000 Somalis who perished. 
""You can never forget leaving your child to die,"" she says, wiping away tears at the memory seven years later. ""It is a hell that does not end.""
This time, the drought has been harsher. Three seasons of rains have failed, instead of two. But none of Mohamed's other children have died - and the overall death toll, although unknown, is far lower. The United Nations has documented just over 1,000 deaths, mostly from drinking dirty water.
Why?
Earlier donor intervention, less interference by a weakened Islamist insurgency, a stronger Somali government and greater access for aid workers have been crucial.
Another reason is that aid agencies are shifting from giving out food to cash - a less wasteful form of aid that donors such as Canada, Europe and Australia have embraced, although the United States still has restrictions on food aid. 
The U.S. Congress will debate a move toward cash-based aid this year when lawmakers vote on a new Farm Bill. Christopher Barrett, an expert on food aid at Cornell University, is one of many scholars, politicians and aid agencies demanding reform.
""A conservative estimate is that we sacrifice roughly 40,000 children's lives annually because of antiquated food aid policies,"" he told Congress in November. 
FROM FOOD TO CASH 
In 2011, a few donors gave out cash in Somalia, but the World Food Programme only gave out food. It was often hijacked by warlords or pirates, or rotted under tarpaulins as trucks sat at roadblocks. 
Starving families had to trek for days through the desert to reach distribution points. Their route became so littered with children's corpses it was called ""the Road of Death"". 
Now, more than 70 percent of WFP aid in Somalia is cash, much of it distributed via mobile phones. More than 50 other charities are also giving out cash: each month Mohamed receives $65 from the Italian aid group Coopi to spend as she wants: milk, medicine, food or school fees.
Cash has many advantages over food aid if markets are functioning. It's invisible, so less likely to be stolen. It's mobile so families can move or stay put. 
WFP said it gave out $134 million directly to Somali families to spend at local shops last year. 
""We ... basically gave confidence to the market to stay active,"" said Laurent Bukera, head of WFP Somalia.
And money is more efficient than bags of food: in Somalia, cash aid means 80 cents in every $1 goes directly to the family, rather than 60 cents from food aid, said Calum McLean, the cash expert at the European Union's humanitarian aid department. 
Cash might have saved little Abdirahman. 
""I could have stayed in my village if I had had cash. There was some food in the markets. It was expensive, but if you had money, there was food to buy,"" Mohamed said sadly. 
GLOBAL SHIFT
Aid groups have been experimenting with cash for two decades but McLean says the idea took off five years ago as the Syrian civil war propelled millions of refugees into countries with solid banking systems. 
Donors have adapted. Six years ago, five percent of the EU's humanitarian aid budget was cash distributions. Today, it is more than a third.
Most of the initial cost lies in setting up the database and the distribution system. After that, adding more recipients is cheap, McLean said. Amounts can be easily adjusted depending on the level of need or funding. 
""Cash distributions also becomes cheaper the larger scale you do it,"" he said. 
Most U.S. international food assistance is delivered by USAID's Food for Peace Office, which had a budget of $3.6 billion in 2017.
Just under half those funds came through U.S. Farm Bill Title II appropriations, which stipulate that most food must be bought from American farmers. The U.S. Cargo Preference Act requires that half of this be shipped on U.S.-flagged vessels.
Despite these restrictions, Food for Peace increased cash and voucher programs from 3 percent of the budget in 2011 to 20 percent last year. 
But sourcing food aid in the United States is expensive and wasteful, said Barrett, who oversaw a study that found buying grain close to an emergency was half the price and 14 weeks faster. Arguments that food aid supported U.S. farmers or mariners were largely false, he said. 
HOW IT WORKS
Aid groups use different systems to distribute cash, but most assess families, then register them in a biometric database, usually via fingerprints. Cash is distributed using bank cards or mobile phones or as vouchers. 
Some charities place no restrictions on the cash; others, like WFP, stipulate it can only be spent at certain shops with registered shopkeepers. 
In Dollow, the dusty town on the Ethiopian border where Mohamed lives with her surviving children, families say the cash has transformed their lives. 
Gacalo Aden Hashi, a young mother whose name means ""sweetheart"", remembers trudging past two dead children in 2011 on her way to get help. A third was alive but dying, she said, and her weakened family had to press on. 
When she arrived at the camp, men were stealing food aid to give to their families, she said. 
""Men were punching each other in line every time at food distributions,"" she said. ""Sometimes you would be sitting and suddenly your food would be taken by some strong young man."" 
Now, she says, no one can steal her money - Coopi uses a system that requires a PIN to withdraw money. Most of her cash goes on food but with a group of other women she saved enough to open a small stall.
""The cash may end, but this business will not,"" she said.
PROBLEMS PERSIST
Cash won't work everywhere. In South Sudan, where famine briefly hit two counties last year, the civil war shut markets, forcing aid agencies to bring in food by plane and truck. 
Sending cash to areas hit by earthquakes would drive up prices. But in a drought, where livelihoods have collapsed but infrastructure is intact, cash transfers are ideal, experts say.
Some problems remain. There's often little co-ordination among donors - for instance, there are seven separate databases in Somalia, said McLean, and monthly stipends can vary widely. 
In Uganda, authorities are investigating reports of fraud after the government used its own biometric registration system for refugees.
And if there's no clean water or health service available, then refugees can't spend money buying water or medicine. 

But most scholars agree that switching to more cash aid would save more lives, a 2016 briefing paper by the Congressional Research Service concluded.

Prime Minister Soumeylou Boubeye Maiga and eight of his ministers are making a nine-stop national tour aimed at shoring up support for the government of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita ahead of national elections planned for July 29.
""The head of government (Maiga) will meet the political and administrative authorities of the area and will also pay a visit to traditional chiefs,"" the statement announcing his arrival by helicopter said.
Worsening security has raised doubts about whether the vote can go ahead, especially in Kidal, where much of the population wants to secede and create an independent Tuareg state.
Mali has been in turmoil since Tuareg-led rebels and Islamist militants in 2012 seized control of the country's desert north. 
French forces intervened the following year to push them back, but lawlessness has persisted, with frequent attacks on the interests of national governments and Western powers spreading across the region.
Government overtures like this will be vital for building trust and helping secure Mali's north, but previous attempts to pacify Kidal have not gone well.
In 2014, former prime minister Moussa Mara's delegation was greeted with gun and rocket fire. A battle between the Malian army and Tuaregs at the time killed at least 50 soldiers and forced Kidal state governor Sidi Mohamed Ag Ichrach to flee.
After that, Mali's central government based in the south more or less gave up on trying to re-establish sovereignty over Kidal, but a ceasefire deal between pro and anti-government Tuareg factions last year, and subsequent talks, made this latest visit possible with the consent of the main factions.
Ichrach was able to return to Kidal last year following that deal. But the Islamists remain opposed to any talks, and on Thursday, a U.N. peacekeepers' camp near Kidal in Mali came under mortar fire from suspected Islamists. Since then, there have been no further reports of violence.

ABOARD USS WASP, Philippine Sea (Reuters) - The U.S. military on Friday launched vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) F-35Bs from the deck of the USS Wasp amphibious carrier in the waters around Okinawa in its first show of stealth aircraft force at sea.
The exercise comes at a time when concerns remain high over North Korea's nuclear program, although regional tension has eased in recent weeks, coinciding with the North's participation in the Winter Olympics held in South Korea last month. 
""This is a historic deployment. For the first time we take a marine stealth fighter F-35B. We pair it with a navy amphibious ship,"" Rear Admiral Brad Cooper, commander of the U.S. Navy's Expeditionary Strike Group 7, told reporters.
""And together this represents what I believe is the most significant lead in war fighting capability of our life time ... It gives us more ability to underscore peace, security and stability in this region.""
During the training, an F-35B fighter took off after running just 100 meters (109 yards) or so on the deck, and when it came back with its jet engine roaring, the aircraft hovered over the ship once, and then began its slow, vertical descent. 
It is capable of a vertical, as well as short takeoff.
In November, the United States deployed 16 F-35Bs to its Marine Corps base in Iwakuni, western Japan. The refurbished Wasp moved to its base in Sasebo on Japan's major southwestern island of Kyushu in January to replace the amphibious carrier that was deployed there. 
SIGNIFICANT UPGRADE
While the U.S. Air Force version of the F-35 is already flying from bases in Japan, the addition of the F-35B to replace aging Harrier jump jets marks a significant upgrade to U.S. marine force capability around the East China Sea, where China is also bolstering its military.
China already has one operational aircraft carrier, the second-hand Soviet-era Liaoning bought from Ukraine in 1998, and is carrying out tests on its first indigenously built carrier, launched last year and expected to enter service in 2020.
Beijing is also modernizing its military with stealth aircraft and other new equipment, and plans to spend 1.11 trillion yuan ($176 billion) on its armed forces in 2018, more than three times as much as Japan and around a third of what the United States spends.
Japan may also buy the F-35B, which it could fly from its two Izumo-class helicopters carriers with small improvements to the ships such as strengthening their decks against the 450 degree Celsius (842°F) heat blast from the F-35B's engine.
""Changes to the Izumo could be completed within three months,"" said a retired senior commander of Japan's Maritime Self Defense Force (MSDF). He asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the topic.
Japan, which has already ordered 42 F-35As, could also operate F-35Bs from islands along the Okinawa chain that skirts the edge of the East China Sea that don't have runways. 
""Using its stealth capabilities the F-35 could fly deep into North Korea or China to target mobile air defense batteries or ballistic missile launchers,"" said Bonji Ohara, senior fellow at Sasakawa Peace Foundation, a think-tank. Ohara also is a former MSDF captain.

LONDON (Reuters) - A millionaire Brexiteer who cultivates the image of an English gentleman from another century, Jacob Rees-Mogg is one of the unlikely winners of the 2016 referendum and is the bookmakers' favorite to become next leader of the Conservative Party.
His foes dismiss Rees-Mogg, always immaculately turned out in a double-breasted suit, as a hidebound reactionary, but he leads a powerful group of lawmakers that Prime Minister Theresa May must mollify as she tries to forge a Brexit divorce in Brussels.
May has so far shown some skill at keeping her dual negotiation with the EU and her lawmakers on track, though the 30-year schism inside her party over Europe helped sink the premierships of Margaret Thatcher, John Major and David Cameron.
By dangling the prize of eventual Brexit, May has managed to sell a transition deal to her Brexiteer lawmakers that preserves almost all aspects of Britain's EU membership for 21 months after its formal exit on March 29, 2019.
""The reality is we will leave on the 31st of December 2020 at the end of the transition period,"" Rees-Mogg told Reuters. ""I am not keen on the transition phase but I can cope with it as long as it leads to a full departure from the European Union.""
""Do I think we should have been tougher? Yes I do. I think we should have been tougher in the transition period but it is the end-state that really matters.""
For Rees-Mogg, full Brexit means leaving the customs union, the single market and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice while taking control of Britain's borders and ensuring that any laws are approved by the Westminster parliament.
""That is what I expect to see delivered,"" Rees-Mogg said. ""I can't imagine that the prime minister would bring forward any proposals that I would be uncomfortable with.""
His Brexit views were once far-fetched in Britain. Just two decades ago, then-Labour prime minister Tony Blair, a centrist, aspired to put the country at the ""heart of Europe"" and considered taking it into the euro.
Fast forward to 2018, and euroskeptics of the right such as Rees-Mogg and of the left such as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - who backed staying in the EU but with scant enthusiasm - have seen their popularity rise in the world's sixth largest economy. 
Both are now considered possible future prime ministers.
PM REES-MOGG?
Rees-Mogg, 48, appears to revel in his image as a patrician with the common touch.
The beneficiary of a privileged English education, he owns both a 1936 Bentley and a 1968 Bentley, he still talks of his nanny and has a private fortune. Fellow lawmakers call him ""the honorable member for the 18th Century"".
Is the posh persona for real?
""Oh. Um. I am as I am and I have been as I am for all of my life,"" he said. ""Do you think anybody in their right mind would invent my persona on a blank sheet of paper? It therefore must be real.""
""Who would invent this particular image? It is just who I am,"" he said in his Westminster office where a picture of Robert Peel, a 19th century Conservative premier who split his party when he repealed the protectionist corn laws, hangs on the wall.
Yet he is popular in his party and among some younger voters. In a poll of Conservative members, he was the favorite to be the next leader, ahead of Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, also both Brexiteers.
Betting markets give him a 20 percent chance of being the next leader while Johnson, once the favorite and now his closest rival, has just a 9 percent chance.
'Moggmania', as it has been dubbed, has astonished him as well as the entire British political establishment which is still reeling from Corbyn's popularity, or 'Corbynmania'.
""Rees-Mogg’s appeal is similar to that of Corbyn,"" said Anand Menon, professor of European politics at King's College in London.
""Despite his old-fashioned exterior and views, he is not seen as part of the political mainstream and that counts as authenticity in the new era of populism,"" said Menon.
""THERE IS NO VACANCY""
Rees-Mogg says voters want leaders who are genuine, even if their views are out of synch with the prevailing consensus. His own opposition to abortion and same sex marriage, rooted in his Roman Catholic faith, distances him from the modern liberal consensus in Britain.
""The electorate wants politicians who say what they think rather than spin that was so successfully employed by politicians like Tony Blair and Bill Clinton in the United States,"" he said. ""The age of spin has passed.""
""I've made it very clear that I do not seek to impose a theocracy in the United Kingdom,"" he said. ""I am not an Ayatollah of Somerset, and that the views I have as a practising Catholic are fairly conventional Christian views.""
The son of a former editor of The Times newspaper, Rees-Mogg was raised by his nanny - who now looks after his own six children - and he then studied at Eton, an exclusive private school, and Oxford University, where he studied history.
He joined J. Rothschild investment management in 1991, focusing on emerging markets, and later worked in Hong Kong.
On the eve of the financial crisis, he jokes, he set up Somerset Capital Management with two others in 2007. It now has $9.6 billon under management.
""Oh I loved it. It was the most interesting work outside politics,"" he said.
He refused to give a figure on his personal wealth or comment on reports that he is worth over 100 million pounds.
After campaigning for election to parliament in various seats, he eventually was elected in 2010 for North East Somerset, where, he said, his Mogg ancestors moved in 1618.
When asked if he gave up high finance to become prime minister, he chuckles: ""I am a backbench MP."" 
""I am fully supporting Mrs May. There is no vacancy, nor do I want there to be a vacancy. I want her to carry on. I think she is providing the leadership the nation needs.""

But if May ceased to be leader? ""To represent one's own community in the oldest and greatest parliament in the world: if that doesn't satisfy somebody's ambition then I hate to think what would.""

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian lawmaker Nadiya Savchenko began a hunger strike on Friday to protest her detention on charges of planning a coup against the government, less than two years after being welcomed home as a national hero. 
Savchenko, an ex-helicopter navigator who served time in a Russian jail as a prisoner of war, was detained in Kiev on Thursday. Authorities charged her with planning an attack on parliament using grenades and automatic weapons.
Since her return to Ukraine, Savchenko has been a frequent and outspoken critic of the administration in Kiev. She says the authorities set up the coup plot to discredit her, but she does not deny seeking to overthrow the government.
Speaking at a televised pre-trial hearing to determine the terms of her arrest, Savchenko said she would protest her treatment the same way she did her imprisonment in Russia.
""I will go on a hunger strike from today and again show all the unbelievers,"" she said. ""I will show the Ukrainian people what a hero is.""
She wore a black t-shirt with a trident motif - a national symbol in Ukraine - similar to her outfit while standing trial in Russia. 
Her defiance in the Russian court earned her the nickname of Ukraine's ""Joan of Arc,"" and at the time posters calling for her release were hung on the streets, at airports and in the chamber of parliament. 
But she has fallen out of favor since returning to Kiev in 2016 because of her outspoken manner and erratic behavior.
In 2016, President Petro Poroshenko conferred on Savchenko the country's highest honor, ""Hero of Ukraine."" But on Thursday he suggested her alleged coup plot was a Russia-led special operation to destabilize Ukraine.
""All this is another reminder that a large-scale hybrid war is being waged against Ukraine,"" he said in a post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Later on Friday, the court is expected to decide whether to release Savchenko pending trial or keep her in detention.

OSLO (Reuters) - Human activities are causing an alarming decline in the variety of plant and animal life on Earth and jeopardizing food, clean water and energy supplies, a U.N.-backed study of biodiversity said on Friday.
Pollution, climate change and forest clearances to make way for farmland were among the worsening threats to nature, according to more than 550 experts in a set of reports approved by 129 governments after talks in Colombia.
""Biodiversity, the essential variety of life-forms on earth, continues to decline in every region of the world,"" the authors wrote. ""This alarming trend endangers the quality of life of people everywhere.""
Four regional reports covered the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, Africa, Europe and Central Asia - all areas of the planet except the poles and the high seas.
For the Americas, the report estimated that the value of nature to people - such as crops, wood, water purification or tourism - was at least $24.3 trillion a year, equivalent to the region's gross domestic product from Alaska to Argentina.
Almost two-thirds of those natural contributions were in decline in the Americas, it said.
""Biodiversity and nature's contributions to people sound, to many people, academic and far removed from our daily lives,"" said Robert Watson, chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).
""Nothing could be further from the truth.""
ELEPHANTS AND MOSSES
Among other economic estimates, the Africa report said the absorption of greenhouse gases by a hectare (2.5 acres) of forest in Central Africa was worth $14,000 a year.
Around the world, ever more animals and plants were under threat, ranging from elephants in Africa to rare mosses in Europe. More than half of African bird and mammal species could be lost to climate change by 2100, it said.
""By 2100, climate change could ... result in the loss of more than half of African bird and mammal species,"" said Emma Archer of South Africa, the co-chair of the African assessment.
For pollution, eight of 10 rivers around the world with most plastic waste were in Asia. On current trends, overfishing meant there could be no exploitable fish stocks in the Asia-Pacific region by mid-century.
Rising human populations in many developing nations would require new policies both to protect nature and to meet U.N. goals to eradicate poverty and hunger by 2030.
In Europe and Central Asia, wetlands have declined by half since 1970. The average ecological footprint - or land needed per person for a sustainable environment - was 5.1 hectares against an available 2.2.
Amid the gloom, there were some bright spots.
Forest cover had risen by 22.9 percent in China and other nations in northeast Asia between 1990 and 2015. Parks and other protected areas were expanding in many regions, including the Americas and Asia-Pacific.

And populations of animals such as the Iberian lynx, Amur tiger and far eastern leopard were coming back from the brink of extinction thanks to conservation.

587,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 08:31AM ET</span>","Sarkozy vows to vanquish 'Gaddafi gang', fights barring order","PARIS (Reuters) - Nicolas Sarkozy will challenge a barring order that forbids him from meeting key accusers and allies or traveling to countries such as Libya pending a judicial investigation into allegations that Muammar Gaddafi bankrolled his 2007 election campaign.
Sarkozy's lawyer, speaking publicly for the first time since the former French leader was taken into policy custody this week and told he was officially suspected of passive corruption, said he would lodge a legal appeal against the barring order.
Sarkozy himself, who held office from 2007 to 2012, launched a counter-offensive on prime-time television overnight, vowing to ""vanquish"" his accusers, among them, in his words, ""The Gaddafi gang, a gang of assassins"".
The 63-year-old, target of other judicial inquiries into political financing but nothing that resonates like the Libyan one, said magistrates did not have a shred of hard evidence and that the accusations against him were a ""monstrosity"".
In an appearance on one of France's main evening news shows that was watched by 6.9 million people, or more than one in six of the electorate, Sarkozy said:
""You cannot imagine how seriously I take this: if it takes me one year, two year or ten years, I will vanquish this gang. My honor will triumph. I will not cede a single centimeter to this lot.""
His lawyer, Thierry Herzog, used the same colorful language when he went on radio on Friday to defend his client.
""I will prove (ex-) President Sarkozy innocent. I will give proof he is innocent and then we will know who the evildoers are, who the thugs are, who the assassins are, who the robbers are,"" he told RTL.
Herzog, who is also handling a separate case where Sarkozy stands accused of illicit spending overruns in his failed 2012 re-election bid, said he was going to appeal a judicial barring order imposed on Sarkozy when he was released from custody on Wednesday after two days of questioning.
That order prohibits him from traveling to Libya, Tunisia and South Africa, sources close to Sarkozy say.
It bars him from meeting accusers that include members of the late Libyan leader Gaddafi's family and Libyan secret services as well as a Franco-Lebanese arms dealer who says he delivered cash in a suitcase to Paris as well as an intermediary arrested in London earlier this year.
He is also barred from meeting key allies including Claude Gueant and Brice Hortefeux, two close aides who were ministers under Sarkozy and have also been questioned by the judiciary.
Sarkozy said on the TF1 TV channel on Thursday that the sum police came up with for suspect money circulated during the 2007 campaign was 38,000 euros, calling that ""a very far cry"" from the 50 million euros cited by his accusers.

He also said that, while criticized for hosting Gaddafi with red carpet treatment in late 2007 in Paris, he was one of the chief advocates of the NATO-led intervention in 2011 in Libya, where Gaddafi was killed in rebel hands.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's parliament met for the first time on Friday after a national election earlier this month left no group with any clear majority and as talks between political rivals stalled.
The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which emerged the biggest party in the March 4 vote, appeared to have stitched up the choices of the speakers of the two houses, the opening act of the new parliament, just 24 hours ago.
But the 81-year-old, four-time Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, a major power-broker on the center-right, quashed the deal by insisting on meeting 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio, and by putting forward Paolo Romani, who has been convicted for embezzlement, for Senate speaker.
""Everything seemed like it was moving in the right direction, then at a certain point there was this story about Berlusconi insisting on meeting me,"" Di Maio told 5-Star lawmakers on Friday.
Five-Star's buzzword for years has been ""honesty"", partly as a way of distinguishing itself from Berlusconi, who has been convicted of tax fraud and cannot hold public office.
""We will not rehabilitate Silvio Berlusconi,"" Danilo Toninelli, the 5-Star's group leader in the lower house, said.
The election of the speakers of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies precedes formal consultations to cobble together a government and can serve as a sign as to what kind of ruling alliance could be formed.
Parliament is split into three main blocs. The center-left Democratic Party (PD) trails 5-Star, and the center-right bloc, which has the most seats. 
The vote relegated Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) to junior partner behind the far-right League for the first time. 
League party leader Matteo Salvini ""had been selected to speak for the center right, and that's who we talked to,"" Di Maio said. 
One thing to watch for during the parliamentary voting in coming days will be whether Salvini continues to allow Berlusconi to call the shots, or whether he will break with the center-right coalition and strike a deal with 5-Star on his own.
But this looks unlikely now. Political sources have said serious negotiations to form a government might have to wait until after regional elections slated for the end of April.
Even the speaker voting could go on for days. Both 5-Star and the PD have said they would vote blank ballots on Friday, which means neither speaker is likely to be chosen before Saturday, when a smaller majority is needed to elect them.

The Foreign Office issued a statement in the wake of the sentencing of Palestinian teenage girl Ahed Tamimi, who was arrested after kicking and slapping an Israeli soldier in the occupied West Bank in December.
Tamimi, who was 16 at the time of the incident, accepted a plea deal this week under which she will be sentenced to eight months in prison, her lawyer said.
Alistair Burt, Britain's Minister for the Middle East, said in the statement: ""The conviction and sentencing of Ahed Tamimi is emblematic of how the unresolved (Israeli-Palestinian) conflict is blighting the lives of a new generation who should be growing up together in peace, but continue to be divided.""
""The treatment of Palestinian children in Israeli military detention remains a human rights priority for the UK. We will continue to call upon Israel to improve its practices in line with international law and obligations,"" he said.
Burt said Britain had offered to help the Israeli authorities through expert-to-expert talks with British officials. Israel had made some improvements but needed to do much more to safeguard vulnerable people in its care, he said.
Tamimi became a hero to Palestinians after the incident outside her home in the village of Nabi Saleh was streamed live on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) by her mother and went viral.
The soldiers had deployed during a weekly Palestinian protest in the village against Israeli policy on settlements in the West Bank, one of the most heated issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Palestinians want the West Bank for a future state, along with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. Most countries consider as illegal the Israeli settlements, built on territory which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
Israel disputes that its settlements are illegal and says their future should be determined in talks with the Palestinians, although the peace process has collapsed.
Amnesty International said after Tamimi's conviction that her sentence was at odds with international law and showed that Israel had no regard for the rights of Palestinian children.
About 350 Palestinian children were currently in Israeli detention, the human rights group said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia has unveiled the names for a new generation of nuclear-powered missiles touted by President Vladimir Putin as invincible after more than seven million people took part in a quirky public vote organized by the Russian military.
The names chosen include 'Peresvet,' after a medieval warrior monk, for a laser and 'Burevestnik,' after a seabird, for a cruise missile.
The arms systems, which Putin revealed in a bellicose state-of-the-nation speech this month, include a nuclear-powered cruise missile, an underwater nuclear-powered drone, and a laser weapon.
Putin has often used militaristic rhetoric to mobilize support and buttress his narrative that Russia is under siege from the West, and some critics complain that public discourse increasingly resembles that of a country at war. 
The culmination of the ""name that weapon"" vote comes amid fears in both Russia and the West about a new arms race, something Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump have said they don't want, and after Putin won a landslide re-election victory.
Russia's Ministry of Defence asked the public to name the weapons systems in an online vote, something it has never done before, and unveiled the results late on Thursday on state TV.
After the results were announced, Deputy Defence Minister Yuri Borisov explained on state TV, to ripples of applause, what the new weapons were capable of. 
WARRIOR MONK, GREEK GOD AND SEABIRD
The defense ministry said Russians had voted to name the new military laser 'Peresvet' after a medieval warrior monk, Alexander Peresvet, who took part in a 14th century battle against the Mongols. Peresvet is revered by some clerics in the Russian Orthodox Church, whose influence has grown under Putin.
The winning name for the underwater nuclear drone was more conventional - 'Poseidon' after the Greek god of the sea, drawing criticism from some Russians who complained the name was too foreign. 
The new nuclear-powered cruise missile, which Putin has boasted could hit almost any point in the world and evade a U.S.-built missile shield, will be called 'Burevestnik,' Russian for the Storm Petrel bird, the defense ministry said.
The Storm Petrel is a seabird whose presence mariners believe foretells bad weather.
Putin's boasts about the new weapons have been greeted with scepticism in Washington, where officials have cast doubt on whether Russia has added any new capabilities to its nuclear arsenal beyond those already known to the U.S. military and intelligence agencies.
Among the suggested names for the weapons systems that did not make the final cut: 'Stalin,' after the Soviet dictator, and 'Palmyra,' after the Syrian city which Russian forces helped Syrian President Bashar al-Assad take back from Islamic State.

Ankara accuses Gulen, who lives in the United States, of masterminding a failed coup in July 2016, a claim he denies. Since the coup attempt, the authorities have arrested thousands of his suspected followers and fired thousands more.
Friday's roundup included warrants for 55 employees in 13 provinces of Isik Publications, a publishing company that printed Gulen's books, Istanbul police said. 
Warrants were also issued for 38 former police officers in six provinces who were accused of being members of Gulen's purported network, the state-run news agency Anadolu reported. Twenty-four had been detained, it said.
In addition, police targeted 62 executives of five labor unions in a third operation spread across seven provinces, Anadolu said. Thirty-eight had been detained, it said.
The labor unions were part of Aksiyon Is Confederation, an association of unions that was shut down over suspected links to the Gulen network.
In the 18 months through December 2017, nearly 160,000 people have been arrested and 152,000 civil servants sacked as part of a post-coup crackdown, according to a report published by the United Nations on Tuesday.
The UN urged Turkey to end its state of emergency, which was declared after the coup and has been extended six times. It accused Ankara of mass arrests, arbitrary sackings, collective punishment and torturing detainees.
Turkey's foreign ministry said the report was filled with unfounded allegations and compared the criticism to propaganda from militant groups.
The crackdown has also been criticized by Turkey's Western allies, who accuse President Tayyip Erdogan of using the failed putsch as a pretext to quash dissent. Turkey says the measures are necessary to combat threats to national security.

TREBES, France (Reuters) - A gunman killed three people in southwestern France on Friday as he held up a car, fired on police and seized hostages in a supermarket, screaming ""Allahu Akbar"" before security forces stormed the building and killed him, authorities said.
Sixteen other people were wounded, including two who were seriously hurt, in what President Emmanuel Macron called an act of ""Islamist terrorism"".
The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack. Macron said security services were checking that claim.
""I want to tell the nation tonight of my absolute determination in leading this fight,"" said Macron, who returned to Paris from Brussels to chair a crisis meeting with ministers and security officials.
More than 240 people have been killed in France in attacks since 2015 by assailants who pledged allegiance to Islamic State or were inspired by the group.
Friday's attacker was identified by authorities as Redouane Lakdim, 25, from the city of Carcassonne. 
Two people were killed when he attacked the supermarket in the nearby small town of Trebes. 
Witnesses said about 20 people in the supermarket found refuge in its cold storage room.
A lieutenant-colonel of the gendarmes who swapped himself in exchange for one of the hostages was fighting for his life in hospital, Macron said. 
Moroccan-born Lakdim was known to authorities for petty crimes, but had been under surveillance by security services in 2016-2017 for links to the radical Salafist movement, said Paris prosecutor Francois Molins, who is leading the investigation.
""The monitoring ... did not reveal any apparent signs that could lead (us) to foresee he would act,"" Molins said.
He said one woman connected to Lakdim had been arrested. 
Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told reporters at the scene that he believed Lakdim had acted alone.
""Every day we detect facts and foil new attacks. Alas, this one struck without us being able to counter it,"" Collomb said.
Lakdim first killed one person with a bullet in the head while stealing a car in Carcassonne, a walled city with a medieval citadel that is one of France's top tourist attractions.
He pulled up in the car to four police officers who were jogging in the city and opened fire, hitting one in the shoulder, then sped off to Trebes, about 8 km (5 miles) to the east, where he took the hostages in the supermarket.
""The perpetrator entered the store shouting 'Allahu Akbar' and indicated that he was an Islamic State soldier who was ready to die for Syria, seeking the release of brothers, before shooting at a client and a store employee who died on the spot,"" Molins said.
Police were carrying out searches at Lakdim's family home.
ESCAPE
One supermarket worker said some shoppers had escaped from the building after the gunman burst in.
""I was in my department when I heard gunshots. I went to the area of the gunshots and came face to face with the person,"" said the employee, who gave his name only as Francois.
""He raised his gun and fired, I ran away, he shouted 'Allahu Akbar' and spoke about the Islamic State. I then evacuated the clients, about 20, who were in my area and we went quietly out of the back,"" said Francois, who has been employed at the supermarket since November.
Collomb said the gunman had demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam - the prime surviving suspect in Islamic State suicide bombing and mass shooting attacks on a sports stadium, concert hall and restaurants that killed 130 people in Paris in 2015.
Abdeslam, a French citizen born and raised in Brussels, went on trial in Belgium last month. He is accused of ""attempted murder in a terrorist context"" over a Brussels shootout in March 2016, four months after he fled Paris on the night of the carnage during which his brother was among the suicide bombers.
""THE THREAT IS EVERYWHERE""
France is part of a U.S.-led coalition fighting against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq and also has thousands of soldiers in West Africa fighting al Qaeda-linked militants. 
In February, Collomb said French security forces had foiled two planned attacks so far this year as Islamic State militants set their sights on domestic targets in response to the group's military setbacks in Iraq and Syria.
""This is a small, quiet town. Unfortunately the threat is everywhere,"" Collomb told reporters in Trebes.
Carcassonne, a UNESCO heritage site, lies in the Languedoc region, known for its wine and picturesque countryside but also one of the poorest areas in France, with unemployment about 3 percentage points above the national average. 
Nearby Beziers is one of the biggest cities controlled by the far-right, while the smaller town of Lunel further east became a breeding ground for many French jihadists who travelled to Syria to fight.
Almost six years ago to the day, Islamist gunman Mohammed Merah killed seven people in the Toulouse region, about 90 km from Carcassonne. He was killed by security forces after a more than 30-hour stand-off.
The last lethal Islamist attack in France was in October 2017 when a Tunisian-born man stabbed two young women to death in Marseille before he was shot dead by soldiers. Islamic State also claimed responsibility for that attack.

China has been increasing its efforts to win over young Taiwanese, a key demographic to reach out to amid souring political relations between Beijing and Taipei, including offering incentives to set up businesses in China.
China claims Taiwan as its sovereign territory and considers people from the self-ruled island to be Chinese citizens.
In a statement issued after a meeting to discuss China's recently concluded parliamentary session, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said the government should up efforts to counter China trying to attract talent, such as students and teachers.
""Some council members said that young people in Taiwan set great store on democracy and freedom, which is exactly what the environment in mainland Chinese society cannot provide,"" it said.
""The government can strengthen and show off Taiwan's advantages, and help young people understand the possible risks.""
Taiwan's current government swept into power with the help of the youth-driven Sunflower Movement, protesting against a trade pact with China, something Taiwan's government has said caught China's attention, which is why China is now focusing on young Taiwanese.
Taiwan is one of China's most sensitive issues, and China's hostility toward the island has risen since Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party won the presidency in 2016.
China fears she wants to push for formal independence, though Tsai says she wants to maintain the status quo and peace.
Chinese President Xi Jinping warned Taiwan on Tuesday it would face the ""punishment of history"" for any attempt at separatism, offering his strongest warning yet to the island.
China has also been infuriated by a new U.S. law which encourages contacts and exchanges between U.S. and Taiwanese officials even though they do not have formal ties.
The United States' commitment to Taiwan has never been stronger and the island is an inspiration to the rest of the Indo-Pacific region, a senior U.S. diplomat said in Taipei this week.
The Mainland Affairs Council said it had noted that Chinese officials have been using the term ""severe"" of late to refer to relations across the Taiwan Strait.

""The future development of relations across the Taiwan Strait is still full of challenges, and it is not easy to be optimistic,"" it added.

599,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 08:23AM ET</span>",Spain to try Catalan separatist leaders for rebellion,"By Angus Berwick
MADRID (Reuters) - Twenty-five Catalan leaders will be tried for rebellion, embezzlement or disobeying the state, Spain's Supreme Court ruled on Friday, in a sharp escalation of legal action against separatists in the northeastern region.
One of the leaders facing up to 25 years in prison if convicted, Marta Rovira, earlier said she had already fled Spain, joining six others in exile.
The ruling raised the stakes in Madrid's efforts to contain separatists in Catalonia, where a banned referendum backed independence last year.
The case will be closely watched by separatist groups across Europe and beyond. Rights groups have already criticized the extent of Madrid's crackdown - though the European Union, wary of any splintering of its member states, has firmly supported the Spanish government's response.
Catalonia has been in political limbo since Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy took over its regional government after it unilaterally declared independence following the October plebiscite.
Supreme court judge Pablo Llarena said on Friday thirteen leaders, including Rovira and former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont who is already in exile in Brussels, will be tried for rebellion. 
Another twelve will be tried for embezzlement or disobeying the state through their role in holding the referendum or declaring independence.
Puigdemont and fellow separatists have all denied any wrongdoing, saying the plebiscite gave them the authority to break away from Spain. 
""A DIFFICULT ROAD""
The vote was boycotted Catalans opposed to the region splitting from Spain. Public support for the independence of Catalonia, which has its own language, extensive devolved powers and an economy as large as Portugal's, fluctuates either side of 40 percent in polls.
Judge Llarena will rule later on Friday on whether there is enough evidence that they committed a crime to order their arrest. He did not set a date for the trial.
Rovira, the head of the separatist Esquerra Republicana party, said before the judge's announcement on Friday she had fled to avoid prosecution. 
""Exile will be a difficult road, but it is the only way I have to recover my political voice,"" Rovira said in a letter. ""Long live a Catalan Republic for all!""
The court, in a written ruling, requested that 14 members of the previous Catalan regional administration deposit 2.1 million euros ($2.59 million) in a bank account to pay back the money used to hold the referendum and cover judicial costs.
The court's decision will likely put an end to a planned vote this Saturday at the Catalan regional parliament to pick a new leader since Puigdemont's departure last year.
Jordi Turull, one of the 13 charged with rebellion and a close Puigdemont ally, narrowly failed in an earlier leadership on Thursday to win a majority of votes in the Catalan parliament.

Several separatist leaders, including former Catalan vice-president Oriol Junqueras, have been in custody since last year.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union member states agreed at a summit on Friday to take additional punitive measures against Russia for a nerve agent attack in Britain, as Moscow accused the bloc of joining a London-driven hate campaign against it.
Moscow has denied that it is behind the attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, the first known offensive use of a nerve toxin in Europe since World War Two.
But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said evidence of Russian culpability presented by British Prime Minister Theresa May was ""very solidly based"" and promised new measures after EU leaders agreed late on Thursday to recall their ambassador to Moscow.
""Germany and France agree that additional steps, on top of the recall of the ambassador, are necessary,"" Merkel said at a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron.
Macron called the attack ""unprecedented"" and said Europe must respond: ""It is an aggression against the security and sovereignty of an ally that is today a member of the European Union. It demands a reaction. This is clear.""
In a boost for May, the 28-member EU collectively condemned the attack and declared in a Brussels summit statement that it was ""highly likely"" Moscow was responsible.
A British judge said on Thursday that both victims may have suffered brain damage from the attack. A policeman who was hospitalised after discovering the two unconscious on a park bench has now been discharged.
""Additional steps are expected as early as Monday at the national level,"" summit chair Donald Tusk told reporters.
TENSIONS
The leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic and the three Baltic states - Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania - were among those predicting further expulsions of Russian diplomats from their capitals.
However, Boyko Borissov, prime minister of Bulgaria which holds the EU's rotating presidency, wanted more evidence so that ""high probability becomes full probability"" of Russian involvement.
""I expect very rapid tensions in the coming weeks because many countries will start to recall their ambassadors too. The current times are harder than the Cold War,"" Borissov said, making clear his discomfort with further measures.
Moscow has retaliated against Britain's move to expel 23 Russians by ordering out the same number of Britons.
On Friday, the Russian foreign ministry described the EU allegation as ""baseless"" and accused the bloc of spurning cooperation with Moscow and joining ""another anti-Russian campaign deployed by London and its allies overseas"".
The expulsion of British diplomats went ahead on Friday, with a convoy of minibuses speeding out of the embassy compound to applause after British embassy staff said their goodbyes in the courtyard under a light snowfall. 
""I welcomed 48 colleagues/families plus 4 dogs. Safe at home,"" Foreign Office official Simon McDonald said on Twitter after the diplomats arrived back at a British air force base later on Friday. 
France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, on a visit to Kiev, signalled that Paris was considering expelling Russian diplomats in solidarity with Britain. ""You will see,"" he said.
The summit statement hardened previous EU language on Russia's alleged role as Macron and others helped May to overcome hesitation on the part of some states that feel friendlier to Moscow. Some of them had questioned how definitive Britain's evidence is. 

Welcoming the solidarity she secured from the summit, May told reporters on leaving: ""The threat from Russia is one that respects no borders and I think it is clear that Russia is challenging the values we share as Europeans and it is right that we stand together in defence of those values.""

601,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2018 11:27AM ET</span>","May welcomes Brexit transition, trade talks loom","By Elizabeth Piper and Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed the approval by European Union leaders on Friday of a transition period to help business adapt after Brexit, telling the bloc to ride the ""new dynamic"" in upcoming trade talks.
Endorsing their negotiating stance for trade talks due to start next month, the 27 other EU leaders at a Brussels summit confirmed a political, if not yet legal, commitment to let Britain effectively stay in the bloc - without a vote - until the end of 2020, or 21 months after formal Brexit next March.
But the text carried a warning that ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"" - a threat to May to avoid ""backsliding"" on a deal to let Northern Ireland remain regulated by Brussels if no better way is found to prevent a ""hard border"" that could risk the peace.
May said the deal so far ""gives certainty to people and businesses. It gives them the clarity to plan for their future.""
""I believe there is a new dynamic now in the negotiations,"" she told reporters. ""We will now be sitting down and determining those workable solutions for Northern Ireland but also for our future security partnership and economic partnership.""
French President Emmanuel Macron reiterated the EU's mantra that London would not be allowed to ""cherry-pick"" access to parts of the EU market: ""The single market cannot be divided up. 
""There is not a choice of which sectors you sign up to. Once you are outside the single market, you're outside of it entirely,"" Macron said as he shared a podium with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to underline the unity of the bloc's founders and major powerbrokers.
While grappling with Britain's departure from the EU, other leaders' rallied behind May in her standoff with Russia over the Salisbury attack while she added her voice to EU demands on the United States that it exempt the bloc from new steel tariffs.
May said the issue mattered for British steelworkers. There was a reminder of difficulties on trade that Britain might face after Brexit when non-EU member Norway found itself excluded from the temporary exemption Trump granted to the bloc.
IRISH CONUNDRUM
The transition win for May comes at the expense of having agreed to a ""backstop"" solution on the Irish border that, if implemented, could infuriate many of her political allies as it could effectively isolate the Northern Ireland economy from mainland Britain by keeping its regulations in line with the EU.
Both sides say they do not want to go back to border checks between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland - as was the case during decades of violence in the British province. 
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar highlighted the EU stance that the transition would only become final as part of a broader deal between the bloc and London, which means they have to settle on all outstanding issues - including the Irish border - first. He noted new talks on the border start next week.
""As Ireland ... we're not the ones who are leaving so we are not under time pressure in that regard,"" Varadkar told reporters. ""If we can have an agreement on the terms of the backstop or an alternative to the backstop before June, that's something we would very much welcome.""
The Brexit schedule assumes the bloc and London would agree on the divorce deal, the transition and a framework for future trade in time for the 27 EU leaders to endorse it at a summit in October, and have it ratified before Brexit on March 29, 2019.

The bloc's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told the summit that the new deal with Britain ""will have to respect the principles and the identity of the EU and our single market"".

In a rare joint statement on China, six independent human rights experts voiced deep concern at the condition of Jiang, sentenced to two years jail last November after being found guilty of inciting subversion of state power.
""Mr. Jiang's health has apparently deteriorated dramatically in recent months. He is reportedly weak and suffers from severe memory loss, and it is suspected that he may have been drugged,"" the experts said. ""This raises fears of torture or ill-treatment in detention, without access to adequate medical care.""
Chinese President Xi Jingping has overseen a sweeping crackdown on human rights activism in China since 2015 that has seen hundreds of rights lawyers and activists detained, dozens arrested and some handed lengthy prison sentences. 
Jiang, who provided legal defense for some of the lawyers arrested in the crackdown, had already been disbarred in 2009 and disappeared in November 2016. He was held in secret detention for more than nine months, the experts said.
Many of the nearly 250 lawyers and defenders arrested remain in detention and are ""often held incommunicado"", they added.
“We appeal to the Chinese government to provide the detainees at a minimum with access to their families, lawyers of their own choosing and adequate health care,” they said.

The U.N. experts included Philip Alston, special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, who met Jiang during an official visit to China in August 2016. Alston has voiced concern at the Human Rights Council that Jiang's subsequent disappearance and arrest may be in part a reprisal for that contact, calling it ""the equivalent of a legal sledgehammer"".

Shefqet Krasniqi, the imam of the Grand Mosque of Pristina, was arrested in 2014. He was accused of inciting terrorism by encouraging young Kosovars to go to Syria and Iraq, of inciting hatred and of tax evasion.
Around 300 Kosovars have gone to Syria and Iraq since 2012 to fight with Islamic State. About 70 have been killed but many, including women and children, are believed to be still there.
""I was convinced from the first day ... that all will end as it has ended today,"" Krasniqi told the media after the verdict.
International and local security agencies have previously warned of the risk posed by returning fighters, and in 2015 Kosovo adopted a law making it a crime to fight in foreign conflicts, punishable by up to 15 years in jail.
Kosovo’s population is nominally 90 percent Muslim but largely secular in outlook. No Islamist attacks have occurred on its soil, but in June 2017, nine Kosovars were charged with planning attacks at a soccer match in Albania against the visiting Israeli national team and its fans in November 2016.

Pell, 76, is the most senior Catholic official to face such charges, the details of which have not been made public.
His lawyers have said at previous administrative hearings he will plead not guilty to all charges. Pell is not required to enter a formal plea unless a magistrate determines there is cause for a full trial.
At the close of the third week of hearings, prosecutor Mark Gibson told the court one accuser was ""medically unfit to give evidence"", so charges stemming from his evidence would be withdrawn. No other details were given.
Another charge had been dropped at the beginning of the hearing owing to the death of another of Pell's accusers.
Families of two accusers told the court on Friday they had only heard of the alleged offences long after they had allegedly occurred, one of them at a pool in regional Victoria state and the other at a church. Those families had never previously seen or heard anything improper involving priests, the court heard.
Pell's lawyer, Robert Richter, accused the sister of one of the complainants of lying in her statement to police, which said her brother had told her Pell was the alleged offender.
""That's a story that was made up by you about naming George Pell,"" Richter said.
The man's sister replied: ""I would say that's incorrect.""
Her name cannot be disclosed because it would identify one of the accusers.
Richter pressed her on why she had not asked her brother more questions about the alleged incident between the time he brought it up and when she gave a statement to police two or three years later.
""As I said before, it was a clearly painful and embarrassing thing for (my brother) and I didn't want to probe into what was going on with him,"" she said.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - A Syrian rebel group in one besieged eastern Ghouta pocket said on Friday it would try to negotiate an end to an army assault there, while insurgents in another nearby enclave withdrew. 
Ending the opposition's hold on eastern Ghouta, near the capital Damascus, would represent Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's biggest blow against the rebels since they were driven from Aleppo in December 2016
Failaq al-Rahman spokesman Wael Alwan said the group would meet Russian negotiators on Friday. He could not say whether the negotiations would lead to the fighters withdrawing. But he told al-Hadath television: ""Today is a session to find a solution to end this human suffering, whatever the cost.""
Failaq al-Rahman on Thursday announced their intention to negotiate when Alwan said a midnight ceasefire had been agreed in principle. [nL8N1R47KB] 
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a Failaq al-Rahman delegation left the enclave late Friday morning as guns fell silent after air strikes and advances by pro-government forces had continued past the midnight ceasefire deadline.
The Syrian army's assault on eastern Ghouta, the last major rebel bastion near the capital, has been one of the most intense in Syria's seven-year-old war. The United Nations says about 1,600 people have been killed and thousands wounded since mid-February. 
The Syrian government and its Russian allies used tactics that had proved successful elsewhere in Syria since Moscow joined the war in 2015 - lay siege to an area, bombard it, launch a ground assault and finally offer safe passage out to rebels who agree to leave with their families.
After helping turn the tide of the war in Syria in Assad's favor with air power and military support, Russia has increasingly cast itself as a peace-broker within Syria and the wider Middle East. Russian representatives have played a role in negotiating local ceasefires and evacuations.
Eastern Ghouta's rebels now hold only the town of Douma, under the control of Jaish al-Islam, and another pocket that includes Ein Terma, Arbin and Zamalka, under the control of Failaq al-Rahman.
On Thursday, Ahrar al-Sham rebel fighters withdrew from what had been a third rebel-held enclave in eastern Ghouta, the town of Harasta. They were put on government buses and driven to an opposition-held area of northern Syria. [nL8N1R4261] 
A second group of fighters began to leave Harasta on Friday in buses. State media said about 1,500-2,000 fighters and their families were expected to leave and said seven buses had left so far. 
The Observatory said air strikes also hit Douma, which is controlled by Jaish al-Islam, on Friday and rebels and pro-government forces clashed on the ground. 
State television broadcast footage of what it says was about 3,400 people leaving the Douma enclave on foot on Friday morning, carrying small children and belongings. Thousands of civilians have made the same journey over the past week, making their way to reception centers in government-held territory. 
The United Nations estimates more than 50,000 people have left besieged areas of eastern Ghouta in the past almost two weeks. 
The Observatory estimates a total of about 120,000 civilians have either left the enclave or remained in the towns of Kafr Batna and Saqba, which were re-taken by the government in the past eight days.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Navy destroyer carried out a ""freedom of navigation"" operation on Friday, coming within 12 nautical miles of an artificial island built by China in the South China Sea, U.S. officials told Reuters, a move likely to anger Beijing. 
Friday's operation was the latest attempt to counter what Washington sees as Beijing’s efforts to limit freedom of navigation in the strategic waters.
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the USS Mustin traveled close to Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands and carried out maneuvering operations. China has territorial disputes with its neighbors over the area.
Neither China’s Foreign nor Defence Ministries immediately responded to a request for comment.
In the past, Beijing has reacted angrily to such moves, saying they are provocative.
The U.S. military has a longstanding position that its operations are carried out throughout the world, including in areas claimed by allies, and they are separate from political considerations.
However, the latest operation, the first since January, comes just a day after U.S. President Donald Trump lit a slow-burning fuse when he signed a presidential memorandum that will target up to $60 billion in Chinese goods with tariffs, but only after a 30-day consultation period that starts once a list is published.
The United States has criticized China’s construction of islands and build-up of military facilities in the sea, and is concerned they could be used to restrict free nautical movement.
China’s claims in the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes each year, are contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. The U.S. military put countering China and Russia at the center of a new national defense strategy recently unveiled.
China's navy will carry out combat drills in the South China Sea, the military's official newspaper said on Friday, describing the move as part of regular annual exercises.
Taiwan's defense ministry said this week it had shadowed a Chinese aircraft carrier group traversing the Taiwan Strait in a southwesterly direction - meaning into the disputed South China Sea - in what Taiwan judged to be a drill.
The United States has been pushing allies to carry out freedom of navigation operations as well.

Earlier this year, Britain said one of its warships would pass through the South China Sea to assert freedom-of-navigation rights.

In a brief report on its WeChat account, the People's Liberation Army Daily said the combat exercises would take place shortly, though it gave no details of timing, location or what ships would participate.
""This is a routine annual planned arrangement for the navy, the aim of which is to test and improve the military's training level and to fully raise the ability to win. It is not aimed at any specific country or target,"" the newspaper added, without elaborating.
China's navy and air force frequently carry out drills in the South China Sea, where the government has been building man-made islands and constructing airstrips and other facilities, unnerving the region.
China claims most of the South China Sea, a key trade route and home to areas that are believed to hold large quantities of oil and natural gas. Along with China, parts of the South China Sea are subject to competing claims from Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines.
China routinely rejects criticism of its activities in the South China Sea, saying as it is Chinese territory it can do what it wants.

KYANGWALI, Uganda (Reuters) - Nguna Abooki was getting ready for bed on the evening of Feb. 1 when men with machetes and guns ambushed his village in eastern Congo, killing two of his children and three of his brothers.
""They cut them using pangas. Others were shot,"" said Abooki, a 42-year-old fisherman whose words were separated by long pauses as he recalled the violence. ""I don't know why they targeted us.""
Abooki, an ethnic Hema, identified the attackers as members of the Lendu ethnic group, farmers who have clashed with Hema herders over cattle grazing rights, crops and gold mining in the Ituri region.
After 15 years of relative peace, there has been a surge in violence between Lendu and Hema this year, driven in part by a breakdown of government authority. President Joseph Kabila's refusal leave power at the end of his mandate in 2016 has undermined the legitimacy of the state in the eyes of many Congolese.
Ituri was one of the places where Congo's civil war began in 1998, sucking in troops from Uganda and Rwanda, fuelling a 5-year conflict in which about 5 million people were killed, mostly from hunger and disease.
With a resurgence of ethnic strife in the region, and a large refugee exodus of Hema to Uganda, there are fears of history repeating itself, experts say.
The International Criminal Court has convicted warlords from both sides of the Ituri fighting, but that has not prevented further violence.
Clashes between Lendu and Hema since February have left at least 70 people dead and forced more than 60,000 to flee, bringing the total number of Congolese refugees in Uganda to over a quarter of a million. 
After grueling journeys, the refugees are starting to share their stories. Seven refugees interviewed by Reuters have given some of the first accounts of mass killings they said had been carried out by Lendu fighters.
Abooki's journey to Uganda began immediately after seeing his family members slaughtered. In the confusion of the attack, he and his wife escaped but were separated in the darkness. Fearing for his life, he caught a boat across Lake Albert into Uganda and arrived the following morning.
The route across the 40-km (25-mile) wide lake has become a well-worn but treacherous path: four refugees died when their overloaded canoe capsized in February. Lendu fighters have attacked Hema as they fled for the lake, refugees said.
The United Nations refugee agency UNHCR expects 200,000 refugees to reach Uganda from Ituri this year. 
NO PROTECTION
On arrival in Uganda, refugees are processed in a former fish-weighing station on the banks of the lake. They are then bussed 30 km (20 miles) through dense forest and a wildlife reserve to the Kyangwali refugee camp, 240 km (150 miles) northwest of the Ugandan capital, Kampala.
Their feet are sprayed with disinfectant before they are allowed to enter the camp, whose ground has been churned to mud by heavy rains. Clean water and food are hard to come by. In the last two months, 32 refugees have died from acute diarrhea, the UNHCR said. 
For the refugees interviewed by Reuters at the camp, it is still better than home.
Lendu groups typically attack Hema villages shortly after dusk. They come with guns, machetes, axes and bows and arrows, refugees said. Homes are torched.
For days, Jombu Musingo, 58, from Kakwa village, slept in the bush to evade attackers after they killed his parents and a dozen family members.
""People have been killed. Houses have been burnt. People who have been killed, their bones are lying about outside. Dogs are eating them,"" Musingo said.
Meanwhile state authority in Congo has collapsed, leaving thousands without protection. The refugees interviewed by Reuters all said that the Congolese military were unable or unwilling to help.
A Congolese government spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
Soldiers tell the Hema that they do not have ammunition to defend them against Lendu attacks, and instead encourage Hema communities to flee, refugees said. Troops also run at the sight of Lendu marauders, they said.

""When you run to them for protection, they also run and leave you,"" said Elisha Baby, 22, a fisherman from Bajere in Ituri, referring to the Congolese military. ""They say here there's going to be a big war.""

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's media regulator is cracking down on video spoofs, the official Xinhua new agency reported, amid an intensified crackdown on any content that is deemed to be in violation of socialist core values under President Xi Jinping.
The decision comes after Xi cemented his power at a recent meeting of parliament by having presidential term limits scrapped, and the ruling Communist Party tightened its grip on the media by handing control over film, news and publishing to its powerful publicity department.
Xinhua said video sites must ban videos that ""distort, mock or defame classical literary and art works"", citing a directive from the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television on Thursday. 
Reuters separately reviewed a copy of the directive, which was unusually labeled ""extra urgent"".
Industry insiders say the sweeping crackdown on media content, which has been gaining force since last year, is having a chilling effect on content makers and distributors.
""It means a lot of content makers will have to transition and make their content more serious. For 'extra urgent' notice like this, you have to act immediately,"" said Wu Jian, a Beijing-based analyst.
""Those who don't comply in time will immediately be closed down,"" Wu said.
A TV reporter's theatrical eyeroll during a long-winded question at a Beijing news conference stole the show during China's annual parliament session last week, exploding on Chinese social media before censors intervened. 
A video of the eyeroll became the source material for many parodies and satirical performances.
Despite strict censorship, China has a fairly lively online community of bloggers, who frequently respond to breaking events with humorous - and sometimes risqué - sketches and short videos, although they often face their posts being taken down.
JustXiait, a team of Chinese parody bloggers famous for satirical dubbed-over videos from movies, said in an official microblog post that the group would voluntarily delete all videos ""to conduct self-inspection, cleanup and improvement"".

The decision is ""to make the program more in line with relevant laws and regulations, and to provide audience more interesting and wholesome programs"", it said.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - A big rig hauling a load too tall to clear an underpass rammed the structure with such force that authorities had to close a major Alaska highway for repairs, causing a disruption rarely seen in the state's largest city - traffic gridlock.
The accident occurred Wednesday afternoon about 13 miles from central Anchorage on the Glenn Highway, the only road north out of the city and a route traveled by some 57,000 motorists a day, many commuting between downtown and outlying communities of Eagle River, Wasilla and beyond.
The crash of the too-tall tractor-trailer into the bottom of the bridge created an instant bottleneck that snarled traffic and disrupted school and government office schedules in a transportation calamity locals have dubbed “Bridgepocalypse.”
The consequences were fully felt during Thursday’s morning rush-hour. Highway traffic was detoured onto smaller community streets in Eagle River and alternative highway exit and entrance ramps, extending what is normally about a 20- or 30-minute commute by up to five hours. 
Schools delayed openings and the Anchorage School District canceled classes in Eagle River for Friday. State workers impacted by the road closure also were advised to stay home on Friday.
Damage from the crash, and resulting shutdown, was limited to the highway's southbound lanes, so northbound traffic was unaffected - with the caveat that anyone heading out of town was prevented from immediately coming back.
The closure is expected to last through Monday, said Shannon McCarthy, a state transportation department spokeswoman.
“What we don’t want is that span falling on commuters, or even part of it, because it’s like 200,000 pounds,” she said.
The agency was seeking $1.8 million in emergency funding to pull down and replace the damaged span, which McCarthy described as ""pulverized.""
In the meantime, Anchorage residents idled or slowed down by the disruption did their best to make light of the ordeal.
Bystanders waved signs, including one woman in a dinosaur suit who held a sign saying: “You’re almost there.”
Entrepreneurs hawked T-shirts proclaiming: “I survived the Bridgepocalypse.” Local kids set up a “Bridgepocalypse” hot cocoa and tea stand. 
On Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), one commuter likened the experience to being lost in space.
“Captain's log hour 2.5: Bladder filling. Food supply scarce. Caffeine supply empty. Slowly losing will to live. Good luck and Godspeed fellow travelers,” said a post by commuter Ryan Kelly.

It would be the second time in less than a year that Vietnam has had to cancel a major oil development in the South China Sea under pressure from China.
The move comes as Repsol was making final preparations for commercial drilling.
A rig, the Ensco 8504, was scheduled to depart from Singapore for the drill site on Thursday, the report said, citing an unnamed energy industry source. 
The cancellation could cost Repsol and its partners $200 million in sunk investment, according to the BBC.
Repsol and PetroVietnam executives could not immediately be reached for comment. The Vietnamese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
Red Emperor, known in Vietnamese as the Ca Rong Do field, is part of Block 07/03 in the Nam Con Son basin, 440 km (273 miles) off the coast of Vietnam's southern city of Vung Tau.
The block lies near the U-shaped ""nine-dash line"" that marks the vast area that China claims in the sea and overlaps what it says are its own oil concessions.
The field can produce 25,000-30,000 barrels of oil and 60 million cubic meters of gas a day, Vietnamese news provider Cafef.vn reported last month.
Repsol spent around 33 million euros ($41 million) on exploration in Vietnam last year, according to the company's 2017 profit and loss statement.
The Red Emperor site is considered by Repsol's top management as one of the company's future growth projects.
Repsol, which has a 51.75 percent stake in the project signed a 384 million euro rental contract for a rig to start work on a Vietnamese site in 2019, according to the statement.

Despite falling unemployment and a high profile internationally, the number of people with a favorable opinion of the 40-year-old former investment banker dropped three percentage points in March to 40 percent, the BVA poll showed.
That puts his popularity down 12 points since the end of last year, although it is no worse than it was for his predecessors Francois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy at the same point in their terms, BVA said.
Frustrated over Macron's wide-ranging labor and welfare reforms, nurses, teachers and other public sector workers walked off the job on Thursday over concerns about his plans to cut their headcount and introduce merit-based pay.
Protesters also want to derail Macron's plans to raise a special tax used to finance welfare which hits pensioners particularly hard, overhaul unemployment insurance and shake up the highly indebted state railway company.
Pensioners' higher tax bill appears to be frustrating an age group with which he has done well so far. His popularity with voters over 65 years old fell below 50 percent for the first time in March, dropping to 47 percent.
Macron was elected last May on promises to push through reforms his predecessors stopped short of, refusing to align himself with traditional parties on the left and right.
Opinion polls indicate that though a majority of voters backed Thursday's strike, an even bigger majority support the reforms.
The BVA poll was conducted among more than 1,000 people on Wednesday and Thursday for telecoms group Orange, RTL radio and website La Tribune. The margin of error is 2.5 percentage points.

623,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 11:50PM ET</span>",Mexican president defends energy reform from leftist's attacks,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's president on Thursday defended his decision to open the energy sector against attacks from the man currently favorite to succeed him, saying a rollback of the measure could cost the country billions of dollars in lost investment.
The 2013-14 legislative overhaul that ended state oil firm Pemex's decades-long monopoly was the centerpiece of President Enrique Pena Nieto's economic agenda, and leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is leading polls for the July 1 presidential election, has threatened to unpick it.
Speaking in the oil-rich state of Veracruz, Pena Nieto said those calling to walk back the reform risked condemning Mexico to an ""obsolete"" economic model, without naming Lopez Obrador.
""To cancel the energy reform is practically to make disappear the investments that today require certainty,"" Pena Nieto said at the inauguration of a technology center.
""We want ... the private sector to invest, for it to generate returns for Mexico and its people,"" he added.
Pena Nieto said over 800,000 jobs and $200 billion worth of investment ultimately depended on the energy reform's success.
He is barred by law from seeking re-election.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to review the oil and gas contracts awarded under Pena Nieto's government if elected, and on Wednesday evening said his administration would consider unwinding the energy reform legislatively.
Pena Nieto's reform changed the constitution to grant private operators oil and gas exploration and production rights in a bid to reverse years of declining crude output.
However, the reform coincided with a sharp decline in oil prices, and the government has said it will take time for the shake-up of the energy sector to bear fruit.
Pledging to reduce Mexico's dependence on policies ""sent from abroad"", Lopez Obrador has attacked Pena Nieto's economic agenda on the grounds that corruption is widespread.
Corruption scandals, lackluster growth and rising violence have battered the government's reputation.
Later on Thursday, Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell told local radio that to undo the energy reform would be ""extremely harmful"", and would make Mexico more dependent on natural gas imports, and deny it major tax revenues.

Joaquin Coldwell noted the only body authorized to revoke oil and gas contracts - provided serious violations are shown to have occurred - is the industry regulator, the National Hydrocarbons Commission, not the president.

The four countries have been at odds with Brussels over issues including immigration and fundamental rights, with the Slovak prime minister complaining in January they should not be treated as ""black sheep"" in the EU.
China has courted central and eastern European states, including with annual summits, which has fed concern in Western European capitals that Beijing is seeking to divide the continent.
Reuters earlier this month reported that China was considering paring back the summits, although China says preparatory talks for this year's summit in Bulgaria are continuing.
Meeting vice foreign ministers from the four countries in Beijing on Thursday, Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi said China appreciated the Visegrad countries' efforts to achieve win-win cooperation and common development with China and supports their participation in the Belt and Road Initiative.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The United States will deploy a record number of Marines to train in Australia, the Australian defense minister said on Friday, as Washington seeks to counter what it describes as Chinese aggression in the region.
Payne said 1,587 U.S. Marines will spend six months training in Australia's remote north, an increase of nearly 27 percent on its 2017 rotation for the program known as the Force Posture Initiatives.
""The U.S. military plays a vital role in underwriting security and stability across the Indo-Pacific, and the Force Posture Initiatives will be an essential component in preserving stability and security over the coming decades,"" Defence Minister Marise Payne said in a statement.
The deployment, first introduced in 2011 as part of a U.S. ""pivot"" to Asia, has emerged as a key indicator of Washington's commitment to the region under U.S. President Donald Trump and his willingness to counter Chinese influence in a region where tensions have spiked amid disputes over the South China Sea.
China claims most of the South China Sea, an important trade route that is also believed to contain large quantities of oil and natural gas, and has been building artificial islands on reefs, some with ports and air strips.
In a move likely to irk Beijing, the U.S. Marines will train with personnel from Australia, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, some of which also have claims in the South China Sea.
""China will monitor whatever the U.S. does and it would prefer that the United States not work with the Asian countries included in these exercises,"" said Euan Graham, director of the international security program at Australian think tank the Lowy Institute.
""Beijing would like to deal one-on-one with Southeast Asia nations that have counter claims,"" he said. 
The U.S. Marines will also bring additional military equipment, including helicopters and F-18 jets, Payne said.
The military deployment also threatens to further weaken Australia-Chinese relations.
Australia, a staunch U.S. ally with no claim to the South China Sea, has long maintained its neutrality in the dispute to protect its economic relationship with China.

But bilateral relations have soured in recent months after Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said China was improperly interfering in Canberra's affairs, an accusation that triggered a rare protest from Beijing.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May urged EU leaders to seize on ""a new dynamic"" in Brexit talks and solve differences over a future border with Ireland to agree a deal on their future partnership.
Leaders of the European Union are expected to sign off on Friday on an offer of a transition period and set out their terms for forthcoming talks on post-Brexit trade. At the end of a Thursday night summit dinner, May took to the floor to call on them not to squander that opportunity to reach an overall deal.
By securing agreement on a 21-month transition period to allow businesses to prepare after Britain leaves the bloc in March next year, May now faces possibly the hardest part of a negotiation that has already shaken her grip on power.
""We have the chance, now, to create a new dynamic in the talks to work together to explore workable solutions -- in Northern Ireland, in our future security cooperation and in order to ensure the future prosperity of all our people,"" she told the leaders at the end of a dinner of scallops and lamb.
""This is an opportunity it is our duty to take and to enter into with energy and ambition,"" she added, according to a senior British official.
May hopes the expected agreement by EU leaders on Friday will mark the start of the end of punishing talks, during which she has been criticized by some in her own party for giving too much away to Brussels and failing to take a tough enough stance. 
Some critics said the tone had been set for those talks when the lights went out at a meeting she had called with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss an attack on a former Moscow spy in the English city of Salisbury which Britain has blamed on Russia.
BORDER
May, under pressure from Brexit supporters in her Conservative Party for settling for a standstill transition with the EU when almost nothing changes, has long wanted to discuss future ties with the bloc, a conversation her government believes can settle some of the thorniest issues.
One such problem is the border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland, which has been all but invisible since a peace agreement was signed to end decades of sectarian conflict in the North. 
Both London and Brussels agree there should be no hard border, but they differ over how that can be achieved.
May has suggested a customs partnership or a streamlined arrangement, where jointly implemented measures and the use of technology minimize friction. EU officials reply by saying the easiest way to secure that would be to stay in its customs union -- something the British leader has ruled out.
The standoff has left a backstop agreement -- that could see the British province of Northern Ireland staying in the EU's customs union -- still in the transition text, although subject to negotiators finding an 'operational' compromise.
That, for some Brexit campaigners, is a major concern.
But a senior British official voiced confidence the difficulties over the border could be resolved now that the two sides were talking about the future. 

""Once we move on to this stage of being able to talk about the future relationship, that is where we believe the solution to the Irish border will be found,"" he told reporters. ""It will be a solution in terms of our entire relationship with the EU.""

BANDUNG, Indonesia (Reuters) - A spate of mysterious attacks on Islamic clerics, schools and mosques in Indonesia in recent weeks has ramped up tensions as the world's most populous Muslim-majority country heads into provincial elections and a presidential poll next year.
Intelligence and Islamic officials believe that political forces are behind what they describe as a shadowy ""black campaign"" designed to whip up fear that Islam itself is under siege under the leadership of President Joko Widodo.
In one town near the capital, Jakarta, a mosque manager was stabbed and a religious scholar received an anonymous letter warning that 10 clerics would be killed. Videos of what police say are fake attacks on Muslim clerics and schools have also been distributed on social media, heightening a mood of unease.
The attacks on the heavily populated island of Java have come as hardline Muslim groups press for a more conservative society and decry moderate politicians, posing a threat to Indonesia's reputation for tolerance and the democracy it won with the downfall of authoritarian President Suharto in 1998.
Indeed, there are echoes today of the panics stirred up by Suharto, which typically involved attacks on religious figures and institutions and sometimes a communist scare to discredit politicians. 
Elections are due across the country in June for dozens of governors, district heads and mayors. Analysts see those polls as an opening skirmish before 2019's battle for the presidency.
Ridwan Kamil, mayor of the city of Bandung and frontrunner to become governor of West Java province, says he has been hounded for months by hoax stories online that questioned the strength of his Islamic faith.
""If you are not a Muslim, they will label you an infidel. If you are Muslim, they will label you not Islamic enough,"" Kamil said of his opponents in an interview with Reuters, declining to identify them.
""They're trying to send a message ... that the country is not safe, that the government is failing, that we need to replace the existing government. Who gets the benefit? Whoever challenges Jokowi,"" he said, referring to President Widodo, whom he supports for re-election, by his nickname.
A CAMPAIGN TO SOW DISCORD
The potency of religion as a swing factor in elections was graphically illustrated last year when the popular governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, an ethnic-Chinese Christian and close ally of Widodo, lost his bid for re-election after being accused of insulting the Koran.
An online video of him speaking had been edited to make it seem that he was criticizing the Koran when in fact he was sniping at people who use a passage of Islam's holy book to warn Muslims against voting for non-Muslims.
Purnama's ouster was spearheaded by the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), a hardline group that organized huge protests against him in late 2016. He was later jailed for blasphemy.
Reuters investigations into the recent attacks in Java showed that the FPI has been involved in stoking the tensions.
National police chief Tito Karnavian says the wave of violence has not been ""massive or systematic"", and he blames online activists for ""spicing up"" anxiety among Muslims. There have only been three actual assaults and about 42 fake attacks were promoted online, he said.
Even so, intelligence officials, Islamic leaders and politicians say there is a concerted effort to sow discord through vandalism and threats to Islamic leaders, schools and mosques, reinforced through social media. Intelligence agency chief Budi Gunawan described it as a ""rampant black campaign"".
A leader of the Islamic Union, a mainstream organization known as Persis, was killed in the early hours of Feb. 1 by a man wielding an iron bar. Senior Persis leaders told Reuters that 22 of the group's schools, mosques and teachers had been vandalized or received abusive phone calls since that incident.
Someone, said Persis deputy chairman Jeje Zaenudin, is trying to ""provoke a reaction"".
Mahmud Syaltout, deputy secretary general of the youth wing of Indonesia's largest Muslim group, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), said NU schools and mosques have been targeted. 
One man who was caught vandalizing a mosque in East Java appeared to be healthy and feigning madness, he said.
Widodo's chief of staff, retired military chief Moeldoko, told local media someone was playing ""old games"", noting that deploying mentally ill people to create unrest was a tactic that harked back to the Suharto era.
RED SCARE
Pressed by Widodo, the NU and another moderate Islamic group, Muhammadiyah, have stepped up grassroots efforts to combat fundamentalist movements. According to a recent survey, nearly 20 percent of high school and university students support the establishment of an caliphate rather than a secular state.
On social media, much of the blame for the recent attacks has been laid on ""communists"" who - critics say have been allowed to flourish under Widodo and his left-leaning Indonesia Democratic Party-Struggle. 
The government and independent analysts have said there is no credible evidence of a revival of Indonesia's outlawed communist party (PKI), once the world's second-largest. The party was decimated after soldiers and Islamic vigilantes slaughtered - according to some estimates - at least 500,000 alleged leftists and their families in 1965. 
    Even so, Islamists, ultra-nationalists and elements of the military frequently warn of a resurgence. Analysts see the fomenting of a ""red scare"" as partly aimed at Widodo, a reformist and moderate who has often been falsely labeled by enemies as a descendant of communists.
Earlier this year, a homeless man, suspected of planning to attack a cleric at an Islamic boarding school in West Java, was beaten and accused of being a communist.
    The man was accosted by students as he paced up and down a lane by their school near the town of Bogor around 3 a.m. on Feb. 10, said Mahmud Mukhlis, one of the students.
    A pin was found inside the vagrant's bag that a local cadre of the FPI Islamic group declared was ""a symbol of the PKI"", Mukhlis said. The pin, viewed by Reuters, was in fact a name tag from a high school emblazoned with an eagle, Indonesia's national symbol.
    Members of FPI filmed the assault and shared the video on social media, said Mukhlis. 
Slamet Maarif, a spokesman for FPI, did not deny his group was behind the video. He said it needed to be proven that the homeless man's ""communist"" plot was a hoax, and described the incident as evidence of ""an awakening"" of the communist party.
""The government should be following up, and not accusing the people of spreading a hoax,"" Maarif said.
MUSLIM CYBER ARMY
    Police have arrested about 20 members of a network of online activists for spreading fake news about attacks on religious figures across Java. 
Known as the Muslim Cyber Army (MCA), the network was formed after the government shut down some of FPI's websites and social media accounts following anti-Purnama demonstrations in 2016.
Police say they are investigating who funds and directs the MCA. FPI leaders have frequently praised the network, and have urged police to stop harassing it.
For a decade, West Java province has been ruled by a coalition of nationalist and conservative Islamic parties that support Prabowo Subianto, a former Suharto-era special forces commander who lost the 2014 presidential election to Widodo.
In that contest, Widodo was buffeted by an online smear campaign that he came from a family of communists and had Chinese ancestry. Warnings of a communist comeback are often linked to a surge in Chinese investment and workers in Indonesia, part of Widodo's drive to revamp the country's crumbling infrastructure.
    Subianto is expected to again challenge Widodo, a moderate reformer currently riding high in opinion polls, in next year’s election.
    Subianto was buoyed by the victory of a candidate he backed in last year's Jakarta governor election, but his Gerindra party's contestant to become governor in West Java is well behind Kamil in opinion surveys.
    Gerindra's deputy secretary general, Ahmad Reza Patria, said the party had no links to the ""vile and extraordinary acts"" in Java. Subianto has not commented publicly on the incidents.
Bandung Mayor Kamil said he has stepped up security patrols in his city following the wave of attacks, but he is in no doubt that they are politically motivated.

""In my opinion, it is orchestrated,"" he said. ""It's not just a person, but an organization trying to benefit politically through fear.""

Former Mexico City Mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has a double-digit lead in polls for the July 1 election, has previously threatened to scrap the airport, which has been under construction since 2015 and is meant to be finished by 2020.
Lopez Obrador said the airport, the biggest public works project underway in Mexico, was running behind schedule and over budget, and that it could end up being a money pit for his administration if he wins office.
""We will present a legal challenge to stop contracts being awarded, because they are awarding contracts to tie down the next government,"" Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico City.
Earlier this month, the powerful CCE business lobby urged Lopez Obrador to respect the airport contracts or risk damaging investment in Latin America's No. 2 economy.
But he rejected such arguments about the airport, which is being built on the drained bed of Lake Texcoco by the capital.
""I consider the building of the airport to be corruption. And those defending the building of the airport in Lake Texcoco are involved in the business of corruption,"" Lopez Obrador said.
The company responsible for building the new airport, GACM, did not respond to a request for comment.
The CCE responded with a statement that said it believed the airport was indispensable for the country, and that all legal and transparency requirements should be met.
Lopez Obrador did not give details on how he believes the alleged corruption took place, and he dismissed concerns that halting the contracts could create uncertainty.
""Yes, that's what they say: uncertainty. But then what? To prevent uncertainty I'm going to become an accomplice to corruption? No. I'd prefer there to be uncertainty,"" he said.
The 64-year-old also said Mexico cannot afford the price tag on the new airport, and that the bed of Lake Texcoco is sinking.
Under his plans, the bonds issued to fund the airport would be guaranteed and existing contracts would not be affected, he says. The current airport should instead be kept and a small one further north of the city should be expanded, he argues.
That plan is not viable, the government says.
Federico Patino, the chief executive of GACM, told an infrastructure conference on Thursday, before Lopez Obrador's comments, that $6 billion had been raised through bonds and that the group was seeking a credit line of $1 billion.
CONTRACTUAL CRUNCH
If Lopez Obrador does win the election, it will raise serious questions about the future of the new airport and the significant investments already made in it.
Billions of dollars worth of contracts have been awarded for the airport, which aims to ease the strained capacity of the current hub and improve connectivity.
The largest existing contract by far was awarded to a consortium including a construction company controlled by Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim, one of the world's richest men.
The 85 billion peso ($4.6 billion) contract was for a group including Spain's Acciona, Slim's Operadora Cicsa and several Mexican firms, including builder ICA.
GACM is hoping to raise 30 billion pesos on Friday in an initial offering of an infrastructure investment trust to fund construction of the hub, whose planned terminal building was designed by British architect Norman Foster and Slim's son-in-law.
Runner-up in the last two presidential contests, Lopez Obrador has spent years railing against corruption. Public anger over graft scandals has battered the credibility of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.

630,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 07:50PM ET</span>",Saudi Arabia has options if U.S. walks from nuclear power deal: minister,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has international partners it can work with if the United States walks away from a potential deal on nuclear power technology over concerns about nuclear proliferation, Khalid al-Falih, the kingdom's energy minister, said in an interview on Thursday.
""If the U.S. is not with us, they will lose the opportunity to influence the program in a positive way,"" Falih said after he and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met this week with President Donald Trump, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and other officials on a range of issues. 
Perry has been quietly working with Saudi Arabia on a civilian nuclear agreement that could allow the kingdom to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium, technologies that nonproliferation advocates worry could one day be covertly altered to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. 
The kingdom is also in talks with companies from Russia, China, South Korea and other countries as the race to build two reactors in Saudi Arabia heats up. 
Saudi Arabia has said it needs nuclear power to move away from burning crude oil to generate electricity and to diversify its economy. Earlier this month, its cabinet approved a national policy program that limits nuclear activities to peaceful purposes. 
Perry hopes Saudi Arabia will buy nuclear power technology from U.S. companies, including Westinghouse, which went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy this year and abandoned plans to build two advanced AP1000 reactors in the United States. 
But Salman raised concerns when he told CBS in an interview on Sunday that the kingdom will develop nuclear weapons if its archrival Iran does so. 
Some members of the U.S. Congress worry the Trump administration is moving too quickly on a deal that could relax nonproliferation standards and one day help lead to a nuclear arms race across the Middle East.
If Saudi Arabia signs a deal that relaxes the safeguards, the UAE could be free to break its own deal it signed with Washington years ago and enrich uranium. The UAE deal contained the ""gold standard"" in such 123 nuclear agreements, because it contains the safeguards. 
On Wednesday, lawmakers from both parties in the U.S. House introduced a bill that would reform U.S. law to ensure that partners on nuclear energy abandon the pursuit of enriching uranium and reprocessing plutonium. The bill would also harden congressional approval of civilian nuclear deals.
Falih said he was hopeful for a deal with Washington. ""It will be natural for the United States to be with us and to provide us not only with technology, but to help us with the fuel cycle and the monitoring, and make sure we do it to the highest standard."" 
But the kingdom has generous uranium resources it wants to develop. ""It's not natural for us to bring enriched uranium from a foreign country to fuel our reactors,"" Falih said.
""The irony is that if the U.S. chooses not to (seal a deal) then somebody else will and we are fortunate to have many other alternative sources that have agreed to work with us and they will be competing for our program,"" Falih said. In that case, ""the U.S. will not have a seat at the table,"" he said.
Perry stuck a similar chord in comments during a congressional hearing on nuclear deals this week. ""It appears to me, either Russia or China is going to be a partner in building civil nuclear capability in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"" if the United States does not. 

Some nuclear analysts believe it is unlikely that the Saudis would choose to work with Russia because it has partnerships with nuclear projects in Iran.

631,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 07:40PM ET</span>",Peru's new president to replace PM in bid for consensus: sources,"By Mitra Taj and Marco Aquino
LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's incoming president Martin Vizcarra will replace the country's prime minister in a bid to form a consensus government with input from a broad representation of political groups and institutions, two sources close to Vizcarra told Reuters.
Prime Minister Mercedes Araoz will remain in her other position as vice president, the two sources and a third source close to Araoz said on Thursday. Araoz had previously vowed to resign the vice presidency out of loyalty to outgoing president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski if Congress forced him from office.
Vizcarra and Araoz did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Kuczynski tendered his resignation to Congress on Wednesday as an eleventh-hour vote-buying scandal destroyed his chances of surviving an impeachment vote and prompted a criminal probe. He denies any wrongdoing.
The move rallied markets, amid hopes that it would end months of political uncertainty in the top metals exporter. 
But Kuczynski's bitter battle with the opposition has fractured political parties, eroded trust in elected officials and sparked calls for new elections.
Vizcarra, first in line to replace Kuczynski as the country's first vice president, will be sworn in on Friday. 
In a bid to restore credibility in institutions while averting a fresh crisis, Vizcarra will ask different political and civil society groups to weigh in on important decisions, starting with a new Cabinet, the sources close to him said.
The sources close to Vizcarra said it was not clear if he would keep any ministers in the current Cabinet beyond a transitional period to ensure the government runs smoothly.
But they said Vizcarra definitely plans to replace Araoz, who has faced harsh criticism from lawmakers on the right and left as she has fought to help Kuczynski survive.
Having her remain outside the Cabinet, as one of Peru's two vice presidents, would give Vizcarra and Peru more stability, the three sources said.
The source close to Araoz said she had decided to remain as vice president because Kuczynski was departing voluntarily, not through a vote she would have considered a legislative coup.
Vizcarra and Araoz were elected together with Kuczynski in 2016, when they narrowly beat the presidential ticket of rightwing candidate Keiko Fujimori, the eldest daughter of former authoritarian president Alberto Fujimori.
Despite losing the presidency, Fujimori's party won control of Congress and forced at least three ministers in Kuczynski's government to resign.
Fujimori's party has promised to allow Vizcarra to govern Peru in peace through the rest of Kuczynski's scheduled term to 2021.

Vizcarra will arrive in Lima early on Friday from Canada, where he has doubled as Peru's ambassador.

The man was slightly burned and was treated at a local hospital, an official said. Local media said the incident took place outside an asylum office at Moria camp, which is a former military base set on a hilltop. Conditions there are poor.
At least 5,000 refugees and migrants are living in Moria and another camp on the island, more than their 3,000 capacity, awaiting for months for word on their future.
More than 60,000 refugees and migrants, most from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, have been in Greece for more than a year after border shutdowns throughout the Balkans halted the onward journey many planned to take to central and western Europe.
Lesbos was the main gateway to Europe in 2015 for nearly a million refugees and migrants and this month marks two years since the European Union and Turkey agreed to stem the flow.
Under the deal, migrants arriving n Greek islands must be returned to Turkey unless they qualify for asylum but processing papers can take months and protests over delays are common.

About a dozen asylum seekers were treated after clashes with police in Moria and about 200 women and children were evacuated to a nearby warehouse last week.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Technical problems will delay the completion of the Polish section of a U.S. defence shield by two years to 2020, Poland's defence ministry said on Thursday.
The anti-missile site close to Poland's northern Baltic Sea coast is part of a NATO defensive umbrella that, when complete, will stretch from Greenland to the Azores.
Poland's defence ministry said U.S. authorities had told it there had been construction delays at the Redzikowo site that were the responsibility of the contractor.
The U.S. head of the U.S. Missile Defence Agency (MDA), Lieutenant General Samuel Greaves, acknowledged the delay at a U.S. Senate hearing on Thursday.
The MDA, a unit of the U.S. Defence Department, is overseeing installation of the  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Co -made ground-based Aegis ballistic missile defence system.
""While we have experienced delays in the military construction portion of the Aegis Ashore effort in Poland, we remain steadfastly committed to delivery of that capability,"" Greaves said.
Officials from the U.S.-led NATO alliance, who took control of the umbrella in 2016, have said the whole system is supposed to defend against attacks by states such as Iran and groups such as al Qaeda. 
But the scheme has angered Russia, incensed by the show of force by its old Cold War rival in formerly communist Eastern Europe.
Poland's former defence minister, Tomasz Siemoniak, from the opposition Civic Platform (PO) party, said the delay was meant as a political rebuke to the current government.
""This is the price for the ... lack of trust in PiS (the ruling conservative Law and Justice party),"" Siemoniak told Reuters. 
Washington sharply criticised a bill that Poland adopted in January that imposes jail terms for suggesting Poland was complicit in the Holocaust, saying it was concerned about the repercussions it could have ""on Poland's strategic interests and relationships"".
Siemoniak said that ""in the context of the (Holocaust bill), the lack of trust has deepened ... 'Technical reasons' are just a pretext to postpone it until the year 2020. I am convinced that the situation is a result of the deterioration of the allied relations."" 
Bartosz Cichocki, a deputy foreign minister, told the PAP state news agency that there was no crisis in Polish-American relations and that the U.S. had informed Poland about the potential delay ""weeks before"" the Holocaust law was adopted. 
As part of the shield, the United States switched on an $800 million site in Romania in May 2016 and broke ground at the site in Poland later that year. 

The full shield also includes ships and radar installations across Europe, with command and control run from a U.S. air base in Germany.

The reporters photographed 17 people casting ballots more than once at three polling stations in Ust-Djeguta, a town in southern Russia.
Incumbent Vladimir Putin won the election in the country of roughly 144 million with 77 percent of the vote on a turnout of nearly 70 percent. Voting twice is a misdemeanor under Russian law and can lead to a fine.
Putin's opponents and independent election observers said officials loyal to Putin used tricks to inflate the turnout and this marred the vote.
Chairwoman of the Central Election Commission Ella Pamfilova said a local election commission had filed a lawsuit, which may challenge results at two out of three polling stations - 216 and 217 - where the reporters witnessed multiple voting.
""They filed a lawsuit to cancel election results at these polling stations,"" she told Reuters at a commission sitting.
Ludmila Sklyarevskaya, a deputy head of a local hospital, and Jamila Tebueva, a city administration employee, were among those seen voting more than once.
Larisa Abazalieva, the head of a local election commission, said via video link that Sklyarevskaya coordinated medical teams in charge of providing first aid at polling stations on the voting day and had a right to visit various polling stations in the area.
Abazalieva did not provide an explanation for why Sklyarevskaya was seen casting ballots twice.
Tebueva worked for a division in charge of bringing disabled and elderly voters to polling stations, Abazalieva said. She did not offer a reason why Tebueva has voted twice.
Both Tebueva and Sklyarevskaya denied to Reuters that they had voted more than once.
Reuters also uncovered a loophole in the voter registration system that could allow multiple voting. Three Reuters reporters obtained authorization to vote in more than one location and got the go-ahead by officials to vote a second time, although none of them did so.
Asked if the registration system needs to be changed, Pamfilova said that the system is ""wonderful"".

""It is absolutely new ... We are proud of our system. We do not need to reform it, we need to fine-tune it when defects are revealed,"" she said.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Catalan secessionist parties failed on Thursday for a third time to elect a regional president, leaving them with a deadline of two months to pick someone or hold a new election.
Jordi Turull, a close ally of former president Carles Puigdemont, needed 69 votes to be elected but obtained only 64.
Sixty-five lawmakers voted against him, while the four members of far-left group CUP broke ranks with the rest of parliament's pro-independence bloc by abstaining.
Catalonia has been in political limbo since Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy Madrid took over the wealthy northeastern region's government after a unilateral declaration of independence in October.
He called a December election in an attempt to derail the independence movement.
The plan backfired as parties favouring a split with Spain won the vote, though they have been unable to agree on a common strategy or elect a new regional president.
CUP backs outright independence while Catalonia's other secessionist parties are more favourable to engaging with central government in Madrid.
Puigdemont, and another ally who went with him into self-imposed exile in Brussels after last year's independence push unravelled, did not cast votes in the Turull election.
Turull could still be chosen in a second vote due to take place on Saturday when only a simple majority is needed, but it is unclear whether this will happen.
He was briefly held in custody on charges of rebellion and sedition after his involvement in the independence push in October. He was released on bail after accepting central government control over the region but still faces the prospect of a trial.
He and other secessionist leaders are due to appear before the Supreme Court on Friday morning for the opening of a new phase in the investigation which precedes a trial. 
The judge could declare him ineligible or even send him back to jail if he concludes that there is enough early evidence that he committed those crimes.
If Turull is not elected in a second vote or that vote does not take place, parties would have to elect another candidate within two months or hold another election, likely in early July.
Madrid has made clear it would stop any candidate who has taken part in the secessionist drive from taking office.

Puigdemont and Jordi Sanchez, a leader of a prominent grassroots group who is in jail over his role in the illegal campaign to split from Spain, have both withdrawn their bids for the presidency because they could not attend a swearing-in session.

The mission had already withdrawn most of its 15,000 troops in mid-2016, signaling that the poor West African nation can meet its own security needs. Some 2,000 U.N. forces had remained in case of an emergency, but over time they have pulled out.
""This mission contributed to the restoration of peace and stability in Liberia,"" President George Weah said in a joint address with visiting U.N. Deputy Secretary Amina Mohammed.
""We salute the men and women in blue helmets who came from far and near, some of whom paid the ultimate price for peace"".
Weah was sworn in to cheering crowds in January, a testimony to how far Liberia has come since its civil wars left almost 250,000 people dead and turned children into killers. He replaced outgoing Africa's first woman president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf after a hotly contested but nonetheless peaceful election a month earlier.
After being bogged down in quagmires such as Mali, Central African Republic and Congo, it was a welcome bit of good news for a U.N. peacekeeping mission to be able to leave a country in which peace is restored.
""The results were over time but there were 100,000 combatants disarmed and reintegrated,"" Mohammed told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""The youth are taking ownership as ... the custodians of peace.""
But she added that ""there's a lot of consolidation that needs to be done.""

Namal, who was in Russia to monitor the presidential election, was to fly to Houston from Moscow late on Wednesday. 
""When I went to check into the flight in Moscow, I was told that U.S. Home Office (State Department) had informed not to allow me to enter the U.S.. No reason was given,"" Namal told Reuters via phone. He said he had a valid multiple-entry visa for the United States. 
""There was no travel ban on me and I was to attend my aunt's funeral. The U.S. has the right to refuse my entry, but they could have informed me earlier,"" he said. 
A spokesperson at the U.S. Embassy in Sri Lanka said the U.S. law prohibits the country's officials from discussing individual visa cases.
Junior Rajapaksa's passport was impounded as part of a probe into an alleged money laundering, state media has reported. 
But he was granted permission to travel abroad for a period of two months by the Colombo Chief Magistrate on Feb. 22 to travel Russia and Nepal for two months from Feb. 26 to attend seminars organized by Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.
Namal is facing legal battles including misappropriation of funds in an apartment project and is on bail after being arrested in July 2016. He was questioned by financial police investigating a $650-million high-end project in the capital Colombo. 
He had denied any wrongdoing and said the government was on a witchhunt against its political rivals instead of delivering on its promise of good governance.
Since he swept to power in January 2015, President Maithripala Sirisena has launched a series of investigations into deals that were cleared by his predecessor Rajapaksa and his family members, some of whom were in the cabinet.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With large protests for stricter gun laws planned nationwide on Saturday, the U.S. Congress is expected to approve a massive spending bill this week with grants to help schools prevent gun violence, improvements to background checks and an assurance that a key government agency can conduct related research.
The provisions are Congress' response to intensified public anger and frustration over mass shootings and follow the Feb. 14 massacre at a Florida high school in which 17 people died.
But the narrowly tailored action falls short of the type of comprehensive legislation gun control advocates and many Democrats say is needed to stop the shooting deaths of school children, concert-goers, church worshipers and others.
""We made incremental but important progress on the issue of gun violence, a debate that this Congress must soon continue,"" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters, saying ""America has changed on guns.""
Many Democrats support closing a loophole that allows individuals to skirt government background checks by purchasing weapons at gun shows or over the internet, raising the minimum age to buy a weapon and banning assault-style rifles.
Congress is expected to approve the $1.3 trillion package this week and send it to President Donald Trump to be signed into law before a Friday deadline to fund the government.
The deal contains a bipartisan measure to give states additional funds to comply with the National Instant Criminal Background Check system, an FBI database that screens potential gun buyers.
It also includes $50 million annually in grant money for states to help schools better identify and respond to gun violence.
""The calls from the American people to address gun violence in our schools and communities have been deafening,"" No. 2 Senate Republican John Cornyn said in a statement. ""Fixing the background check system will help save lives.""
There is also language clarifying that a 1996 amendment passed by Congress, after lobbying by the National Rifle Association, prohibiting the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) from using appropriated funds to ""advocate or promote gun control"" does not bar the agency from studying the causes of gun violence.
The 1996 amendment has had a chilling effect on CDC research. Trump's Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Congress last month he believed the CDC still had the authority to research gun violence.

""Just over a month after 17 innocent people were killed ... the American people have been screaming from the rooftops for real, bold change to fight against such tragedies. And this is just not enough,"" Kris Brown, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said in a statement on the spending bill.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and rightist parties are looking to wrap up a deal on who should be appointed as speakers for the new parliament, which opens on Friday after this month's inconclusive elections.
However, the much more arduous task of creating a possible coalition government has yet to begin, with political sources saying serious negotiations might have to wait until after regional elections slated for the end of April.
Decisions on who should preside over the upper and lower houses is often seen as a precursor to eventual government accords, but the March 4 election threw up such a confused parliament that no-one is taking any bets on future pacts.
""I don't think it is possible to predict an outcome (for the government) and anyone who says they have the solution and they know how this story is going to end is lying,"" said Giovanni Orsina, professor of history at Luiss University in Rome.
A conservative alliance, including the far-right League and former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!), emerged as the biggest single bloc in the election while 5-Star was crowned the largest party in Italy.
Initial contacts between these two winning groups have resulted in an unwritten deal that should see a 5-Star politician elected as speaker of the lower house, while the right will scoop up the presidency of the upper house Senate.
If all goes according to plan, the ballots in the two chambers could be wrapped up by the start of next week, opening the way for President Sergio Mattarella to start formal consultations on creating a new government.
COMPROMISES
The speaker deal could yet fall apart, however, with the conservative bloc putting forward Forza Italia veteran Paolo Romani, who has a conviction for embezzlement, as its candidate for the Senate presidency. 
The 5-Star, whose slogan is 'Honesty', has baulked at his nomination. ""The center-right is continuing to propose Romani who we cannot vote for,"" 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), calling on parties to discuss the issue.
Unless a compromise is found quickly, the voting process in parliament could drag on for days, delaying the launch of the official coalition discussions.
Even if consultations with Mattarella start promptly, no one is expecting a swift breakthrough, with attention shifting to local elections in the regions of Fruili-Venezia-Giulia and Molise, currently run by the center-left Democratic Party (PD).
The PD has governed Italy since 2013 but lost badly in the national election, punished by voters for the slow pace of economic recovery. It looks highly likely to lose the regional votes too, with 5-Star and the right fighting for the spoils.
""Any government deal will involve compromises and come at a big political cost. Who will want to pay that cost before the regional elections?"" said a senior politician in the League, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The three main coalition options would see the PD supporting either 5-Star or the right, or else the 5-Star and right getting together. But there is no natural fit between the three blocs and years of fierce mutual animosity to overcome.
If no compromise deal is found, the president could try to cobble together a government of technocrats with a limited mandate or else order new elections in the autumn. For now, Italy's markets show little concern over the uncertainty.

""The present situation ... is relatively stable, so if there are no major external shocks I don't think the markets should worry at all in the coming months,"" Orsina said.

As Jobbik has steadily abandoned far-right views on Europe, immigration and other issues, Orban's ruling Fidesz party has moved sharply to the right with talk of preserving Hungary's ""ethnic homogeneity"" and comparing the EU to the Soviet Union.
In power since 2010, Fidesz remains well ahead of its rivals in opinion polls but millions of Hungarians are still undecided about whom to support in the April 8 election and Jobbik's newly moderate tone appeals to many voters.
""This (change) suits me better, I like it better than when it was mocked as a Nazi party,"" said Dezso Borbas, 60, a Jobbik voter in the western Hungarian city of Nagykanizsa.
In Nagykanizsa, as in many districts around the country, the Jobbik candidate is head-to-head with the Fidesz incumbent.
Jobbik chairman Gabor Vona exuded confidence at a recent rally in Budapest.
""We are not afraid of Orban,"" he said. ""The outgoing premier will be relegated to the dark pages of history. After 8 April, he will fall.""
Opinion polls currently put Jobbik in second place, at 12-14 percent against about 30 percent for Fidesz. But some pollsters say support for Fidesz may be exaggerated as some Hungarians are wary about publicly expressing opposition to it.
""I expect Jobbik to deliver a surprise result compared to the opinion polls, with a much stronger, better result at the elections,"" said Tamas Boros, a political analyst at the Policy Solutions think-tank.
""That does not mean it would win the elections or that the government would be replaced, but Jobbik will visibly become by far the strongest opposition party.""
Jobbik currently has 24 seats in the 199-member parliament, while Fidesz has 131 and the Socialists 28. The Socialists have been in disarray in recent months and are expected to lose seats.
Boros said Jobbik could attract many undecided voters, who account for about another third of the electorate. Some may not want to admit in surveys to supporting Jobbik because of the party's hardline past, analysts say.
CHANGE OF HEART
Jobbik has stepped up its attacks on official graft and cronyism and has called for bigger efforts to tackle social inequality in Hungary and to reverse an exodus of workers to wealthier countries in western Europe.
Under Orban, annual economic growth has returned to around 4 percent in recent years, but the EU and human rights groups accuse him of undermining media freedoms and judicial independence and steering Hungary toward authoritarianism. 
Ironically Fidesz now sounds very much like the old Jobbik with its fierce criticisms of the EU and immigration.
Senior Jobbik politician Marton Gyongyosi said he was ""horrified"" by how Fidesz had adopted elements of his party's former program and pushed them to an extreme.
He said Orban's demonizing of Hungarian-born billionaire philanthropist George Soros was ""insane"". Orban has accused Soros of seeking to flood Europe with Muslim migrants, a charge the businessman strongly rejects.
""You might oppose many things George Soros stands for, including liberal ideology or liberal social theory, but you cannot have this type of hate campaign against an individual or against an ideology,"" Gyongyosi said.
Like his party, Gyongyosi, a suave businessman educated in Ireland, has moved a long way in the past few years. In 2012 he caused outrage by calling for a list of lawmakers with a Jewish background, but he subsequently said he had ""misspoken"" and that he now regarded such talk as dangerous.
""This is the first election where we can put the whole new strategy and paradigm shift of this party to the real test,"" he said. ""It is a huge test for Jobbik.""
Jobbik is focusing on a ""Top 40"" constituencies, all of them outside Budapest and mostly in rural areas, Gyongyosi said, allowing leftist and green candidates to focus their energies on unseating Fidesz in urban areas.
He predicted that his party could win up to 100 seats in the new parliament - a tall order, according to political analyst Boros, who said Jobbik could nevertheless continue to build up its support and become a contender for power in the future.
Jobbik chairman Vona ruled out any future coalition with either Fidesz or the Socialists, but also signaled it might cooperate with smaller parties such as the young liberals' Momentum Movement or the green LMP.
The election race has been jolted by a by-election last month, in which an political novice backed by the entire opposition easily beat the Fidesz candidate for mayor in Hodmezovasarhely, a rural bastion of Orban's party.

""There are technical opportunities there to (beat) Fidesz in a national election as well,"" Gyongyosi said. ""We just have to find a way to do it.""

Putin, fresh from an election victory granting him his fourth term and extending his leadership of Russia by six years, called Bashir on Thursday to discuss bilateral relations, SUNA said.
Bashir congratulated Putin who affirmed his country's commitment to investing in Sudan's energy, oil, gas, and gold mining sectors.
""The president extended an invitation to the Russian president to visit Sudan and discuss developing relations and building a strategic partnership and Putin accepted the invitation,"" SUNA said. It provided no date for the visit.
Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court in the Hague for genocide and crimes against humanity in Sudan's Darfur region, and is mostly shunned by Western leaders.
Sudan will sign a ""roadmap"" with Russia to build nuclear power stations during a visit to Moscow by Khartoum's electricity minister, SUNA reported earlier this month.

645,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Italy's defeated left divided over post-election role,"By Gavin Jones and Massimiliano Di Giorgio
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's ruling Democratic Party (PD), already reeling from a bruising election defeat, is now grappling with another challenge: deep divisions over whether to go into opposition or act as king-maker for one of its adversaries.
The hung parliament produced by the national elections earlier this month means the PD could hold the key to a swift resolution by allowing either the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement or a centre-right bloc to form a government.
But conversations with more than half a dozen parliamentarians in the centre-left PD, including some members of the outgoing government, show the party is split into various factions over which direction to take.
The weakening of the PD, which for over two decades has been the main counterweight to the billionaire media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, is viewed with concern in many European capitals because it could undermine the stability of the euro zone.
The 5-Star Movement and the far-right League, which emerged as the largest party in the conservative coalition, have in the past called for Italy to leave the single currency. The popularity of both parties is partly based on their hostility to EU rules on public finances, trade and immigration.
The 81-year-old Berlusconi fared less well than expected in the election but remains a central player and his party could still have an important role in government.
Some PD insiders say they support former party leader Matteo Renzi, who has called for tough opposition, saying the PD had nothing in common with ""extremist"" parties like the League and 5-Star. 
But a refusal by the PD to participate in government could result in there being no coalition deal, triggering a rapid return to the ballot box at a time when opinion polls suggest the party could suffer even steeper electoral losses. 
Other PD politicians say they want to find common ground with 5-Star, by far the biggest party following the election, to keep from power the far-right parties in the Conservative bloc. 
That approach has received public support from some influential leftist figures inside and outside the party, such as former PD leader Walter Veltroni.
But by supporting a government led by another party, the PD would risk not getting the credit for popular policies while facing blame if things go wrong.
The party's dilemma mirrors that of Germany's Social Democrats (SPD), which after lengthy internal debate following a similarly humiliating poll defeat, decided this month to join the government led by Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU).
Some PD members express hope the political impasse eventually yields a role for the PD in a broad, multi-party coalition, which would allow them to remain in power on a more equal footing than a tie-up with just 5-Star or the centre-right. 
""Whatever path we take risks having negative consequences,"" said one PD member of the government, who added that he thought the party would eventually do a policy deal with 5-Star similar to the SPD-CDU arrangement in Germany. 
The PD politicians that spoke to Reuters asked not to be named, a sign of the mutual mistrust that now reigns in the party's ranks.
""TOTAL DISARRAY""
Adding to the PD's predicament is what political analysts say is a leadership vacuum. Following Renzi's resignation after the election, the party is currently headed by the low-profile Maurizio Martina, who was Renzi's second-in-command. However, the 39-year-old former agriculture minister shows little sign of being able to unite its disoriented troops.
""The PD is in total disarray, it doesn't have a leader or a plan or a strategy,"" said Giovanni Orsina, politics professor at Rome's LUISS University.
A spokeswoman for Martina didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Formal consultations on forming a government are expected to start in April, when party delegations will meet with 76-year-old President Sergio Mattarella, who will try to broker a deal.
Talks could go on for weeks or even months, which would give the PD plenty of time to lick its wounds and regroup.
Some analysts believe Mattarella, a former PD member who has urged all groups to show ""a sense of responsibility,"" will lean on his old party to participate in helping to form a government.
""The day after the election the PD was adamant it would go into opposition, but they are shifting that position by a millimetre every day and Mattarella hasn't even started persuading them yet,"" said Marco Travaglio, the editor of daily Il Fatto Quotidiano and a prominent political commentator.
The PD took just 18.7 percent of the vote at the March 4 election, 14 points behind 5-Star and even further behind the conservative coalition in which the League got 17.4 percent.
The defeat followed a string of PD setbacks in local votes since it won a record 41 percent at European elections in 2014 under Renzi, then its seemingly invincible new leader. On that occasion 5-Star won 21 percent and the League got 6 percent. 
BITTER RESIGNATION
In a bitter resignation speech Renzi hit out at the League and 5-Star for their attacks during the election campaign and left no doubt over which direction he wanted the PD to take.
""If we are mafiosi, if we are corrupt and unworthy of running as candidates, if our hands are covered in blood, you know what? Form a government without us,"" he said. 
Piero Ignazi, a politics professor at Bologna University, said the centre-left would be ""crazy"" to play second fiddle in any government because junior partners often suffer subsequent electoral losses. He cited Germany's SPD, who governed with the CDU between 2013 and 2017, and Britain's Liberal Democrats, who ruled with the Conservative Party from 2010-2015, as evidence.
However, LUISS professor Orsina said early elections were a risk the PD couldn't afford, and argued that the party would not necessarily be penalised by cooperation with the 5-Star.
""The 5-Star Movement is very inexperienced and if the PD got some authoritative figures in the cabinet it could take an increasingly influential role and improve its image,"" he said.
Whatever the PD does, it risks further internal fractures like the one it suffered before the election when a group of leftists jumped ship complaining Renzi had moved the party to the right, said Orsina.

""I think in the end they will decide to join a government with 5-Star,"" he said. ""But the problem is whether they will stay united, and I see a big risk of another split.""

Lee was grilled by prosecutors earlier this month over nearly 20 charges that involve suspicions he took around 11 billion won ($10.28 million) unlawfully from a number of institutions and individuals He denies any wrongdoing.
A South Korean judge issued the arrest warrant late on Thursday, saying Lee could destroy evidence. The former president was driven to a detention center in Seoul soon after midnight.
Lee, in office from 2008 to 2013, says the investigation into the bribery allegations is politically motivated by prosecutors under the incumbent liberal administration.

Last year, Lee's successor ex-president Park Geun-hye was ousted from office after an influence-peddling scandal and is standing trial on charges of bribery, abuse of power and coercion. South Korean prosecutors are seeking a 30-year jail term for Park and a Seoul court will deliver a verdict in early April.

COPENHAGEN/BEIJING (Reuters) - Greenland is courting Chinese investors and construction companies to help expand three airports, raising concern in the Danish government that Chinese involvement could upset its ally, the United States.
Chinese interest in Greenland, a self-ruling part of the Kingdom of Denmark, comes after Beijing in January laid out ambitions to form a ""Polar Silk Road"" by developing shipping lanes opened up by global warming and encouraging enterprises to build infrastructure in the Arctic.
Greenland, also eager to benefit from growing activity in the Arctic, plans to expand the airports in the capital Nuuk, the tourist hub in Ilulissat and at Qaqortoq in southern Greenland to allow direct flights from Europe and North America.
The island lacks simple infrastructure for its tiny population of only 56,000, has no roads between the country's 17 towns and, for now, only one commercial international airport, at Kangerlussuaq, western Greenland.
During a visit headed by Greenland's Premier Kim Kielsen to Beijing late last year, the delegation met representatives of engineering and construction company China Communications Construction Co (CCCC) and Beijing Construction Engineering Group (BCEG).
Now, Chinese construction companies have appeared on a list of 11 companies or consortia that have shown interest in the projects with an estimated cost of 3.6 billion Danish crowns ($595 million), according to Kalaallit Airports, a state-owned company set up to build, own and operate the airports.
Other interested companies are from Denmark, Iceland, Canada, the Netherlands and the Faroe Islands, the company's chairman Johannus Egholm Hansen told Reuters. 
The company expects to shortlist five or six of them this month or next and begin construction in October, he said. 
Greenland's government declined to comment on the Chinese interest. 
Greenland says it can finance 2.1 billion crowns, but will need external funding for the remaining 1.5 billion.
""Our visit to China should be viewed in the context of seeking funding to these future investments,"" Kielsen said during the visit to Beijing, following meetings with the Export-Import Bank of China (EXIM).
EXIM, CCCC and BCEG did not reply when contacted via email and fax.
STRONG OPPOSITION
Chinese activity in Greenland is met with strong opposition in Copenhagen. A defense treaty between Denmark and the United States dating back to 1951 gives the U.S. military almost unlimited rights in Greenland, site of Thule air base.
""We are deeply concerned. China has no business in Greenland,"" a high-ranking Danish government official in Copenhagen told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
""Denmark has a big responsibility to live up to with regards to our closest ally, the United States,"" the person said.
While Greenland's self-rule authority decides on most domestic matters, foreign and security policy is handled by Copenhagen. Foreign investment in infrastructure projects is a gray zone, but if China is involved, Copenhagen holds the right to say no, the government source said.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen, Defence Minister Claus Hjort Frederiksen and Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen all declined to comment.
The U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen also declined immediate comment.
""It's obvious that the United States doesn't want a superpower like China to have such large-scale access to Greenland,"" Soren Espersen, spokesman for foreign and security affairs of the Danish People's Party, a key ally of the minority government, told Reuters.
""Denmark cannot play on two horses. The government in Copenhagen has to stop the Chinese plans, because if it doesn't, the United States will,"" he said.
In 2016, the Danish government on direct orders from Washington prevented a Chinese investor from buying a former marine station in southern Greenland, according to sources.
Trade tensions between the United States and China have been rising and Beijing was bracing on Thursday for an announcement from U.S. President Donald Trump of tariffs of as much as $60 billion on Chinese imports.
""In Greenland we don't suffer from China anxiety, like they obviously do in the government in Copenhagen,"" Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, member of the Danish parliament for Greenland and head of Greenland's foreign affairs committee, told Reuters.
""They lack an understanding for Greenland's need for investments, and we can sense a big interest in China for our projects,"" she said.
China's foreign ministry said in a faxed statement it has ""no understanding of the situation"" mentioned.
""At present, China and Denmark's all-round strategic partnership relationship is developing thoroughly, and China has a good cooperative relationship with Denmark's autonomous territory Greenland,"" the ministry said.
""The Chinese government encourages and supports relevant companies to participate in the development and use of the Arctic in accordance with lawful, green, cooperative and market principles,"" it said.
A U.S. State Department official said that ""we welcome efforts by all countries, including China, to enhance investment in high-quality infrastructure development,"" but urged that ""development financing should not be predatory or result in unsustainable debt."" 
Greenland, with vast mineral resources including uranium and rare earths, is strategically important for the U.S. military as the shortest route from North America to Europe goes via the Arctic island.
Thule air base, located 1200 kms (750 miles) north of the Arctic Circle, includes a radar station that is part of a U.S. ballistic missile early warning system.

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Two roommates of the 23-year-old man behind this month's deadly bombing spree that unnerved Austin have been questioned and released from custody, police in the Texas capital said on Thursday.
The move came as law enforcement officials searched for what motivated Mark Conditt, an unemployed man from the Austin suburb of Pflugerville, to commit the attacks that killed two people. Authorities are also anxious to learn whether anyone helped him build or plant his bombs.
Police say Conditt confessed to a three-week string of bombings in a 25-minute video made on his cellphone hours before he blew himself up, as law enforcement closed in on him Wednesday.
One of the two roommates was questioned and released on Wednesday and the other released after that. Police did not say exactly when the second roommate was freed. 
""Their names will not be released because they are not under arrest at this time,"" the department said on its Twitter feed.
Conditt's bombs, which also injured five people, primarily targeted Austin. Three were left as parcels outside victims' homes, one by a sidewalk with a trip-wire mechanism attached and two shipped as FedEx (NYSE:FDX) parcels, which helped investigators unmask the bomber's identity.
""Even though the bomber's dead, our focus is to ensure that he wasn't working with anyone else,"" said Michelle Lee, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation's San Antonio office. 
The second and third bombs went off while Austin was hosting its annual South by Southwest music, movies and tech festival, which draws about half a million people.
The confession video showed a troubled young man, police said, but did not outline a clear motive for the attacks that began March 2.
""We may never get a clear picture of what motivated the Austin bomber,"" Fred Burton, chief security officer for security consultancy Stratfor, said in a phone interview. 
Austin police were unlikely to make the video public while the investigation continued, said spokeswoman Destiny Wilson.
Investigators sought further clues on Thursday from the Pflugerville home Conditt shared with his roommates. Bomb-making material was found in a room there.

Conditt and his three siblings were home-schooled through high school, his mother wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). He attended classes at Austin Community College between 2010 and 2012, but did not graduate.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - A U.N. peacekeepers' camp near Kidal in Mali came under rocket fire on Thursday, the U.N. mission said, shortly before a visit by the prime minister, the first to the northern city by a top government official for four years.
Soumeylou Boubeye Maiga and eight of his ministers are due in Kidal as part of a nine-stop national tour. The city and the province of the same name, the country's most rebellious, have been under Tuareg control since an uprising in 2012.
""I am headed to Kidal,"" Maiga said on Twitter before his departure, giving no scheduled arrival time.
The West African country, which is mostly desert, is due to hold a presidential election on July 29, but there are concerns that widespread security problems will prevent the vote from going ahead.
Maiga's itinerary includes other places in the north and center that have been troubled by rebellion or Islamist insurgency, including Gao, Timbuktu and Mopti.
During Moussa Mara's visit to Kidal city in 2014, the most recent by a serving prime minister, a gun battle between the Malian army and Tuareg separatists killed at least 50 soldiers and forced state governor Sidi Mohamed Ag Ichrach to flee.
Ichrach was allowed to return to Kidal last year following a ceasefire deal signed between competing Tuareg clans, but it remains de facto under the control of separatists.
Mali descended into turmoil when Islamist fighters and Tuareg-led rebels in 2012 seized control of the country's north. 
France poured in hundreds of troops to push back the insurgents in 2013, but attacks have been spreading further south, despite the U.N. peacekeeping mission.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's parliament has approved a bill granting the radio and television watchdog authority to regulate online content, fuelling concerns about further restrictions on the media.
The move closes a loophole under which some Turkish broadcasters have sought refuge from censorship and strict regulations by moving to online streaming platforms.
It follows sharp criticism by rights groups and Turkey's Western allies of restrictions on the media following the 2016 failed coup against President Tayyip Erdogan.
Two local streaming websites, PuhuTV and BluTV, have produced popular shows in the past year whose content and language would likely be censored if broadcast on television. 
PuhuTV's thriller about a psychologist who falls in love with a dancer includes strong language and erotic scenes that would not be screened on Turkish television.
The worldwide streaming service Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is also currently working on a show with Turkey's TV industry.
The bill requires broadcasters wishing to stream content online to be licensed by the RTUK watchdog, subjecting them to the same criteria as TV broadcasters. RTUK will be able to report unlicensed shows to a criminal court which can ban them.
""A possibility is being created for institutions wishing to stream radio and television content only over the internet to receive a license for only this purpose,"" the law reads, adding that these broadcasters currently avoid content regulation as well as taxes.
""This way, the broadcasts in question will be subject to the same content supervision by RTUK as those broadcasts on landline, satellite and cable.""
In the past, RTUK has censored, fined or halted shows and other programs for inappropriate content - usually due to coarse language, sexual content or the consumption of alcohol and tobacco products.
LICENSING
A member of the RTUK board from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) said the licensing process had been made more difficult by a recent decree that requires the approval of the license by the National Intelligence Agency (MIT) and the Security General Directorate (EGM).
Licences for pro-government organizations are approved far quicker than potential critics, Ismet Demirdogen told Reuters. ""There are license requests that have been on hold for a year and a half.""
Turkey's post-coup crackdown has seen dozens of independent media outlets shut down for what the government says are links to terrorism. The Turkish Journalists Association says that as of January, there were 154 journalists in jail.
The bill was passed late on Wednesday, hours before business group Dogan Holding confirmed it had started talks to sell its $890 million media arm to the pro-government Demiroren Holding, a deal seen as further cementing media support for Erdogan.
Baris Yarkadas, a CHP lawmaker, said the sale of Dogan media group, as well as the passing of the new law, were an attempt by the AKP to ""tighten the screws"" before presidential and parliamentary elections next year.
""The ruling party does not want to leave any media space for the opposition to express itself ahead of the elections.""

There was no immediate comment from Saudi authorities about the report, which was carried by Houthi TV al-Massirah and the Houthi-controlled news agency SABA.
The report did not identify the facility that was targeted in Najran, where Aramco has some offices and a loading facility.
The Iranian-aligned Houthis have launched scores of missiles at the kingdom - causing little serious damage - since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015.
The coalition moved in after the armed Houthi movement drove Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile in Riyadh.

PARIS (Reuters) - Two rights groups have given the French government two months to halt weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates or face legal action, adding to pressure on President Emmanuel Macron to scale back support of a Riyadh-led offensive in Yemen.
The action comes as some European states, notably Germany, have curtailed ties with the Saudi-led military coalition due to concerns over its role in Yemen's civil war. France, Britain and the United States have not followed suit. 
France, the world's third-biggest arms exporter, counts Saudi Arabia and the UAE among its biggest purchasers, and France's biggest defense firms, including Dassault and Thales, have major contracts in the Gulf.
Droit Solidarite, a legal NGO, and Aser, which specializes in armament issues, argue that France is violating national and international law by selling arms that are being used in the conflict in Yemen.
The United Nations and rights groups accuse the coalition of targeting civilians, which amounts to a war crime. The coalition denies this. 
""France is not respecting its international commitments,"" Aser's president, Benoit Muracciole, told Reuters.
Lawyers acting for the two NGOs sent a letter to the office of Prime Minister Edouard Phillipe demanding the export licenses to be suspended.
If the French government does not meet their deadline, Aser and Droit Solidarite will take their case to the Conseil d'Etat, France's highest legal authority. 
""We will go to the Council of State from May 1 if there is an explicit or implicit refusal of the government to respond,"" he said.
The Saudi-led coalition is fighting on the side of an internationally recognized Yemeni government against the Iran-aligned Houthi group.
Since the war began in 2015, more than 10,000 people have been killed, at least three million others displaced and Yemen has been plunged into a multi-fronted humanitarian disaster. 
In recent years, Riyadh has bought French tanks, armored vehicles, munitions and artillery, while the UAE purchased fighter jets. 
Amnesty International and French rights group ACAT published a legal report on Monday warning France and its weapons suppliers faced potential legal risks over their dealings with Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
Unlike many if its allies, French export licensing procedures have no parliamentary checks or balances. They are approved through a committee headed by the prime minister that includes the foreign, defense and economy ministries.
Details of licenses are not public and once approved are rarely reviewed.
""Arms sales in France are governed by very strict procedures of state control,"" the prime minister's office said. It confirmed receipt of the letter.
In 2016, licenses potentially worth 45 billion euros ($55.45 billion) to the two countries were approved with deliveries worth about 2 billion euros.

""French military equipment exports are totally controlled by the state,"" a Dassault spokesman said. Thales declined to comment.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain is seeking help from other European countries to take action against Russian spy networks that could be preparing similar attacks to the nerve agent assault on a former Russian spy in England, diplomats said.
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May will urge joint action among European Union states at a summit in Brussels on Thursday, where she will also try to persuade the bloc's leaders to condemn Russia squarely over the attack in Salisbury.
""Russia staged a brazen and reckless attack against the United Kingdom,"" May told reporters on arriving at the summit.
""It's clear that the Russian threat does not respect borders and indeed the incident in Salisbury was a pattern of Russian aggression against Europe and its near neighbors.""
May accused Russia of the first known offensive use of a nerve toxin in Europe since World War Two after Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent, and his daughter were found unconscious on a public bench in the English city on March 4.
In the worst crisis between the two powers since the Cold War, May has expelled 23 Russian diplomats whom she says were spies working under cover. Moscow, which has denied involvement in the attack, has taken retaliatory steps.
Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said she was already considering expelling Russian spies from her territory. 
""Britain says there are these networks that organize such things like Salisbury, that these networks exist across our borders and that it would be good to go after them together,"" a senior EU diplomat said. ""They have been approaching EU states on that bilaterally and today May will tell EU leaders more.""
Diplomats stressed May was not seeking a formal or immediate EU strategy because the bloc has little joint competence on intelligence, meaning any such work would be done directly with other governments.
""There is movement among several willing states to do something together in reaction to Skripal,"" said another EU diplomat, adding that this would be done bilaterally outside the EU so as not to press too hard those members of the bloc who are more worried about their ties with Moscow.
Reluctance from countries - Greece and Hungary among them - means a draft joint statement by EU leaders now says only that they take ""extremely seriously"" London's assessment that it was highly likely Russia was responsible for the attack.
But May will push fellow EU leaders to blame Moscow directly for the poisoning of the Skripals who British authorities say have been critically ill since the attack by a Soviet-produced military-grade nerve agent called Novichok. 
Russia's ambassador to London on Thursday said that, had Novichok been used, the Skripals would have died. 
European Council President Donald Tusk, who will chair the summit and has sided with Britain, said: ""It is clear we should improve our preparedness for future attacks.""
He wants the bloc to discuss how to better protect itself from chemical and biological attacks, including in cooperation with NATO, as well as to how to beef up counter-intelligence capabilities to combat hybrid threats.
PROOF
A British official confirmed London was seeking to work with groups of countries on intelligence-sharing over spy networks. 
""Russia has shown itself as a strategic enemy, not a strategic partner,"" said another British official, who stressed however that Britain was not seeking new economic sanctions.
May will seek to demonstrate to EU governments that all Western countries are vulnerable to such attacks, as well as what NATO says is a Russian strategy to undermine the West, officials said.
She will need to overcome reluctance from the Russia doves in the EU since the bloc is traditionally split on how to deal with Moscow.
Ties between Moscow and the West plummeted over Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Kiev and support for rebels in east Ukraine, which have triggered sanctions by the EU.
French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday the Salisbury attack could not go without response.
Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. President Donald Trump have already said in a joint statement with May that they ""share"" Britain's assessment of Russian responsibility. 

Diplomats said EU leaders could settle for similar language, though some bloc members remained concerned there was not enough direct proof to incriminate Russia in the attack.

NATO, whose 60,000-strong force had kept peace in Bosnia after a U.S-brokered peace deal ended its conflict in 1995, took aerial shots of close to 50 locations where landmines or other explosive ordnance had been planted.
They are now in the possession of EUFOR, which took over its military peace mission in Bosnia in 2012.
""The snapshots will help to (provide) a better insight into the situation in the areas contaminated with landmines that have remained after the war,"" Bosnia's Civil Affairs Minister Adil Osmanovic said after signing a memorandum of understanding with NATO and EUFOR commanders in Bosnia. 
Bosnia plans to do a 2018-2019 assessment of the areas where landmines are still present, an EU-funded project that will serve as the basis for the country's new anti-landmine strategy.
Bosnia's Mine Action Centre (MAC) estimates that landmines are still present in about 1,000 square meters of the territory, the legacy of the war that killed 100,000 people and displaced more than a million.
MAC says that more than 600 people have been killed and more than 1,700 more have been wounded in landmine accidents since the war ended in 1995. In 2017 alone, three people were killed and four wounded in four such accidents.

657,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",Qatar puts 28 people and entities on new terrorism list,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar said on Thursday it had placed 28 people and entities on a terrorism list, including several Qatari nationals already blacklisted by rival Arab states who accuse Doha of supporting militants. 
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt imposed travel, diplomatic and trade sanctions on Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of financing terrorism, meddling in the affairs of Arab states and cozying up to their arch-rival Iran. 
Doha has called the charges ""baseless allegations"" and accuses the countries of seeking to curtail its sovereignty.
Adding to suspects identified in October, Doha's new list, published on the official website of its National Counter Terrorism Committee, included some individuals first named by its rivals, but stopped short of mentioning more mainstream Islamists whose regional influence they oppose.
The move appeared to bring Qatar's blacklist more in line with that of the Arab states, but the motivation for its publication remained unclear. A Qatari government spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The four Arab countries, which have called themselves the ""Anti-Terror Quartet"", maintain a list of 72 people and organizations they say have links to Doha.
Named on the new Qatari list were two Qatari citizens who were described by the boycotting countries as financiers of the Islamist militant Nusra Front group fighting in Syria. Their whereabouts are not clear.
Absent from the list was the Qatar-based International Union of Muslim Scholars, which was formed in 2004 mostly by clerics belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood and chaired by the Egyptian Sheikh Youssef al-Qaradawi. The group and Qaradawi are both blacklisted by Doha's rivals.
UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash posted on Twitter: ""Apart from its obstinacy, Qatar is confirming the evidence against it and that its support for extremism and terrorism is at the heart of its crisis."" 
Qatar had listed 13 alleged al Qaeda and Islamic State militants in October in a joint move with the United States and five other Gulf Arab states, including the boycotters.
The United States, which hosts a major air base in Qatar, has sought to resolve the diplomatic dispute. While President Donald Trump initially accused Qatar of funding terrorism in the past ""at a very high level"", he thanked its ruler for combating terrorism in a phone call in January.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Thursday there was an urgent need to find a political solution to Yemen's war, as he voiced hope for a U.N. special envoy's peace efforts and firmly backed Riyadh.
A Saudi-led coalition intervened in neighboring Yemen in 2015 against Iran-aligned Houthis, who had ousted the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The civil war has killed an estimated 10,000 people.
""We must also reinvigorate urgent efforts to seek a peaceful resolution to the civil war in Yemen and we support you in this regard,"" Mattis said.
Asked by reporters at the start of his talks whether he would raise the issue of civilian casualties in Yemen, Mattis said: ""We are going to end this war, that is the bottom line. And we are going to end it on positive terms for the people of Yemen but also security for the nations in the peninsula.""
Earlier this year, the United Nations chief appointed former British diplomat Martin Griffiths as his new envoy charged with trying to broker peace in Yemen.
Mattis praised Saudi Arabia for the ""significant amounts of humanitarian aid"" it had provided to civilians in Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition said earlier this year it would commit $1.5 billion in humanitarian aid for the country. 
The war in Yemen has displaced more than 2 million people and driven the country - already the poorest on the Arabian Peninsula - to the verge of widespread famine. Nearly 1 million people have been infected with cholera.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate killed a resolution seeking an end to U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's campaign in Yemen.
The Senate voted 55-44 to dismiss the resolution, which sought for the first time to take advantage of a provision in the 1973 War Powers Act that allows any senator to introduce a resolution on whether to withdraw U.S. armed forces from a conflict not authorized by Congress.
The vote was largely along party lines, although a handful of Democrats voted with the majority Republicans to kill the measure, and a handful of Republicans supported the failed effort to let it move ahead. 
During Senate debate before the vote, some backers called the three-year-long conflict in Yemen a “humanitarian catastrophe,” which they blamed on the Saudis.
The United States provides refueling and intelligence support to the Saudi-led coalition. 
Before the start of his meeting at the Pentagon, which was delayed by 30 minutes due to his late arrival, Prince Mohammed said the two countries were working together on combating a number of threats.
""Under the leadership of you, Mr. Secretary, the cooperation has improved tremendously between the two ministries of defense and we will continue doing so in the future,"" the crown prince said. He was speaking through a translator. 

President Donald Trump gave a warm welcome to the crown prince during a meeting at the White House earlier this week and credited U.S. defense sales to Saudis with boosting American jobs.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders will condemn what they see as Turkey's illegal actions in a standoff over eastern Mediterranean gas reserves with bloc members Greece and Cyprus, in a joint statement to be issued on Thursday. 
Athens and Nicosia have accused Ankara of violating international law in a row over offshore oil and gas exploration after several incidents at sea. 
The leaders' summit ""urgently calls on Turkey to cease these actions and respect the sovereign rights of Cyprus to explore and exploit its natural resources in accordance with... the law,"" according to a draft of the text seen by Reuters.
A vessel charted by Italy's state-controlled Eni was unable to reach an area Cyprus has licensed for drilling because of Turkish military maneuvers in a two-week standoff in February. 
Turkey says some areas of Cyprus's offshore maritime zone fall under the jurisdiction of Turkey or Turkish Cypriots, underscoring tensions in the broader eastern Mediterranean over competing claims for offshore resources. 
Cyprus and Turkey have not had diplomatic relations since a 1974 Turkish invasion of the island triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. Decades of reconciliation efforts have failed.
ERDOGAN TALKS
The EU has had to tread carefully with Turkey, which has the second-biggest NATO army and is instrumental in curbing immigration to Europe from the Middle East and Africa.
Despite stepping up criticism of what the EU sees as President Tayyip Erdogan's growing authoritarianism, the bloc's top officials will host him for talks on Monday in the Bulgarian city of Varna.
At that meeting, the bloc has said it will promise another 3 billion euros ($3.7 billion) to support Syrian refugees in Turkey. But it will also criticize Erdogan's military offensive in Syria, as well as his human rights record, which has already led the bloc to suspend Turkey's long-stalled EU accession bid.
The EU wants Turkey to reverse its sweeping security crackdown after a botched coup against Erdogan in 2016. Ankara says the measures are needed to combat multiple threats.
EU leaders will on Thursday also appeal for the release of European citizens - mostly Germans - being held in Turkish custody.

Singer Zuhal Olcay was accused of changing the lyrics of one of her songs by substituting Erdogan's name into it and making an insulting hand gesture while singing, Hurriyet said.
Video from the performance showed Olcay changing her song's lyrics to read ""Recep Tayyip Erdogan, it's all empty, it's all a lie, life will end one day and you'll say 'I had a dream',"" Hurriyet said.
In her testimony, Olcay rejected the accusations, saying she had used Erdogan's name because it fit the rhyme scheme and had no ""ulterior or insulting motive"". She said the hand gesture was aimed at an audience member.
Olcay was previously fined 10,620 lira ($2,708) for ""insulting a public servant"" in 2010, according to the state-run Anadolu agency.
Insulting the president is a crime punishable by up to four years in prison in Turkey.
Lawyers for Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for more than a decade, have filed more than 1,800 cases against people including cartoonists, a former Miss Turkey winner and school children on accusations of insulting him.
Enes Kanter, a Turkish basketball player in the U.S. NBA team New York Knicks, is also standing trial in absentia for insulting Erdogan.
Following the 2016 failed coup, Erdogan said he would drop outstanding suits, in a one-off gesture, but several new cases have since emerged.
Rights groups and some Western governments have voiced concern that Turkey is sliding toward authoritarianism, criticizing a crackdown which saw some 150,000 people sacked or suspended from their jobs and more than 50,000 jailed pending trial on suspicion of links to the failed coup.
The government says such measures are necessary to ensure stability and defend Turkey from multiple security threats.

664,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>",Powerful Afghan governor defying President Ghani agrees to go,"By Matin Sahak
MAZAR-I SHARIF, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Months of wrangling that have undermined the authority of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's Western-backed government ended on Thursday when the powerful governor of Balkh province agreed to step aside following a deal over his successor.
Atta Mohammad Noor, who has defied Ghani's attempts to remove him from office for months, said he would step aside, allowing Ishaq Rahgozar, a member of parliament, to move to the governor's palace in the provincial capital, Mazar-i Sharif.
""Now that our demands have been met, I have decided to step down,"" Atta Noor told a packed rally of supporters in the city, adding that he would stay in Mazar and remain active in politics.
Under the agreement, a new police chief in Balkh acceptable to Atta Noor was also confirmed on Thursday, while he was also expected to be allowed to name the new education minister in the national government as well as the ambassador to Kazakhstan.
The deal ends a damaging standoff that highlighted deep divisions in Ghani's government as well as his struggle to impose his authority on the powerful regional leaders who dominate Afghan politics outside the capital.
Balkh is one of the richest and most stable provinces in Afghanistan, sitting on lucrative trade crossings into neighboring Central Asian countries and with far less Taliban activity than adjacent provinces.
After Ghani's office announced last year that the president had accepted a previously signed resignation letter from the governor, Atta Noor refused to go, declaring that Ghani had reneged on the terms of an agreement between the two.
At his office in Mazar, he received a stream of delegations, defying what he called the ""weak, lazy and corrupt"" government in Kabul and building his profile ahead of presidential elections next year, in which he is likely to play a key role either as candidate or powerbroker.
His position was helped by the strong political support and personal wealth he has built in more than a decade as governor as well as a long career that started as a commander in the anti-Soviet Mujahideen.
As well as underlining government weakness, the standoff highlighted the ethnic divisions that over the past two years have come increasingly to the fore in Afghan politics.
Atta Noor is one of the leaders of Jamiat-i Islami, a party mainly supported by Persian-speaking ethnic Tajiks from northern Afghanistan, many of whom have been bitterly resentful of Ghani, a Pashtun, whom they accuse of favoring his own ethnic group.

However his relations with other Jamiat leaders, notably Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, have also been difficult, with the two seen as potential rivals to lead the party in the presidential election.

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine's State Security Service on Thursday detained lawmaker Nadiya Savchenko, an ex-military helicopter navigator who became a national hero after being held in a Russian jail, on charges of planning a military-style coup.
Prosecutors allege that Savchenko, who became a lawmaker on her return from Russia, planned an attack on parliament using grenades and automatic weapons acquired from pro-Russian separatists in the eastern conflict zone.
Savchenko, who has been a frequent and outspoken critic of the current authorities, does not deny the allegations against her outright. 
She says undercover agents seeking to discredit her had encouraged her to plan to overthrow the government and that she had played along to bring the authorities' schemes to public notice.
""This is not a terrorist act, this is a political provocation to make the authorities look ridiculous,"" she said at a briefing on Tuesday.
She was detained in parliament on Thursday after lawmakers voted to remove her parliamentary immunity from prosecution and granted General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko's request to allow her to be taken into custody.
""The plan was to overthrow the constitutional system by carrying out terrorist attacks on Kiev's central government quarter ... using weapons received from the leaders of the so-called DNR,"" Lutsenko told MPs, referring to the separatists.
The accusations mark a fall from grace for Savchenko, whose steely defiance while on trial in Russia, including hunger strikes and showing a judge the middle finger live on TV, earned her the nickname of Ukraine's ""Joan of Arc"".
She returned in May 2016 to great fanfare after a prisoner exchange with Russia, but quickly became a fiery and unpredictable opposition figure in parliament. 
""ANTI-HEROES"" 
Ahead of Thursday's vote, Lutsenko presented the prosecutors' case against Savchenko, including undercover video clips that appeared to show her trying to persuade members of the Ukrainian military to join a plot. 
With an aviator-style fleece-lined coat slung around her shoulders, Savchenko stood through the presentation arms-crossed, occasionally responding to the accusations with a derisive smile.
In a speech to lawmakers, she did not address the case against her directly, but accused the authorities of betraying the ideals of the 2013/2014 pro-European uprising.
If the status quo remains unchanged, ""then the danger in parliament won't be me, your danger will be your people"", she said.
""To accuse me of treason against Ukraine ... and to make anti-heroes out of yesterday's heroes simply because they do not agree with the policies and positions of the current government, that's all the authorities can do,"" she said.
Prosecutors say Savchenko's plot included working with prisoner exchange negotiator Volodymyr Ruban, who on March 9 was detained at a frontline checkpoint with a collection of weapons, including machine guns and explosives. [nL5N1QR3JE]
Ruban, who remains in detention, denies allegations he was planning an attack.
Savchenko was captured on the frontline in eastern Ukraine by pro-Russian separatists in 2014 and held in jail in Russia on murder charges that she said were fabricated. She became a symbol of resistance against Russia to many Ukrainians.

Since her return she has held talks with the separatists without the government's consent and published secret lists of people who were captured or are missing in the conflict.

The sanctions, which were announced on Wednesday, will require companies and government bodies to apply for special licenses to do business in the United States, an action designed to increase pressure on President Salva Kiir to end the conflict and humanitarian crisis in South Sudan.
""These measures are viewed by the Ministry of Petroleum as counterproductive to the shared mission of the Republic of South Sudan's and the United States' governments to bring peace and stability to South Sudan,"" the ministry said in a statement.
It pledged to work with the U.S. Department of Commerce ""to remove these restrictions and resume normal relations with the U.S."".
South Sudan has been torn by civil war since 2013 when fighting erupted between troops loyal to Kiir and those loyal to then-Vice President Riek Machar. The conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives, slashed oil production and driven about a third of the population of 12 million from their homes.
Earlier this month, activists accused the government of funneling cash from the state oil company to militias responsible for atrocities and attacks on civilians.
Announcing the sanctions, the U.S. State Department also said the government and corrupt officials were using oil revenue to buy weapons and fund militias.
Washington has already placed sanctions on South Sudanese military and political figures, and in January imposed an arms embargo to try to halt the flow of weapons into the country, signaling that it had lost patience with the warring factions for ignoring ceasefires. 
Last year, the government said it planned to more than double oil production to 290,000 barrels per day in fiscal 2017-2018.
South Sudan is the most oil-dependent country in the world, with oil accounting for almost all its exports and around 60 percent of its gross domestic product, according to the World Bank.
The government said on Thursday it will encourage more investments in the petroleum sector.
Petroleum minister Ezekiel Lol Gatkuoth extended an exploration and production sharing agreement with Petronas of Malaysia (PETR.UL) for six years.
The deal covers blocks 3 and 7 in Unity oilfield which have been shut down due to the conflict. The government said it had secured a commitment from Petronas to resume operations soon. 
""Bringing back production at Unity and other fields, and increasing production overall, are the priorities of this ministry,"" the minister said in a statement.

In December 2016 police detained the young Afghan man, who had arrived in the country at the height of the refugee crisis a year earlier. A test determined that his DNA matched that found near the site where a 19-year-old German female student had died in the southwestern city of Freiburg two months earlier.
A police autopsy found she had been a victim of sexual crime and violence before she drowned in a river.
In January, a government-sponsored study found that violent crime rose by about 10 percent in 2015 and 2016, and more than 90 percent of the rise was attributed to young male refugees, adding fuel to a political debate over the handling of the migrant crisis. 
Fears about security and the assimilation of migrants helped pave the way for the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) to win third place in an election last September, and it has now become the official opposition in parliament. 
The Afghan man, identified only as Hussein K. under reporting rules, was sentenced to life in prison and preventative detention thereafter, the court in Freiburg said, meaning he will never walk free in public.
He had been convicted of attempted murder in Greece in 2013 and sentenced to 10 years in jail, but he was released in 2015 on parole and fled to Germany.
The German court sentenced Hussein, who was allegedly 17 years-old when he committed the crime, as an adult, not as a minor, after it concluded with experts that he was an adult at the time of the offense.
""After an overall assessment of the personality of the defendant and the environmental conditions, the Chamber has come to the conclusion that his mental and moral development is no longer equal to a young person,"" the court said.
In January, a fatal stabbing of a 15-year-old German girl by a suspect identified by police as her former boyfriend, an Afghan migrant, fueled a debate about verifying the ages of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum in Germany.

Kuczynski, a 79-year-old former Wall Street banker who once held U.S. citizenship, has led Latin American criticism of President Nicolas Maduro's government over rights and democracy, even banning him from attending a summit in Lima next month. 
But he resigned on Wednesday in the face of near-certain impeachment over a graft investigation into his connections to Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company that has acknowledged bribing officials across Latin America.
""These fireworks are because someone is going! Goodbye PPK, farewell PPK!"" boomed Cabello to a cheering crowd, using an acronym for Kuczynski's full name, as fireworks went off overhead during a rally late on Wednesday.
""Here are some fireworks to remind the world - if you mess with Venezuela, you're out!"" he added in the event broadcast on his weekly TV show 'Bashing with the Sledgehammer.'
Supporters chanted: ""He's gone, he's gone!""
Despite Kuczynski's fall, Maduro still faces strong opposition from most major nations around Latin America.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which has dubbed the scheme ""Modicare"", announced in February the program would provide 100 million families, or about 500 million poor people, with health cover of 500,000 rupees per year for treatment of serious ailments.
The federal budget had made an allocation of 20 billion rupees for the scheme for 2018-19, but officials had said more funds would be made available as the program was rolled out.
Health Ministry officials said the government has allocated 100 billion rupees ($1.54 billion) for the ""National Health Protection Mission"" for 2018/19 and 2019/20.
""It's a historic step and a bold decision. It will be the largest public funded health protection scheme in the world,"" Health Minister J.P. Nadda said at a news briefing. 
The measures are Modi's latest attempt to reform a public health system that faces a shortage of hospitals and doctors. The government has also in recent years capped prices of critical drugs and medical devices and increased health funding.
Still, India spends only about 1 percent of its GDP on public health, among the world's lowest, and the health ministry estimates such funding leads to ""catastrophic"" expenses that push 7 percent of the population into poverty each year.
""This will give underprivileged families the financial support required when faced with illnesses requiring hospitalization,"" Nadda said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The second anniversary of a militant attack in Belgium in which 32 people died brings back painful memories for Walter Benjamin, whose right leg was partially amputated because he was caught in a bomb blast at the airport. 
The government said last year it would grant survivors victim status, making them eligible for a pension and reimbursement for medical costs but Benjamin said Belgium has done too little to help survivors return to their daily lives.
""It's the government's responsibility to protect its own citizens,"" said Benjamin, who wrote a book to help him cope. ""People have been abandoned.""
Soldiers have patrolled Brussels since three young Belgian Muslims blew themselves up with suitcase bombs at the Maelbeek metro station and Zaventem airport on March 22, 2016.
But Benjamin and other victims say they still have security concerns as they deal with the memory of the attacks.
Philippe Vansteenkiste's sister was killed in the attack and he now runs a group for victims. He said there were around 500 direct and indirect victims and more were coming forward.
""People walked away thinking 'I was lucky, I escaped,' but then PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) starts,"" Vansteenkiste said.
Benjamin was on his way to visit his 16-year-old daughter in Israel when the airport bombs went off. In the aftermath, he said a Muslim man came to his aid. He recalled the moment to argue that not all Muslims should be blamed for the attacks.

Since then, Benjamin finds himself hurrying through airport terminals and security checks. Talking to other survivors and fellow amputees, he says, has helped him heal.

LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Europe's second-highest court sided with proponents of more transparency in the EU lawmaking process on Thursday, saying that European Parliament should provide key documents in talks between legislators and EU countries on demand.
""The European Parliament must in principle grant access, on specific request, to documents relating to ongoing trilogues. The work of the trilogues constitutes a decisive stage in the legislative process,"" the General Court said.
Trilogues are informal meetings between the Parliament, the European Commission which is the EU executive, and the European Council which is made up of the leaders of the 28 EU countries.
Such closed-door negotiations play a key role on critical and sensitive issues. Hundreds of trilogues take place every year and are used in 70 to 80 percent of the legislative process. Supporters say it speeds up the process for complex laws.
Critics, however, say this type of lawmaking, shrouded in secrecy, limits democratic oversight as there is no transparency and it ultimately erodes trust in EU institutions and fuels euroskepticism.
Judges said more openness would boost EU bodies in the eyes of 500 million Europeans.
""It is in fact rather a lack of information and debate which is capable of giving rise to doubts in the minds of citizens, not only as regards the lawfulness of an isolated act, but also as regards the legitimacy of the decision-making process as a whole,"" they said. 
The ruling is a welcome boost for European democracy, said Sophie in 't Veld from the liberal ALDE group at Parliament, the fourth-largest at the assembly, who said she had similar experiences getting access to key documents.
""Commission and Council should draw the lessons from this ruling and submit a comprehensive action plan for real transparency as soon as possible, in any case ahead of the European elections,"" she said, referring to May 2019 polls.
The General Court's ruling came after Emilio De Capitani, the former secretary of the European Parliament civil liberties committee and executive director of the Fundamental Rights European Experts Group, sued the lawmaking assembly in 2015 over access to trilogue documents concerning freedom, security and personal data protection.
The papers typically lay out the Commission's legislative proposal, the Parliament's position and its amendments, the Council's views and the provisional compromise or the Council's preliminary position based on lawmakers' proposed changes.
Parliament granted him partial access, saying that there was no overriding public interest which outweighed the public interest in favor of disclosure.
De Capitani however continued his lawsuit because of the possibility of such incidents happening again - resulting in the ruling on Thursday.

Parliament can appeal the judgment to the Court of Justice of the EU on points of law.

(Reuters) - A majority of Americans, including Republicans, Democrats and gun owners want stricter laws on gun ownership and armed guards in schools, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national poll taken in early March.
Hundreds of thousands of students and their families are expected to march in cities across the United States on Saturday to demand stricter gun control, part of the response to a mass shooting at a Florida high school in February.
The following are some of the main findings of the poll:
GUNS IN SCHOOLS
About 75 percent of adults say they want armed security guards in school, with some 53 percent in favor of publicly funding gun classes for teachers and school personnel and 45 percent saying school staff should be encouraged to carry a weapon. 
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR GUN CONTROL
A majority of Democrats and Republican voters support stricter gun laws, including 91 percent on both sides who say anyone with a history of mental illness should be banned from owning a gun. Eighty-four percent of Republicans believe people on the ""no-fly"" list should also be banned from gun ownership and 83 percent are in favor of expanding background checks. A majority of Republicans also say that assault weapons and high capacity ammunition clips should be outlawed. 
GRAPHIC: http://reut.rs/2ptFPhy
GUN OWNERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO VOTE 
Gun owners are more politically active than others, the poll found. They are more likely to be registered to vote, and they express more interest in voting in November's midterm elections, when one third of U.S. Senate seats and all the seats in the U.S. House of Representatives will be decided.
Fifty percent of gun owners said they are certain to vote compared to 41 percent of people who do not own a gun. 
GUN CONTROL IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE ECONOMY 
Gun control is on a par with the economy as a top issue that will motivate U.S. voters in November, the poll found. 
GUN OWNERS STILL APPROVE OF THE NRA
One in four adults say they own a gun and a majority of gun owners say they own more than one gun. 
Nearly 60 percent of gun owners say that the National Rifle Association gun rights advocacy group is either doing ""the right amount of work"" or it ""doesn't do enough"" to promote the interests of gun owners. About 30 percent say the NRA is ""too aggressive"" in promoting gun rights, according to the poll. 
Separately, about 38 percent of gun owners also say they would like to vote in November for a congressional candidate who would oppose U.S. President Donald Trump and 39 percent say the country is on the wrong track.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll of 2,389 U.S. adults was conducted between March 5-7 and has an overall credibility interval of 4-5 percent.

Though supporting the need to combat violence against women, opponents object to the treaty's definition of gender which they say paves the way for introducing transsexual or transgender as separate categories, which they oppose. 
Arguing the case for ratification, Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic told a cabinet session that it would strengthen ""the legal, institutional and financial framework for combating violence against women and within families.""
Some conservative groups plan to stage a protest against ratification in the capital Zagreb at the weekend and say they will push for a referendum on the issue.
To appease opponents, the government has adopted a separate statement on the ratification saying that the Council of Europe's convention will not bring a change to Croatia's legal definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman.
Some top members of the leading party in the ruling coalition, the conservative HDZ, also voiced discontent with the planned ratification. It is still not clear when the parliament will vote on the issue.

Last month the same treaty was rejected in two other eastern EU members, Bulgaria and Slovakia, for similar objections about the definition of gender as ""social roles, behaviors, activities and characteristics that a society considers appropriate for women and men""

677,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 06:33AM ET</span>",Meditation and law: The Suu Kyi loyalist tipped for Myanmar presidency,"By Thu Thu Aung
YANGON (Reuters) - Win Myint, the long-serving member of Myanmar's ruling party who is expected to become the country's next president within days, is described by colleagues as a skilled political operator with a crucial quality - loyalty to de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
The job is vacant after another Suu Kyi loyalist, Htin Kyaw, resigned due to ill-health on Wednesday.
Suu Kyi - who remains a national heroine in Myanmar despite growing international criticism over the Rohingya crisis in the northwest - is barred by the military-drafted constitution from assuming the top job because her sons have British citizenship.
Still, she wields absolute authority in the ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) after vowing on the eve of her 2015 election victory to run the country from ""above the president"" - an arrangement that means the change is unlikely to distort the balance of power in a country where the army remains powerful.
State media confirmed on Thursday the 66-year-old Win Myint was poised to take over when the country's parliament elects a new president, in a vote that must be held within seven days, after he resigned as lower house speaker on Wednesday. 
""U Win Myint, 66, is considered to be one of the candidates for the presidency, which was vacated by U Htin Kyaw for health reasons,"" said the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar daily. 
Suu Kyi is known for keeping her cards close to her chest and operating with a very narrow group of trusted advisors. Win Myint, who has been an NLD member from its humble beginnings almost three decades ago, is among the few to whom she has given serious responsibility since taking office almost two years ago.
""If I have to describe him in one word, I would say: 'a good person, and loyal to Aung San Suu Kyi',"" said Ye Htut, an upper house NLD lawmaker.
Ye Htut said that when he was invited to Win Myint's daughter's wedding last year, he specifically asked guests not to bring any gifts to the ceremony. ""It's obvious he's an honest man who's not seeking anything for his own benefit.""
Win Myint comes from Myanmar's southern agricultural heartland in the Ayeyarwady delta region. He worked as a senior lawyer in the 1980s and took part in the 1988 pro-democracy uprising, later serving three years in an internment camp.
""He usually takes walks in early mornings and does mediation to improve his health and practice mindfulness,"" said Cho Cho Win, a lower house NLD lawmaker.
CRITICS STIFLED
Win Myint's critics, including some Yangon-based diplomats, say that while he is loyal and honest, the quality of debate during his tenure as speaker deteriorated as he silenced dissenting voices - including those from the NLD. 
Nyo Nyo Thin, a former Yangon region lawmaker, has criticized Win Myint's performance as the speaker, saying parliament, where the NLD enjoys a comfortable majority, was not robust enough in performing its check-and-balance role.
""Parliament has responsibilities to control and watch over the government's activities for its actions and policies, but there is no remarkable activity in the parliament when he was in charge,"" said Nyo Nyo Thin.
Reuters was unable to reach Win Myint for comment on the criticism.
The president-to-be was among a few dozen NLD members, including Suu Kyi, elected to parliament in 2012 by-elections as the country began a dramatic transition from nearly 50 years of military rule.
Before his appointment as lower house speaker in April 2016, he shared an austere one-room chamber with his wife in a compound for lawmakers in Myanmar's purpose-built capital Naypyitaw, living next to other leading NLD figures.
""He is very conscious, self-aware and very clever. He takes time to do things in a steady way. He could remember and recite laws without reading because he studied the law in-depth,"" said a long-time NLD friend and a senior party member Han Tha Myint.
According to the country's constitution, the more senior of two vice presidents will stand in as president until a new leader is elected by parliament.

On Thursday, parliament elected a new lower house speaker and laid the ground for a presidential vote expected on Friday or Monday.

680,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 10:21AM ET</span>",Suspect in Palestinian assassination attempt among four dead in Gaza shootout: Hamas,"By Nidal al-Mughrabi
GAZA (Reuters) - Hamas said its security forces in Gaza shot dead on Thursday the main suspect behind an attempt to assassinate the Palestinian prime minister, a bombing that threatens to unravel its reconciliation agreement with the West Bank-based government.
Two members of the Hamas security forces and one accomplice of the suspect also died in the shootout, the Hamas-led Gaza interior ministry said.
The bombing of Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah's convoy in Gaza last week dealt another blow to efforts to implement a unity deal between the two main Palestinian factions - Islamist Hamas, which dominates Gaza, and Fatah, the main party in the Palestinian Authority in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
The motorcade Hamdallah and Palestinian security chief Majid Faraj was attacked on March 13 shortly after it entered Gaza from neighboring Israel. They were uninjured.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had blamed Hamas for the explosion.
After Thursday's raid, a spokesman for Hamdallah's government questioned Hamas's version of events and again accused the group of bearing ""full criminal responsibility"" for the assassination attempt.
""Once more, Hamas is going along the same path of ... fabricating weak stories that make no sense,"" the spokesman, Youssef Al-Mahmoud, said.
More than a decade after Hamas fighters drove the Palestinian Authority out of Gaza, Egypt has been brokering a reconciliation deal under which the PA would again assume administrative and security control in the territory of two million people.
Hamdallah has been spearheading those efforts on behalf of the PA, with both sides still divided over how to share power in Gaza, where Hamas is still the strongest armed force.
Abbas has argued that the assassination attempt proved that the agreement was failing and that Hamas could not be trusted.
In a statement, the Hamas-run Interior Ministry in Gaza said its security forces investigating the assassination attempt had surrounded a hideout in the central region of the enclave and came under fire after demanding the suspects surrender.
It said a man named Anas Abu Khoussa, whom it identified as the prime suspect in the bombing, was killed in the ensuing shootout, along with an accomplice and two Hamas security men.
The ministry did not say whether Abu Khoussa was affiliated with any militant group.
Abbas has offered no evidence of the involvement of Hamas in the attempt against Hamdallah's life. But he said he did not trust Hamas to investigate the incident honestly and that there had been ""zero"" progress in the reconciliation.
Hamas seized the Gaza Strip from forces loyal to Fatah in 2007.

The Palestinian reconciliation effort is opposed by Israel, which considers Hamas, a group dedicated to its destruction, an implacable foe. U.S.-brokered peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians collapsed in 2014, in part over a unity deal that year between the PA and Hamas, as well as other issues.

During often bitter campaigning during the June 2016 referendum on whether to leave the EU, which Britain joined in 1973, some Brexit supporters called for a return of the blue passports, issued from 1920 to 1988. 
The current burgundy document is made by British firm De La Rue in northern England.

Yang was China's top diplomat when he was State Councillor and is now a member of the ruling Communist Party's 25-member Politburo. He will visit on Friday and Saturday as a special representative of President Xi Jinping, ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily news briefing.
Yang, a fluent English speaker and former Chinese ambassador to the United States, currently has only a party and not government position.
There has been speculation in diplomatic circles about what he will do following the reshuffle, though the foreign ministry has said he will continue to play an important diplomatic role.
Yang will meet South African government and political party leaders to discuss plans for a summit later this year between China and African countries, as well as bilateral ties, Hua added.
Yang was appointed to the Politburo, the second-largest of the party's three elite ruling bodies, in October after a party congress.
Yang, 67, remains secretary general of the Foreign Affairs Leading Group chaired by Xi, which is a top party body that directs and coordinates Chinese diplomacy, although the body is due to be re-named and the party has not said who will be on it.
The party is ultimately responsible for all government decisions and it is where real power lies. 
Yang's successor as state councilor, Wang Yi, is not a Politburo member but is on the Central Committee, the largest of the party's decision-making bodies and a rung below the Politburo.

Wang's new position was announced on Tuesday as part of a broader government reshuffle. Wang also remains foreign minister.

685,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 10:21AM ET</span>","Assad closer to Ghouta victory, as some rebels prepare to quit","BEIRUT/DAMASCUS (Reuters) - The Syrian government moved closer to ending rebel resistance in eastern Ghouta as civilians streamed out of one of its besieged, bomb-battered towns on Thursday and insurgents prepared to surrender another. 
The army assault on eastern Ghouta, an area of towns and farmland just outside Damascus, has been one of the most intense in Syria's seven-year-old war, killing more than 1,500 people in a relentless bombardment with war planes, shells and rockets. 
A Reuters witness said buses had driven into the town of Harasta and a Syrian military source said 600 to 700 fighters were expected to be among about 2,000 people leaving in them in the coming hours for opposition areas in northwestern Syria. 
Hundreds of people including scores of fighters had already started boarding buses at an assembly point inside Harasta, the military source said. Between 18,000-20,000 people were expected to stay in Harasta under government rule, the source added. 
Meanwhile, state television reported that more than 6,000 people had fled the larger rebel-held town of Douma since Wednesday, crossing over into government-held territory.
The Ahrar al-Sham group's decision to surrender Harsata leaves only Douma and another rebel pocket in eastern Ghouta that includes the towns of Jobar, Ein Terma, Arbin and Zamalka. 
They are all that remain of the main insurgent stronghold near the Syrian capital Damascus, the biggest prize for President Bashar al-Assad in his fight against the rebels since the recapture of Aleppo in late 2016. 
Rebels fired rockets from eastern Ghouta into Damascus on Thursday, killing two people, state media reported. Television showed burning projectile parts on streets and in parks. 
Government air strikes had pummeled parts of eastern Ghouta on Thursday morning, striking Arbin and Zamalka and killing 19 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitoring group. 
An army officer interviewed on state television urged rebels who had not yet negotiated a deal to quit. ""Death is coming for you if you do not surrender,"" he said. 
On Sunday, Assad drove himself to a newly captured battlefront in eastern Ghouta, a demonstration of his seemingly unassailable position in the war that has been going his way since Russia sent its air force to help him in 2015.
The deal to surrender Harasta is the first by eastern Ghouta rebels and began on Thursday with a prisoner swap. In an interview with state television, a Syrian soldier freed by rebels wept and thanked God and the army for his release.
The Reuters witness at the crossing with Harasta said the army had removed barriers from the old frontline lying across the road into the town to allow the buses to pass. 
The Russian Defence Ministry website showed what it said was live footage from the al-Wafideen crossing point from Douma into government areas. Over a period of several minutes, it showed dozens of people in small groups coming around a corner and trekking along the dirt road past armed soldiers. 
Some bore bundles of their possessions, others carried small children or pushed prams. Behind were fields and trees. At one point in the road a man could be seen in a red shirt with the logo of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent. 
Douma is the most populous area in eastern Ghouta, and for more than a week it has been entirely surrounded by the government. The Jaish al-Islam rebel group that holds the town has said it is determined to fight on after a month-long government offensive that has taken 70 percent of the former opposition enclave in eastern Ghouta. 
However, the Observatory said people leaving the area were doing so under an agreement between the group and the government's closest ally Russia. 
FEROCITY
The Syrian government and Russia have both accused rebels in eastern Ghouta of stopping civilians leaving the area. They say their assault, which the Observatory says has killed more than 1,500 people so far, is needed to end Islamist militant rule over the area's people. 
They also say it is needed to end rebel shelling of Damascus and other nearby areas. On Tuesday, a rocket struck a marketplace in a government-held town, killing dozens. 
However, the ferocity of the Syrian army's offensive in eastern Ghouta has prompted Western condemnation and urgent pleas from United Nations humanitarian agencies for a ceasefire. 
Over the past week, tens of thousands of people have fled across the frontlines into government territory.
For the Harasta rebels, the journey to Idlib is one already well trodden by insurgents from other areas surrendered to Assad after prolonged sieges and intense bombardments of the kind used against eastern Ghouta over the past month. 
The northwestern province is the biggest remaining area under rebel control in Syria and its population has been doubled by refugees fleeing other areas including many opposition supporters. 
A military media unit run by Assad's ally Hezbollah on Wednesday said some 1,500 fighters along with 6,000 family members would depart Harasta under the agreement with the government. 

On Thursday the same Hezbollah media unit said the army and Ahrar al-Sham had started to exchange prisoners as the Harasta deal got under way.

Copies of the planned redelineation exercise were handed to members of parliament on Thursday.
The Southeast Asian country is gearing up for national elections that have to be called by August, with sources telling Reuters that polls may be held as early as April. Najib's coalition is widely expected to retain power.
The motion to redraw electoral boundaries will likely be approved by parliament, as it only requires a simple majority vote. Najib's Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition currently holds 132 out of the 222 seats in parliament.
The redelineation exercise had been delayed for months due to legal challenges and objections by the opposition, which has said repeatedly that it would carve out constituencies along racial lines and benefit Najib's ruling pact.
The government denies the accusation.
Electoral boundaries were last changed in 2003, under the leadership of then-premier Mahathir Mohamad, who was also accused of manipulating the process in favor of the ruling coalition, which has held power since independence from Britain in 1957.
Mahathir, 92, who led Malaysia for 22 years, is now running as the opposition's candidate for prime minister against Najib, his former protege.

Intense rains of up to an inch (3 cm) per hour was forecast on Thursday morning for Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, northwest of Los Angeles, where 25,000 people have evacuated in recent days, weather and local officials said.
""The storm has a lot of intensity behind it and has the potential to be life-threatening,"" said Amber Anderson, a spokeswoman for the Santa Barbara Fire Department. ""The public, for the most part, has heeded the warnings for evacuations.""
Wildfires last winter left California's coastline vulnerable to mudslides, by burning grass and shrubs that hold soil in place and baking a layer of earth that keeps rainwater from sinking deeply.
Some 21 people were killed and dozens injured in mudslides on Jan. 9 after rain in and around the Santa Barbara County community of Montecito, 85 miles (137 km) northwest of Los Angeles.
The current storm began producing downpours on Tuesday night and continued on Wednesday. County officials said this storm is expected to produce far more rainfall than January's.
As California prepared for rain, the East Coast was digging out from the fourth major snowstorm this month, which closed schools, grounded flights and halted bus and train service across the region. Two people died in separate traffic crashes, local media reported.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Islamist insurgents arrived in the northeastern Nigerian town of Rann on March 1. Ignoring the camp for 55,000 people displaced by the region's conflict, they stormed the nearby military base.
Inside, the gunmen executed eight security personnel and three aid staff working for the United Nations, according to security sources and photos seen by Reuters.
It was the first publicly-acknowledged killing of aid staff by Boko Haram insurgents, but for humanitarians struggling to reach millions of people in need of aid it was a realization of a long-held fear and another setback for a crisis response that has been criticized for being too slow.
Given the precarious situation in the region bordering Cameroon, Chad and Niger, the aid workers in many areas use military escorts and stay on or by bases.
For years, some aid workers had objected to such practices, saying they undermined humanitarian principles of neutrality and impartiality and put staff at risk.
""We are caught in a situation where humanitarian aid is part of a larger security and political agenda and that challenges the delivery of aid according to humanitarian principles,"" said Hugues Robert, program manager for Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in Nigeria.
Zainab Ahmed, the Nigerian minister of state for budget and national planning who is responsible for coordinating the government relief efforts, did not respond to a request for comment about the attack on Rann.
The United Nations, which describes the situation as one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, said in February that 7.7 million people in the three most affected states depended on aid for survival.
Since Boko Haram first launched attacks in 2009, more than 20,000 people have been killed, over 4,000 abducted and 1.6 million were still displaced in Nigeria at the end of 2017, according to the United Nations. (http://tmsnrt.rs/2CsEQGH)
WAR CRIME
While attacks on aid workers constitute a war crime, the perceived politicization and militarization of aid in countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Syria has led to a growing number of attacks on humanitarian staff in war zones.
In Nigeria, even though the army launched an offensive against Boko Haram in 2015 with the help of forces from Cameroon, Chad and Niger, much of the northeast outside cities such as Borno state capital Maiduguri remains a no-go zone. (http://tmsnrt.rs/2DjT88r)
""International humanitarian law is designed to prevent incidents like the Rann attack. By militarizing humanitarian sites - yet failing to protect them - the Nigerian military is putting vulnerable civilians in harm's way,"" said Matthew Page, an associate fellow with Chatham House's Africa Programme.
""Worried that the Nigerian government could obstruct their work, international entities have turned a blind eye to the militarization of internally displaced persons' camps and official corruption in the humanitarian space that puts civilians at even greater risk,"" he said.
The Nigerian military did not respond to request for comment.
In the wake of the Rann attack, some humanitarian groups are pushing for a reassessment of relations with the military, particularly the U.N.'s, according to people familiar with the discussions this month.
""There were definitely questions being asked,"" said Patricia McIlreavy, vice president at InterAction, an alliance of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) around the world.
""There was a feeling, from some NGOs that I spoke with but also some U.N. actors, that we kind of just went along with what the government was proposing,"" said McIlreavy, one of the authors of a U.N. report about the crisis response.
Asked whether working in close proximity with the military put aid staff at risk, a U.N. spokeswoman said the international community in Nigeria upheld the humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, independence and humanity. 
""In the context of northeast Nigeria, military escorts are used as a last resort, in areas where security risks are very high,"" she said.
SLOW RESPONSE
Aid agencies have now pulled out of Rann, leaving tens of thousands uprooted by the fighting living again in parlous conditions with little or no international humanitarian support.
Problems with the response to the crisis, including how closely humanitarians were working with the military, had been identified long before the attack.
As early as 2013, there were warnings of a food crisis in the region, from the U.S.-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) and others. In 2015, the United Nations and other NGOs said more than 50,000 people faced famine.
    Yet, for many, the crisis response only really began in June 2016 after MSF visited Bama town and discovered 24,000 people, including 4,500 children under five, living in catastrophic conditions which the agency said were ""beyond critical"".
Near the camp MSF found a field of evenly-spaced indentations in the earth, marked only by the occasional scrap of metal: 1,233 graves, 480 for children.
When MSF's news of Bama spread, Nigeria declared a ""nutrition emergency"" in Borno state and U.N. agencies started to ramp up the humanitarian response.
Disputes within the United Nations and aid groups, tense relations with the government and a slow response both internationally and by Nigerian politicians over the preceding years had all helped make a desperate situation catastrophic, said aid workers, diplomats, politicians and security personnel. 
""We all recognize that the international response here was in general very slow at the beginning,"" said Peter Lundberg, who was head of the U.N.'s response in the northeast until December.
Many of the people involved with the crisis response interviewed by Reuters said Nigeria had been reluctant to accept food aid over concern it would harm the image of the country, the biggest economy in Africa. They also said some international groups held back from speaking out about the crisis for fear it would damage their relations with Abuja.
""To be fair to the international community, I think that there was also from the government side a reluctance to perhaps fully acknowledge not only that it was a conflict but it was actually turning into a humanitarian crisis. And unfortunately that's not uncommon,"" Lundberg told Reuters in November.
In 2016, MSF said it had been raising the alarm with U.N. agencies for two years but they had failed to respond.
A spokesman for WFP said it could only operate in a country at the request of the government and in Nigeria that didn't happen until March 2016.
He said WFP's response was one of its ""most significant and swift expansions ever"", adding that it planned to deliver aid to 1.5 million people a month by June, from 1 million now.
'TOXIC NARRATIVE'
Despite a massive increase in budgets and humanitarian staff working in the region over the past two years, the response was still wracked with problems holding back aid as recently as June, according to an internal U.N. report seen by Reuters.
It described a ""toxic narrative"" between the Nigerian government and the humanitarian community, an ""us and them"" divide between the United Nations and other NGOs and a relief effort that failed to adhere to international humanitarian law.
The report also warned that the Nigerian government had failed to grasp the reality of the situation on the ground.
""Arguably the most critical factor in scaling up in a manner commensurate to the massive needs, is to orient the attention of the government of Nigeria to commit more of their own resources to humanitarian and recovery efforts in the northeast,"" it said.
A U.N. spokeswoman said the assessment was ""quite dated"" and a task force including representatives from the United Nations, international NGOs and donor countries was expected to issue an internal report on progress this month.
Even at the start of 2018, issues described in the report still threatened to undermine the response.
In a Jan. 2 letter to the government seen by Reuters, Edward Kallon, the U.N.'s top humanitarian official in Nigeria, said tensions with the government were delaying a fund-raising appeal.
While the disagreements were resolved in time for the February launch of the 2018 humanitarian response plan, letters sent by both sides highlight a fraught relationship.
""Time is not on our side,"" Kallon wrote to Ahmed.
In a Jan. 5 reply, also seen by Reuters, Ahmed said Kallon had been ""extremely disrespectful ... we are concerned that this situation is becoming untenable and therefore unacceptable to us."" 

The U.N. and Ahmed did not respond to requests for comment on the letters.

Nearly 200 people living on the slopes of Mount Ijen in East Java province were forced to evacuate.
""Because of this incident, the public - tourists or miners - are not allowed near the crater until further notice,"" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the national disaster mitigation agency. 
He added that many residents had experienced vomiting and difficulty in breathing. 
There was no increase in seismic activity, Nugroho said. 
The crater is a popular site for tourists and miners, who dig up hardening yellow sulfur to sell for use in everything from cosmetics to matchsticks. 
The volcano regularly puffs out small amounts of noxious gases but the site stays open to the public.

Around five million of Indonesia's 250 million people live and work near volcanoes, according to authorities, largely because of the fertile farming soil.

692,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 04:38AM ET</span>","Sarkozy denies wrongdoing, says Libya lies make his life 'hell': paper","By Brian Love and Emmanuel Jarry
PARIS (Reuters) - Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy told magistrates that accusations of illicit Libyan funding for his 2007 election campaign were a web of lies that had made his life ""hell"" and lost him a re-election bid in 2012, Le Figaro newspaper said.
The 63-year-old, who held power from 2007 to 2012, was told by investigators after two days of questioning in police custody on Wednesday he was formally suspected of passive corruption, an offense that carries a sentence of up to 10 years in jail. 
At issue is a murky affair of Libyan spies, arms dealers and allegations that late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi provided Sarkozy's 2007 election campaign with millions of euros shipped to Paris in suitcases - allegations Sarkozy has always denied.
The newspaper published a lengthy account of what it said was a verbatim declaration by Sarkozy.
""This calumny has made my life a living hell since March 11, 2011,"" he states, according to the newspaper.
""I've paid a heavy price for this affair. Put it this way: I lost the presidential election of 2012 by 1.5 percentage points. The controversy initiated by Gaddafi and his henchmen cost me that 1.5 percent"".
Sarkozy, who came under fire for giving Gaddafi a red-carpet reception in Paris in late 2007, said his problems began in March 2011 after he hosted Libyan rebels and went on to become one of the main advocates of a NATO-led campaign that resulted in the dictator's overthrow and killing by rebels in 2011.
He also denounced what he described as lies from one of his main accusers, a Franco-Lebanese businessman who has described himself among other things as a ""middleman in the shadows"" on liaison between Paris and Libyan secret service chiefs.
ACCUSATIONS
The accusations prompted the opening of a judicial inquiry in 2013 which snowballed this week when Sarkozy was called in for interrogation and, on Wednesday evening, formally placed under investigation as a suspect in the affair.
In France, being ""placed under investigation"" is a step that judicial investigators can take if they have serious grounds for suspecting an offense. It often but not always leads to trial.
Sarkozy, who was called ""president bling bling"" by many due to his flashy style, has been dogged for years by accusations of wrongdoing. He is challenging an order to stand trial on charges of illicit spending overruns during his failed 2012 campaign.
One of the many factors that played in 40-year-old Emmanuel Macron's presidential election win in May 2017 was a promise of a clean break with traditional French politics, often marred by accusations of corruption.

Sarkozy's immediate predecessor, Jacques Chirac, was tried and convicted in 2011 of misusing public funds to keep political friends in phantom jobs - making him the first French head of state to be convicted of a crime since Nazi collaborator Marshall Philippe Petain in 1945.

693,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 02:31AM ET</span>","Forty-five countries urge Cambodia to conduct free vote, release opposition leader","PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Forty-five countries called on Cambodia on Wednesday to reinstate the main opposition party, release its jailed leader and ensure a July general election is free and fair.
A statement on the human rights situation in Cambodia read by New Zealand on behalf of a group of 45 countries, including the United States, Germany, Australia and United Kingdom, said previous optimism had been ""replaced by deep concern"" regarding a decline in civil and political rights in Cambodia.
The statement, which was read to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, urged Cambodia's government to reinstate the opposition Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP) and all elected members. 
Dozens of opposition lawmakers were banned when Cambodia's Supreme Court dissolved the CNRP last year in a ruling that was widely condemned by the international community.
That decision followed the arrest of CNRP leader Kem Sokha last September. Kem Sokha has been charged with treason, accused of colluding with Americans to overthrow the Cambodian government. He denies the charges and the U.S. embassy in Phnom Penh has also denied the accusation.
Kem Sokha faces 30 years in prison if convicted.
Prime Minister Hun Sen has ruled Cambodia for 33 years.
He is a former Khmer Rouge cadre who defected from the genocidal group and helped drive it from power in 1979, and is credited with helping Cambodia achieve economic growth, but has been criticized for his crackdown on critics and the media.
""We call on the Royal Government of Cambodia to take all measures necessary, before it is too late, to ensure that the 2018 elections are free, fair and credible,"" the statement said.
""We are particularly concerned about the conditions under which opposition leader Kem Sokha is being detained following his arbitrary arrest: he is reportedly in isolation, without adequate access to health care, subjected to intrusive observation, and other conditions, such as constant light.""
""We call for the immediate release of all political prisoners, including Kem Sokha.""
The group raised concerns about a government crackdown on freedom of expression that has extended to independent media and non-governmental organizations.
Government spokesman Phay Siphan said Cambodia won't comply with demands made by foreign countries.
""We are equally members of the United Nations,"" Phay Siphan told Reuters. ""This is a violation of Cambodia's sovereignty.""
""We will hold elections according to what Cambodians want, based on Cambodian laws,"" he added.

694,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 02:30AM ET</span>",Philippine police say 13 killed in one day of drug busts,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine police killed 13 suspected drug dealers and arrested more than 100 people in dozens of anti-narcotics operations on Wednesday in a province north of the capital, its police chief said.
More than 4,000 Filipinos have been killed by police during President Rodrigo Duterte’s controversial 20-month-old war on drugs, and thousands more by unidentified armed men. Most killings have been in rundown areas of Metro Manila and the nearby provinces of Bulacan and Cavite.
Human rights groups and Duterte’s political opponents say executions of drug users and small-time peddlers are widespread, but police insist those killed were all dealers who put up violent resistance.
Police in Bulacan ran about 60 drugs ""buy-bust"", or sting, operations in nine towns, the police chief said on Thursday. 
Bulacan is where 32 people were killed in a single day in August last year. Last month, an additional 10 drug suspects died in a bloody night of drug busts.
""These operations are part of our stepped-up campaign against drugs and all other forms of criminality in the province,"" Bulacan police chief Romeo Caramat said in a statement.
""Unfortunately, 13 of the suspects were killed when our officers fired in self-defense shortly after the suspects who were armed with concealed guns sensed they were being entrapped and started firing.""
More than 100 people were also arrested and 19 firearms and about 250 packets of suspected drugs were seized during the 24-hour operations, Caramat said.
Last month, a prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague opened a preliminary examination into a complaint accusing Duterte and at least 11 officials of crimes against humanity.
The Philippines last week notified the United Nations of its decision to withdraw from the ICC because of what Duterte called outrageous attacks by U.N. officials and violations of due process.

Prosecutors want to ensure Kuczynski is in Peru while they investigate payments his consulting firm received from Brazilian builder Odebrecht while he held senior government posts more than a decade ago, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Kuczynski has denied wrongdoing but announced his resignation earlier on Wednesday after a fresh scandal over alleged vote-buying destroyed his chances of defeating a vote to force him from office.

Kuczynski will have presidential immunity from prosecution until Congress formally accepts his resignation, likely on Friday, according to the president of Congress.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly, the isolated state's rubber-stamp parliament, will hold a meeting on April 11, the North's state media said on Thursday, just weeks before an historic summit between North and South Korea.
The decision to hold the rare meeting, which will be the first this year, was made by the assembly's presidium on March 15, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) report said without elaborating.
The North's parliament usually serves to approve decisions on issues such as governing structures and budgets that have been created by the state's powerful Workers' Party, members of which form the vast majority of the assembly. 
Next month's assembly will come against a backdrop of diplomatic activity taking place to engage North Korea and as South Korean officials prepare for the inter-Korean summit later in April.
That summit will precede a possible meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un slated for the following month.
""The April assemblies are regular meetings where North Korea makes decisions on key state projects,"" said Koh Yu-hwan, professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul.
""This time, we're looking at inter-Korean summits and the U.S.-North Korea summit, so there may be some measures or speeches linked to those but we'll have to see,"" Koh said.
Choi Dae-seok, professor of North Korean Studies at Ewha Womans University, said the North's parliament may address economic issues, as it usually does in the spring months, more than denuclearization or inter-Korean relations. 
Kim and Trump are due to meet in May after South Korean officials relayed a message from Pyongyang that the North Korean leader wished to speak to Trump about denuclearization.
The detente with the North, which began in January, came after a year in which Pyongyang staged several missile launches and its biggest-ever nuclear test. That was accompanied by an exchange of insults and threats between Kim and Trump that fueled tensions even further. 
The Supreme People's Assembly convenes once or twice a year for day-long meetings. Its previous meeting was in April last year, when it announced the formation of a diplomatic commission aimed at improving international relations.

It was not specified in Thursday's KCNA report whether Kim would attend the summit in April.

697,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 04:32AM ET</span>",Chinese paper says China should prepare for military action over Taiwan,"By Ben Blanchard
BEIJING (Reuters) - A widely read Chinese state-run newspaper said on Thursday China should prepare for military action over self-ruled Taiwan, and pressure Washington over cooperation on North Korea, after the United States passed a law to boost ties with Taiwan.
Beijing was infuriated after U.S. President Donald Trump signed legislation last week that encourages the United States to send senior officials to Taiwan to meet Taiwanese counterparts and vice versa.
U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Alex Wong said in Taipei on Wednesday the United States' commitment to Taiwan has never been stronger and the island is an inspiration to the rest of the Indo-Pacific region.
China claims Taiwan as its own and considers the self-ruled island a wayward province, which Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday would face the ""punishment of history"" for any attempt at separatism.
The Global Times said in an editorial China had to ""strike back"" against the law, for example by pressuring the United States in other areas of bilateral cooperation like over North Korea and Iran.
""The mainland must also prepare itself for a direct military clash in the Taiwan Straits. It needs to make clear that escalation of U.S.-Taiwan official exchanges will bring serious consequences to Taiwan,"" said the paper, which is published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily.
""This newspaper has suggested that the mainland can send military planes and warships across the Taiwan Straits middle line. This can be implemented gradually depending on the cross-Straits situation,"" it said.
Underscoring China's concerns, Taiwan's government and the de facto U.S. embassy on the island said a second senior U.S. official would be visiting Taiwan this week, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Manufacturing Ian Steff.
In Beijing, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying reiterated China's opposition to official contacts between the two, urging people to reread Xi's comments from earlier in the week.
""The Chinese people share a common belief that it is never allowed, and it is absolutely impossible, to separate any inch of our great country's territory from China,"" Hua said, quoting Xi.
The island is one of China's most sensitive issues and a potential military flashpoint. Underlining that threat, Taiwan sent ships and an aircraft earlier on Wednesday to shadow a Chinese aircraft carrier group through the narrow Taiwan Strait, its defense ministry said.
China's hostility toward Taiwan has risen since the 2016 election of President Tsai Ing-wen, a member of the island's pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party.

China suspects Tsai wants to push for formal independence, which would cross a red line for Communist Party leaders in Beijing, though Tsai has said she wants to maintain the status quo and is committed to ensuring peace.

PARIS (Reuters) - Teachers, train conductors and airline controllers walked off the job across France on Thursday, disrupting transport and public services in a test of public anger with President Emmanuel Macron's reform drive.
While unions have struggled to rally crowds over the past months, this is the first protest against Macron bringing together public sector workers and railway staff, potentially spelling trouble for the government ahead of a rolling rail strike.
""It's a real mess this morning,"" Didier Samba, who missed his morning commuter train to the suburbs and had more than one hour's wait for the next, said at Paris' Gare du Nord station.
The strike was expected to lead to the cancellation of 60 percent of fast trains, 75 percent of inter-city trains and about 30 percent of Paris airports' flights throughout the day.
Unions said one in four primary schools were on strike, while electricity generation dropped by over three gigawatts (GW), the equivalent of three nuclear reactors, as gas and electricity sector workers joined the strike.
Some 150 protest marches are scheduled, including two rallies starting at around 1300 GMT in Paris. 
Opinion polls show a paradox: a majority of voters back the strike but an even bigger majority back the reforms, including cutting the number of public sector workers and introducing merit-based pay.
That has led the government, which overhauled labor laws last year and is also crafting a series of other sensitive reforms including of unemployment insurance, to say it will stand by its plans, while keeping a close eye on protests. 
On Tuesday, following a retirees' march, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said the government would change tack for the poorest 100,000 out of 7 million pensioners concerned by a tax hike, in a sign that a government that prides itself on being firm on reforms can make exceptions.
""What we need to avoid is that all the grievances fuse together, as was the case in 1995,"" a government official said, referring to France's biggest strike in decades, which forced the government of the time to withdraw reforms after striking public and private sector workers received huge popular support.
""The situation is very different from 1995. At the time there was a big discrepancy with what the government had promised during the elections and what they eventually did."" 
Public sector workers are angry with plans to cut public sector headcount by 120,000 by 2022, including with voluntary redundancies, and introduce other reforms including merit-based pay.
Railway workers are worried by government plans to scrap job-for-life guarantees, automatic annual pay rises and generous early retirement.
""Discontent and worry are spreading very quickly,"" said Jean-Marc Canon of UGFF-CGT, one of the largest public sector's unions.
While rail workers have planned a three-month rolling strike starting April 3, public sector workers have no plan yet for further labor action but they will meet next week to decide on any possible move.
Thursday's strike, and the government's reaction, will be a test, said Laurent Berger, the head of France's largest union, CFDT.

""Either they (the government) listen to us and it will have been just a warning shot, or they don't listen to us and then, let me tell you that public sector workers are very mobilized,"" he told RTL radio.

Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip, declared a $5,000 reward for anyone who gives information about the suspect's whereabouts. It provided no details on his alleged motive or of an affiliation to any militant group.
Hamdallah and Palestinian security chief Majid Faraj's convoy was attacked by a roadside bomb in Gaza on March 13. They were uninjured.
Hamas security forces put up checkpoints in some Gaza streets, inspecting cars and people's identification papers.
""Security services are tracing him in order to arrest him,"" a statement from the Gaza Interior Ministry said.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Monday blamed Hamas for the attack. His remarks threatened reconciliation efforts to end a decade-old rift between his Fatah faction and the Islamist Hamas group.

The pilot Andrew Hill was performing an acrobatics display at the Shoreham Airshow when the crash occurred, the third - and by far the most deadly - at the event since 2007.
The Hawker Hunter plane, of a type developed by Britain in the 1950s, struck several cars on the major road next to Shoreham airport near Brighton, where the show was taking place.
Hill was seriously injured but survived. Eleven people, some of them in their cars or on the roadside, were killed.

EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Britain's devolved parliaments in Scotland and Wales on Wednesday approved bills that aim to keep their current powers unchanged after Brexit, a backstop in case a dispute with Prime Minister Theresa May's government drags on.
The bills, tabled by the pro-independence Scottish National Party-led government in Edinburgh and its Labour Party-led counterpart in Cardiff, may potentially attract legal challenge from London under Britain's constitutional arrangements. 
That would add a layer of complication for May's Conservative government and undermine her authority while she has her hands full with the thorny process of Britain's exit from the European Union.
All parties say they are still hopeful of a solution.
Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones said he preferred his concerns to be reflected in the legislation the UK government has itself tabled for Britain's post-Brexit legal framework, currently making its way through the national parliament. 
In the absence of an agreement on that, however, this bill was necessary, he said.
""Our strong preference remains for satisfactory, UK-wide legislation with a (UK) EU withdrawal bill which is amended to ensure devolution is respected. However, we have introduced the Continuity Bill because the UK government has been so slow and reluctant to recognise our legitimate concerns,"" he said.
Wales and Scotland are at loggerheads with London over what clout they should have after Britain's departure from the EU. They say May's government is not taking them fully into account in the remapping of powers which Brexit necessitates, something the UK government denies.
Powers which are currently devolved to Edinburgh and Cardiff, such as over agriculture and fisheries, will come back to the national parliament once Britain leaves the EU. Edinburgh and Cardiff are concerned that the British government plans what they call a ""power grab"" to keep those powers in London.
Both parliaments have pressed on with their own bills as a backstop in case a deal cannot be reached, but have made more positive statements on an agreed outcome recently. 
Both bills were passed by a large margin, a measure of the strength of feeling in support of devolution across party lines, with May's Conservatives standing as the main party to vote against the legislation in Edinburgh.

Iran-backed, Shi'ite Hezbollah is part of Lebanon's coalition government and wields extensive influence in Lebanese politics. Nasrallah was speaking on television about the group's platform for parliamentary elections in May. 
""The danger reaches to the level of an existential threat to the state and to the country, and to the security and stability of society if the financial situation and spending continue like this,"" he said. 
He urged measures to rationalize spending, reduce public debt and combat corruption and wastefulness, but without giving specifics. 
Lebanon has a debt-to-GDP ratio of about 150 percent, one of the highest in the world, and has endured years of weak economic growth since the start of war in neighboring Syria in 2011. 
The cabinet has agreed on a budget for 2018 and aims to push it through the parliament before a meeting of international donors in Paris early next month. 

The International Monetary Fund, which expects Lebanon's economy to grow about 1-1.5 percent this year, said last month that its debt trajectory was unsustainable and fiscal and structural reforms are needed urgently.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Council President Donald Tusk said on Wednesday he offered no congratulations for what he called Vladimir Putin's ""reappointment"" as president, because of a spy poisoning case for which Britain blames Russia.
Tusk's comment points to divisions over Russia at the heart of the European Union, whose other top official, European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker, congratulated Putin in a letter that did not mention the poisoning in southern England.
""After the Salisbury attack, I'm not in the mood to celebrate President Putin's reappointment,"" Tusk told reporters when asked the reason for his silence. Putin secured a fourth term in elections on Sunday.
Following the poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, London on Wednesday accused Moscow of running an assassination programme to eliminate its enemies.
Russia denies responsibility and has said Britain may have orchestrated the poisoning itself. The two countries have expelled diplomats in the standoff.
In his short letter on Tuesday, Juncker said he hoped Putin would help ""re-establish a cooperative pan-European security order"" after ties with the West soured over Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Kiev and support for rebels in east Ukraine.
Juncker, a former prime minister of Luxembourg, has long advocated working with Moscow for a security cooperation ""from Lisbon to Vladivostok"", an idea that is anathema to Russia hawks within the EU.
Sweden, Finland and Britain, as well as the ex-communist states on the EU's eastern flank - the three Baltic countries and Poland, which Tusk led as prime minister from 2007-2014 - advocate a tough line on Moscow.
The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe - a rights watchdog - said Sunday's election there had offered no real political choice and been marked by unfair pressure on critical voices.
Reuters reporters in polling stations across Russia have also documented irregularities.
MIXED RESPONSE
Juncker faced criticism over his letter in Brussels on Wednesday, with a liberal group in the European Parliament saying: ""We do not think that Putin's illiberal policies and election strategies deserve congratulations.""
A second, conservative faction called the letter ""nauseating"". There was no immediate comment from Juncker. 
Further highlighting divisions, German Chancellor Angela Merkel also offered congratulations and urged Putin to ""pursue dialogue"", while French President Emmanuel Macron, in a call, ""offered... his wishes for success with the modernisation of the country on the political, democratic, economic and social fronts.""
British Prime Minister Theresa May will ask her fellow EU leaders on Thursday to condemn Russia over the Salisbury attack. 
A draft joint summit statement seen by Reuters says the bloc ""takes extremely seriously the United Kingdom... assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible"" for the poisoning.

Diplomats said leaders were likely to settle on stronger language in attributing guilt to Russia, though some - including Hungary and Greece - favour greater caution.

The poll, by GEA/ISA, shows two-time runnerup Lopez Obrador grew almost four percentage points to 26.8 percent of vote preference, compared with the firm's previous survey.
The poll of 1,070 people was taken face to face between March 1 and 3 and has a margin of error of 3 percent. The prior poll was taken in November.
The former Mexico City Mayor Lopez Obrador leads all major polls ahead of the election.
Second-place candidate Ricardo Anaya, with the right-left ""For Mexico in Front"" coalition, maintained 23 percent of the vote in the GEA/ISA poll. Jose Antonio Meade, with the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) grew slightly to 20.3 percent.
Independents took 2 percent of the vote, while around 28 percent were undecided, did not respond or said they will not vote.

Other recent polls taken around the same time gave Lopez Obrador a much wider lead. Parametria gave Lopez Obrador a 14 percentage point-lead over Anaya, while Ipsos put the gap at 13.6 percentage points.

The 27 leaders, who will meet Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday, will endorse an interim deal struck by EU negotiators on Monday to grant London a 21-month, status quo transition period to help businesses adjust to Brexit, due in March, 2019.
A written declaration reflecting that was held up for redrafting after Spain sought a reiteration of its interests being protected over Gibraltar, the British territory on its south coast, which will also be leaving the European Union. 
Summit chair Donald Tusk said on Wednesday that Spain had agreed to the new wording.
Ireland has also been anxious to ensure Britain makes good on promises to solve difficulties on their mutual border.
The text reminds London that the agreement on the transition will only become legally binding once the whole treaty on Britain's exit from the bloc is agreed and ratified, probably not until early next year.
""The European Council welcomes the agreement reached by the negotiators on parts of the legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement covering citizens' rights, the financial settlement, a number of other withdrawal issues and the transition,"" it read.
""The European Council recalls that other issues still require agreement and negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full, and welcomes in this respect Prime Minister May's written assurances notably regarding Ireland/Northern Ireland.""

The last time that prisoners were released en masse was in May 2016 by former president Robert Mugabe when prisons were struggling to feed inmates due to lack of funding from the government.
The notice did not give a reason for the amnesty, which is permitted by the constitution. But the move by Mnangagwa, nicknamed ""Crocodile"" for his reputation as an insular and ruthless politician before his rise to power, comes just months before presidential elections.
The Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) said the pardon would decongest Zimbabwe's prisons which have around 20,000 inmates but a holding capacity of only 17,000.
The pardon will benefit all female prisoners except those sentenced to death or facing life sentences, all juveniles and all people jailed for less than 36 months.
It will not be extended to those released during previous amnesties but jailed again, or to those convicted of murder, treason, rape and armed robbery.

""I hope after all the processes we will go through, 3,000 people will benefit,"" Alford Mashango, ZPCS's assistant commissioner told reporters.

LONDON (Reuters) - James Ibori, a Nigerian politician who spent years in UK jails after pleading guilty to laundering a stolen fortune in Britain, launched an appeal against his conviction on Wednesday, alleging corruption in the ranks of British police.
At stake are about 90 million pounds ($130 million) of Ibori's assets, which have been frozen for years. The British authorities aim to confiscate them and return them to the Nigerian state, but if Ibori's conviction were overturned he would regain control of them.
As governor of oil-producing Delta State from 1999 to 2007, Ibori became one of Nigeria's most powerful men and enjoyed a millionaire lifestyle, with properties and luxury cars in several countries. At the time of his arrest he was in the process of buying a $20 million private jet.
His conviction in 2012, after he admitted 10 counts of fraud and money-laundering, was a rare example of a big player in Nigerian politics being held to account for the corruption that has blighted Africa's most populous nation.
But Ibori's lawyers allege that one of the British police officers who investigated him took bribes in 2007 from a private detective, hired by a British law firm working for Ibori, in return for inside information about the police investigation.
They also allege that British anti-corruption police who were supposed to investigate the alleged bribery instead covered it up to avoid scuppering Ibori's trial and tarnishing the reputation of the police. 
All the people against whom allegations of corruption or bad faith have been made have denied them.
The appeal hearing, being held before three judges at London's Court of Appeal, is due to last three days.
Ibori was released from jail in December 2016 after serving half of his 13-year sentence, as is normal in Britain, and he returned to Nigeria in February 2017. He has re-emerged in public life there and been feted at various events.
He was due to give evidence on Wednesday via video-link from Nigeria, and he appeared briefly on a screen in court, but the connection was lost and could not be restored. The court was told a power cut in Nigeria was the reason for the glitch.
Despite being a major oil and gas producer, Nigeria has daily electricity cuts - a result of decades of corruption and mismanagement in the power sector.

The judges instructed that a new attempt be made to establish a video-link to Ibori on Thursday.

713,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",Detained African migrants stuck in limbo in wartime Yemen,"ADEN (Reuters) - Anxious and hungry, hundreds of African migrants lie cramped together on the ground of a open-air warehouse in the southern Yemeni port city of Aden.
Most are from desperately poor Horn of Africa countries and like tens of thousands each year, were willing to risk the treacherous journey through war-torn and impoverished Yemen in the hope of finding work in Saudi Arabia and other wealthy Gulf Arab states. 
But their plan was not to be. Caught and detained by the Yemeni authorities, the 600 or so men now await deportation, prevented from leaving their makeshift jail by armed soldiers.
Conditions at the warehouse are growing increasingly desperate. Several days ago, the authorities stopped handing out food and basic supplies. 
""I came from Djibouti to work. They used to give us small amounts of food. If there is no food, we will die,"" said one migrant who declined to give his name. 
""If there is no solution, they will deport us to our countries or get us out of here"", the man added.
Yemen, the poorest country on the Arabian Peninsula, has long been a transit point for migrants and refugees from East Africa, many of whom are fleeing hunger and violence.
The route was unsafe long before Yemen descended into all-out war in 2015. Hundreds drown each year on the perilous sea journey, and those who make it face multiple risks, including death by ""assault, extortion and abuse by criminal networks, as well as the hazards stemming from the war in Yemen itself"", according to UNHCR, the United Nations' refugee agency.
Despite these dangers, the number of migrants traveling across the Gulf of Aden and Red Sea to Yemen has been rising steadily, to 117,000 in 2016 from 92,000 in 2015, according to UNHCR. 
Khaled al-Elwany, a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants back to their home countries, says up to 15,000 migrants are arrested at city checkpoints each month.
Elwany says he was fired by the interior ministry for refusing to cooperate with a plan to relocate the center to a neighboring province and after authorities stopped food supplies. 
A ministry official told Reuters that the aim of the move to a new facility had been to improve conditions for the migrants while they await deportation. 
Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to restore Yemen's exiled government to power and roll back the Iran-aligned Houthi movement.
While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern areas, a budget crunch and rivalries with local armed groups mean its officials mostly reside abroad.
State services and salaries have been hit hard by the chaos, and the African migrants appear to be a lower priority.
The frightened men in the Aden warehouse, subsisting on bread bought with meager savings and washing their clothes in an rubbish-strewn outdoor space, are just the tip of the iceberg.

Euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal in the Netherlands under very strict conditions and when overseen by medical professionals.
Assisting a suicide or providing a means to commit suicide outside of the strict euthanasia criteria is punishable with a jail term of up to three years.  
Prosecutors said in a statement they would look into the association calling itself the ""Final Wish"" cooperative and had ordered it to cease all activities.
The group said in September it would make a so-called suicide powder available to some registered members. It grabbed headlines this month after a 19-year-old Dutch woman killed herself using a substance believed to be the same as the one the association is referring to.
The substance is reportedly made with legally available ingredients used to preserve food and combat bacteria and moulds in laboratories. Prosecutors said the group, which promotes the powder as ""Substance X"", had plans to provide it to roughly 1,000 members.
In 2016, the latest year for which figures are available, there were more than 6,000 reported cases of euthanasia or medically assisted suicide in the Netherlands. That makes up roughly 4 percent of all deaths that year in the Netherlands. 
Euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal in the Netherlands only if carried out by doctors. Strict oversight laws state that a patient must first have to be found to be suffering unbearably, with no chance of improvement. The request must be made repeatedly and when the patient is of sound mind.
Every case must be checked by a second doctor before a patient dies, and reviewed by an independent panel of experts. 
There is an ongoing discussion in the Netherlands about widening euthanasia criteria to allow elderly people who feel their life has been ""completed"" to seek assisted suicide. 
Polls last year showed 62 percent of Dutch people support a law making that possible, with strong opposition from Christian parties.

Four of the incidents concerned sexually exploitative relations with adults and the fifth concerned the sexual abuse of a minor, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric was cited as saying late on Tuesday in a transcript sent to Reuters on Wednesday.
Sexually exploitative relations usually refers to paying for sex with women from vulnerable communities.
A flurry of sexual misconduct or abuse claims against aid workers and peacekeepers has become a huge embarrassment for the humanitarian sector in the past six months.
Forty allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse were made during the past three months of 2017 against U.N. peacekeeping missions, agencies, funds and programs and implementing partners, it said last month.
The new incidents highlighted took place in North and South Kivu provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where a U.N. peacekeeping presence has kept a variety of predatory militia groups at bay.
""The mission will continue to monitor their well‑being and needs, as well as provide any additional assistance, such as the collection of DNA samples for paternity testing,"" Dujarric said of the victims. 
The United Nations has tried to improve transparency in how it deals with such accusations over the past few years, after a string of sexual exploitation and abuse charges were made against U.N. peacekeepers in Central African Africa.
Charities have also come under the spotlight and several have pledged to overhaul their approach to dealing with allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment. 
But the South African peacekeeping contingent in Congo has repeatedly faced such allegations. 
""Allegations against this contingent continue to occur, despite our sustained efforts ... to prevent and address sexual exploitation and abuse, as well as other forms of misconduct,"" Dujarric said.

The three-judge appeals court in southern Brazil will rule Monday on the final procedural appeals by Lula's legal team. The same court already upheld Lula's conviction on taking bribes and money laundering.
If the judges unanimously reject all the former president's appeals, it means that an order for Lula to begin serving his 12-year sentence could be issued a day or two afterward, even as Lula appeals to higher courts.
Lula, Brazil's first working-class president, oversaw years of robust growth and falling inequality during a commodity boom last decade and has said he wants to run again for the presidency in October. He leads all early polls.
There is a chance Lula could avoid prison, however, because of a recent push by several members of Brazil's Supreme Court to open debate this week or next on its own 2016 ruling that defendants could begin serving prison sentences after their conviction was upheld on a first appeal.

Before that, all possible appeals had to be heard before a defendant could be sent to prison. Critics said that fomented a culture of impunity, as those wealthy enough to afford a protracted appeals process in Brazil's complex and badly backlogged legal system easily avoided jail time.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday charged her new government with healing divisions in German society that have fueled the far-right, equipping the economy for the digital era and bolstering the European project.
Delivering her first government statement to parliament since beginning her fourth term last week, Merkel defended her 2015 decision to welcome more than 1 million migrants but said there could be no repeat of the influx.
Society had grown more divided and angst-ridden, said the chancellor, 63, whose fourth term is likely to be her last.
""Something has changed in our country,"" she told the Bundestag lower house of parliament. ""Although our country is doing well, although our economy is doing its best since reunification, many people are worried about the future.""
Such angst, she conceded, hurt both her conservatives and their Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners in last September's national election, when the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) surged into parliament for the first time.
The AfD now leads the opposition, with the two groups in parliament - Merkel's conservative bloc and the SPD - allied in their ruling ""grand coalition"".
""At the end of this legislative period, I would like people to conclude that our society has become more humane, that divisions and polarization were reduced and perhaps even overcome, and social cohesion increased,"" Merkel said.
Playing on the catchphrase ""wir schaffen das"" (""we can do this"") that she employed at the height of the refugee crisis, Merkel said Germany could become a more cohesive society and make the technological advances to be ready for the future.
""I am convinced, Germany can do this - and Germany means all of us,"" she said.
To help assuage popular concerns, Merkel said the government would raise research and development spending to shape up the economy, which is enjoying robust growth but risks losing out to peers unless its businesses embrace new digital technologies.
She wanted the government to get Germany ""a good way down the path into the digital age"" by the end of the parliament, due in 2021, and to be able to see that ""Europe is strengthened.""
She also charged her ministers with generating more cohesion in society at large, and - without naming him - put down her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, who last week told mass-selling newspaper Bild: ""Islam does not belong to Germany.""
Merkel acknowledged Germany's Judo-Christian historical background, before adding to loud applause: ""Islam has become part of Germany.""
Describing the world as ""uncomfortable and confusing"", she said Germany must secure its future in a reformed Europe that would keep friendly, close ties with Britain, with which a ""very detailed, thorough free trade agreement"" must be negotiated.
""We stand by Britain's side in solidarity,"" Merkel said with reference to a nerve agent attack in England. ""A lot of indications point to Russia. That is why transparency is demanded of Russia.""

Merkel also criticized U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to introduce tariffs on steel and aluminum imports as ""unlawful"" and warned Washington that the European Union was ready to take countermeasures if necessary.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has had constructive talks about the Iran nuclear deal with Britain, France and Germany but is making contingency plans should they fail, the lead U.S. negotiator said on Wednesday.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave an ultimatum on Jan. 12 to the European powers, saying they must agree to ""fix the terrible flaws"" of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal or he would refuse to extend the U.S. sanctions relief on Iran that it calls for. U.S. sanctions will resume unless Trump again waives them on May 12.
""We have had constructive talks with the Europeans towards a supplemental agreement but I can’t predict whether we will reach an agreement with them or not,"" Brian Hook, the State Department policy planning director, told reporters in a conference call.
""We are engaged in contingency planning because it would not be responsible not to,"" said Hook, the lead U.S. negotiator in the talks with the Europeans. ""We are kind of dual tracking this.""
Hook held talks with the three European powers in Berlin on Thursday followed by wider talks on Friday in Vienna with a group that tracks the implementation of the nuclear deal negotiated under former President Barack Obama's administration.
The United States also had a bilateral meeting with Iran in Vienna to demand the release of U.S. citizens held by Tehran, Hook said.
A senior Iranian foreign ministry official confirmed that the United States had raised the issue in the bilateral talks, saying that the Iranian side had responded that this was a matter for the Iranian judiciary, which acts independently.
""However, on humanitarian grounds, we said we will do whatever possible,"" added the Iranian official on condition of anonymity. He also said the issue was discussed with the foreign minister of Oman when he visited Tehran earlier this month.
The crux of the 2015 agreement between Iran and six major powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - was that Iran would restrict its nuclear program in return for relief from sanctions that have crippled its economy.
Trump sees three defects in the deal: its failure to address Iran's ballistic missile program; the terms under which international inspectors can visit suspect Iranian nuclear sites; and ""sunset"" clauses under which limits on the Iranian nuclear program start to expire after 10 years. He wants all three strengthened if the United States is to stay in the deal.
Iran is technically complying with the agreement, Hook said.
However, he repeated the Trump administration view Iran is violating the deal's preamble, which expressed the expectation that the agreement's ""full implementation ... will positively contribute to regional and international peace and security.""
Some analysts reject this stance, arguing the expression of this expectation did not imply a commitment on Iran's part.
Iran argues it is not receiving the full benefits of the sanctions relief, in part because big banks have continued to stay away for fear of falling foul of remaining U.S. sanctions.
Hook said he had rejected this argument.
""Iran’s opaque economy makes it hard for investors to know whether they’re supporting commerce or supporting terrorism,"" he said. ""Iran needs to stop sponsoring terrorism and overhaul its banking and business sectors.""
He also played down Iranian concerns that Trump has yet to approve licenses for Western aircraft companies to sell to Iran although the Obama administration did so.
""I said to them you use your commercial airlines to move terrorists and weapons around the Middle East, including to Syria, and we will not issue licenses at the expense of our national security,"" Hook said.

European planemaker Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) have agreed to sell a total of 180 jets to renew the ageing fleet of state carrier IranAir, but depend on U.S. support for the deal because of the number of U.S. parts in all their jets.

DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Turkish Kurds turned an annual cultural festival into a rare mass political protest on Wednesday against the government's two-month-old military campaign against a Kurdish militia in neighboring Syria.
At a rally to mark the spring festival of Newroz in the southern city of Diyarbakir, demonstrators said Ankara risked provoking violence at home if it pressed on with its Syria offensive.
The event was the first major public demonstration against the campaign in Syria, in which the Turkish army has battled a Kurdish militia, the YPG, which Turkey says is an extension of the banned PKK, or Kurdistan Workers Party. It fell just days after Turkish forces stormed the Syrian city of Afrin.
In a city still scarred by fighting between the PKK and Turkish troops, young women and men linked hands and danced to traditional Kurdish music in the warm spring sunshine, chanting for Afrin and jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan.
""Long live the Afrin resistance,"" sang the crowd.
Political rallies are heavily restricted in Turkey's state of emergency imposed in the wake of an attempted coup in 2016. Hundreds of people were arrested across Turkey in the runup to the Diyarbakir rally, accused of planning illegal protests.
Celebrating Newroz, the Persian New Year which falls on the Spring Equinox, has long been a mark of national pride for Kurds, who make up around a fifth of the population of Turkey, mainly in the southeast. Demonstrations for the holiday frequently led to violence during the PKK's 40-year insurgency.
Southeastern Turkey saw an escalation of violence after a ceasefire between the Turkish state and the PKK collapsed in 2015. Much of Diyarbakir’s historic heart, the Sur district ringed by Roman-era walls, was left in ruins.
Although fighting inside Turkey has subsided since then, the army's two-month-old cross border campaign against the YPG in Syria has again raised passion among Turkey's Kurds. 
President Tayyip Erdogan has vowed to extend the offensive beyond Afrin to other YPG-held areas. If that happens, said Ziya Pir, a parliamentarian from the pro-Kurdish opposition HDP party, ""there will not just be an emotional rupture between Turkey and the Kurds here, it will go further and none of us want to see that"".
Many Turkish Kurds have close ties to the YPG and the conflict across the frontier. One woman at the demonstration said her daughter left university to join the YPG after being detained and tortured in Diyarbakir, and had fought Islamic State in Iraq and Syria where she was killed.
A cousin of hers also went to Afrin, and her fate remains unknown, said the woman who declined to give her name.
EVEN IF WE DIE
""My surviving children and I will continue with this struggle even if we die,"" she told Reuters.
Erdogan's government says its offensive targets militants who pose a direct threat to Turkey's security. The local head of his ruling AK Party in Diyarbakir, Serdar Budak, said Turkey's enemy was the YPG, not the Kurdish people.
""If they have suffered harm, the wounds of all civilians will be bandaged,"" he told Reuters.
Pir said there was ""no concrete justification"" for Turkey to send troops into northern Syria. The displacement of 200,000 people in Afrin and looting by Turkey's Free Syrian Army rebel allies showed that ""what Turkey did is wrong, not just in a legal sense but also in a human sense.""
Another HDP politician, Berdan Ozturk, criticized the lack of international intervention to prevent what he said was Turkey's occupation of Afrin, a sentiment echoed by many in the crowd, where purple and green flags of the HDP were waving.

""Afrin belongs to the Kurds but Turkey occupied it. Hundreds of thousands fled,"" said Tarik Dalkiran, a 52-year-old farmer from Bismil district of Diyarbakir province. ""Britain, France, America, nobody did anything. I have lost faith in the West.""

For ""Radiance"", which opened in London this week, Zhuang, 55, has created dozens of floral scenes by mounting thousands of flowers made from rice paper onto canvas and then painting them to add color and texture.
The works change color depending on the angle from which they are viewed.
Zhuang's floral creations are influenced by materials from his native China - rice paper - and the flowered landscape of his adopted country - the Netherlands.
""I am from China and then I studied in Holland, I got a lot of influence from Western culture. So my work always contrasts two cultures and also the composition of the painting also is in contrast,"" Zhuang told Reuters.
Zhuang's creations have won him increasing critical and commercial success: he has exhibited at galleries and art fairs across Europe and the United States and is described by the exhibition organizers as the top-selling Asian artist in Britain.
""Radiance"" runs until March 24 at the House of Fine Art (HOFA) gallery in London's St. James district, before moving to a separate HOFA gallery in Mayfair from March 26 to April 8.

Russians and Ukrainians have traveled freely between each other's countries since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, but Kiev has sought to implement a stricter regime in the wake of Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and role in the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Poroshenko has now signed a decree that will require Russians and citizens of certain other countries to notify the Ukrainian authorities in advance about their reason for traveling to Ukraine.
This is aimed at ""safeguarding state security and neutralizing threats in the areas of migrations and citizenship"", Poroshenko's administration said in a statement.
The decree relates to ""foreigners, particularly citizens of the Russian Federation and individuals without citizenship, who come from migration risk countries"", the statement said, without giving further details on which countries this concerned.
According to the Ukrainian state border service, there were 1.5 million trips by Russians to Ukraine in 2017. 
The government has a month to implement the decision, but it is not clear when the new rule will come into force.
At the start of 2018, Ukraine introduced biometric controls for Russians entering the country, but the government has stopped short of imposing a formal visa regime.
Relations between Kiev and Moscow are at an all-time low after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula and backed pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donbass region in an ongoing conflict that has killed over 10,000 people.

Prosecutors have placed five employees at Austria's BVT intelligence agency under investigation based on accusations they failed to delete sensitive information and may have intended to pass it on. 
But the case has prompted accusations by the opposition of a purge at the BVT by the far-right Freedom Party (FPO), which controls the Interior Ministry.
The German agency sought clarification from the BVT ""on whether and if so what BfV information is affected"" by the raids, the Interior Ministry in Berlin said in a written response to a lawmaker from the leftist Linke party, Andrej Hunko.
""An answer from the BVT is still pending. If BfV information actually did leak, there will have to be a new assessment of how cooperation with the BVT can be carried out in future,"" it added in the letter dated March 20, which Hunko posted on his website.
As the junior coalition partner in Austria's government, the FPO also controls the defense ministry and oversees much of the security and intelligence apparatus, including the BVT.
Interior Minister Herbert Kickl says the case has been handled properly, but questions have persisted, including why the raids were carried out by police not normally tasked with such operations -- a street-crime unit headed by an FPO town councillor.
Storage devices including hard drives were seized during raids on the homes of at least one witness as well as the five accused, who include BVT head Peter Gridling.
The government has not named the other suspects and their political affiliations remain unclear. Until the FPO took it over three months ago, the Interior Ministry had long been controlled by Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conservatives.
Gridling told the Tiroler Tageszeitung newspaper last week he did not know what he was accused of and was unaware of having done anything wrong.
The case has stoked fears about intelligence being available to the FPO, which has ties with some right-wing groups monitored by the BVT as well as to Russian President Vladimir Putin's United Russia party.
The opposition Social Democrats said on Tuesday they would launch a parliamentary commission of inquiry into the case.

726,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2018 03:24AM ET</span>",Peru prosecutors seek to bar toppled president from leaving country: source,"By Mitra Taj and Marco Aquino
LIMA (Reuters) - Anti-graft prosecutors in Peru on Wednesday asked a judge to bar President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski from leaving the South American country hours after he announced his resignation in the face of near-certain impeachment, a judiciary source told Reuters.
Kuczynski, a 79-year-old former Wall Street banker who once held U.S. citizenship, is guaranteed presidential immunity from prosecution until Congress formally accepts his resignation and Vice President Martin Vizcarra is sworn in to replace him.
Luis Galarreta, the president of Congress, said that would probably happen on Friday.
Kuczynski denies wrongdoing and has promised to cooperate with a graft probe into his connections to Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company that has acknowledged bribing officials across Latin America.
The rightwing opposition party that controls Congress, Popular Force, first sought to force Kuczynski from office in December after revealing he failed to disclose payments Odebrecht made to his Flordia-based consulting firm while he held public office in a previous government.
Kuczynski had vowed not to resign for months, blaming the rightwing opposition for constant scandals that he said had made it impossible for him to govern Peru, one of Latin America's most stable markets and the world's No. 2 producer of copper.
But secret audio and video recordings released this week ensnared Kuczynski in vote-buying allegations that prompted even his staunchest supporters to demand he step down.
Kuczynski said the material, in which his allies are heard offering access to lucrative public work contracts in exchange for political support, had been edited as part of a relentless campaign to malign him.
But the hostile political climate had become untenable, he added.
""I think what's best for the country is for me to resign...I don't want to be an obstacle for the nation's search for a path to unity and harmony,"" Kuczynski said in a pre-recorded video televised as he was driven from the presidential palace to his home in Lima's financial district.
MARKETS RALLY
Kuczynski's announcement marked a spectacular downfall for a man elected less than two years ago amid hopes he would turbocharge growth while cleaning up government corruption and modernizing the Andean nation of about 30 million people.
Markets that had cheered Kuczynski's rise to power in 2016 rallied on news of his departure on Wednesday, amid expectations it would end the political uncertainty that had loomed over the nearly $200-billion economy, just as higher copper prices were reviving investor interest.
Peru's sol currency gained 0.5 percent against the dollar on Wednesday, and stocks closed up 1 percent.
But Kuczynski's future looked less bright.
Prosecutors in a special anti-corruption unit in the attorney general's office told a judge Kuczynski should not be allowed to leave the country, the judiciary source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Kuczynski said as a candidate in 2016 that he had renounced his U.S. citizenship in order to launch his bid. Last month, U.S. Ambassador to Peru Krishna Urs declined to confirm that Kuczynski no longer had citizenship.
Kuczynski's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
TRUMP TO HEAD TO PERU
Peru has a history of jailing former presidents, and of presidents fleeing.
Former authoritarian president Alberto Fujimori fled Peru for his parents' native Japan as his decade in power ended in a corruption scandal and protests.
Last year, former president Ollanta Humala, Kuczynski's predecessor, was ordered up to 18 months in pre-trial detention while prosecutors prepare charges related to Odebrecht.
Kuczynski had been scheduled to welcome Donald Trump on the U.S. president's first visit to Latin America next month, when many regional leaders plan to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to pursue democratic reforms.
Kuczynski, who called Maduro a ""dictator"" in an interview with Reuters last year, had led regional criticism of his government while opening the door to Venezuelan migrants fleeing the country's economic crisis.
A White House official, speaking on background, said Trump still plans to attend the summit and declined to comment on Peru's domestic political situation.
Instead of Kuczynski, Trump will meet Vizcarra at the Summit of the Americas that Peru will host on April 13 and 14. 
A former governor of a mining region, Vizcarra once helped broker  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc secure community support for its copper project, Quellaveco, and has served as Peru's ambassador to Canada since September. 
But Vizcarra will take office amid widespread demands for change after constant political crises and corruption scandals have eroded trust in institutions and political leaders.
Vizcarra took to Twitter from Canada to call for unity.
""I'm outraged by the current situation, like the majority of Peruvians,"" Vizcarra said in his first public comments since Kuczynski announced his resignation. ""But I'm convinced that together we can show that we can once more push forward."" 
In recent days, Vizcarra has received public assurances from opposition lawmakers that they will let him govern, something Kuczynski said he had been denied.

""I've worked for nearly 60 years of my life with complete honesty,"" Kuczynski added. ""The opposition has tried to depict me as a corrupt person.""

The doctors immediately said they would not be intimidated and would not return until their demands were met.
Doctors at public hospitals across Zimbabwe have been on strike since March 1 over better pay and working conditions, forcing hospitals to turn away patients.
In a circular to senior health officials, Health Ministry permanent secretary Gerard Gwinji said doctors who had been absent from work for 14 days would be denied their salary and allowances.
But Mxolisi Ngwenya, spokesman for the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association (ZHDA), which represents more than 1,000 members, said doctors would not end the job boycott until Mnangagwa's government agreed to their demands.
""Members have stated that they are not going back to work. Instead of threatening our members, we urge the ministry to go on to resolve the root issues as they are aware that we have genuine grievances,"" Ngwenya said.
Mnangagwa replaced Robert Mugabe in November after a de facto army coup and faces his first election in July. Fixing the economy is his main challenge.

Health Minister David Parirenyatwa told the state-owned Herald newspaper that the government had no money to meet the demands by doctors and urged them to return to work while negotiations continued.

The Spanish region has been in political limbo since December elections called by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy in an attempt to derail an independence movement. The plan backfired as parties favoring a split with Spain won the election.
Madrid invoked special powers to take over the regional government after the Catalan administration declared independence in October. The wealthy populous region has been ruled by the central government ever since. 
Former regional head Carles Puigdemont, who is in self-imposed exile in Brussels, and Jordi Sanchez, a leader of a prominent grassroots group who is in jail over his role in the illegal campaign to split from Spain, have both withdrawn their bids because they could not attend a swearing-in session.
The speaker said the next candidate will be proposed in the Catalan parliament on Wednesday, but did not identify him. 
Catalan newspapers said the secessionist parties would propose Jordi Turull, a member of the previous regional administration who was briefly held in custody on charges of rebellion and sedition after his involvement in the independence push in October.
He was released on bail after accepting the central government's control over the region but still faces the prospect of a trial.
It is not yet clear however whether Turull, who is free to attend parliamentary sessions and to be voted in, would be able to become the next president of the region because the central government has made it clear it would stop any candidate who has taken part to the secessionist drive.
Rajoy sacked the Catalan government and took control in October, hours after the Catalan parliament made a unilateral declaration of independence in a vote boycotted by the opposition and declared illegal by Spanish courts.
""I would recommend them to look forward and pick a clean candidate, who abides by the law,"" Rajoy told Spanish lawmakers on Wednesday.

Turull and other secessionist leaders are due to appear before the Supreme Court on Friday for the opening of a new phase in the investigation which leads to a trial.

The Falter weekly published a screenshot of the attache's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page which shows him in a green shirt with the words ""stand your ground"" and ""Frundsberg"". Frundsberg was a German Waffen SS armored division during World War Two.
The attache, Juergen-Michael Kleppich, is a member of the far-right Freedom Party, which is a junior partner in Austria's coalition government. He was sent to Tel Aviv in December to help out at the embassy for a few months, Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl told radio station ORF on Wednesday.
Kleppich was summoned to Vienna to ""clarify all circumstances"" of the case, said Kneissl. It was not immediately clear whether he would be allowed to resume his post in due course. 
The incident is the latest in a series of embarrassments for the anti-immigrant FPO, which in December joined Austria's national government for the first time in more than a decade, and has been trying for years to shed any Nazi associations. 
The party was founded by former SS officers in the 1950s but says it has left its past behind and has regularly expelled officials in recent years over alleged Nazi links.
A high-ranking local party official, who helped lead a far-right fraternity which distributed a songbook that joked about killing Jews, resigned under pressure in February, and a close staff member of Austria's FPO transport minister got involved in another anti-Semitism scandal shortly afterwards. 
Kneissl said she would consult her ministry's human resources department on Kleppich. 
""If there is a disciplinary cause, a disciplinary procedure will be initiated,"" she said. 
Israel has said it will not do business with FPO ministers, only with the ""operational echelons"" of government departments headed by an FPO minister. 
The FPO controls the foreign, interior and defense ministries. The FPO nominated Kneissl for the post of foreign minister, though she is not officially a member of the party. 
Interior Minister Herbert Kickl, an FPO member, is expected to be questioned in a parliamentary inquiry about police raids targeting Austria's BVT domestic intelligence agency, which investigates far-right activities. Opposition parties have accused Kickl of aiming to gather intelligence on far-right groups and to sideline political opponents.

733,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 10:21AM ET</span>",Identical twins and 'carousels': Russia's fairground election,"UST-DJEGUTA, Russia (Reuters) - Ludmila Sklyarevskaya, a Russian hospital administrator, voted on Sunday in an election that gave Vladimir Putin another term as Russia's president.
Then she went to another polling station and voted again, according to Reuters reporters who witnessed her movements.
Sklyarevskaya, who denied any wrongdoing, was among 17 people who were photographed by Reuters apparently casting ballots at more than one polling station Sunday in the town of Ust-Djeguta, southern Russia.
Many appeared to be state employees, and some showed up in groups and in mini buses bearing the names of state-provided services. 
An employee at the hospital where Sklyarevskaya worked confirmed the woman captured in photos at the two polling stations was Sklyarevskaya and identified her as the hospital's deputy director of health and safety.
Voting twice is a misdemeanor under Russian law, carrying a penalty of a fine. Shown pictures of some of the people who apparently voted twice, including at Ust-Djeguta's polling station no. 217, Leila Koichuyeva, a member of the election commission there, said: ""They could be twins.""
Sklyarevskaya, when it was pointed out she had been seen voting at polling stations 216 and 215, said ""that's not me."" 
Reuters was able to speak to seven of 17 people photographed casting multiple votes. They either denied voting more than once or declined to comment. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were established procedures for reporting election violations. ""If these reports from the respected Reuters agency are backed up by corresponding statements to law enforcement agencies from the observers who were at each polling station, then it's a worry. If they are not backed up, then it does not worry us at all.""
Putin's opponents, and independent election observers, say Sunday's vote was skewed across the country by officials loyal to Putin using a variety of tricks to inflate the turnout.
Putin is genuinely popular but a low turnout caused by apathy at a one-sided contest would have deprived him of the resounding mandate he sought. In the end, he won by a landslide and on a strong turnout of nearly 70 percent.
As well as multiple voting in Ust-Djeguta - a practice known in Russia as a ""carousel"" - Reuters reporters who monitored 12 polling stations around the country witnessed other irregularities though they were mostly narrow in scale.
In all 12 polling stations, the turnout declared by election officials exceeded a tally kept by Reuters of how many people voted. In one case in Simferopol the difference between the two figures was significant: 528 votes, or 66 percent of the votes cast. 
Reuters reporters also uncovered a loophole in the voter registration system that could allow multiple voting by obtaining authorization to vote in more than one location. Under a new system designed to make it easier for people to vote when away from home, a voter can apply online to register temporarily at a different polling station. Three Reuters reporters who registered through the new system as well as at their local election office were able to vote once and then get the go-ahead by officials to vote a second time at a different polling station.
A Central Election Commission spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment.
    
MEDICAL HELP
On election day in Ust-Djeguta, Sklyarevskaya arrived just after 17:30 local time (10.30 a.m. ET), leading a group of eight other women and one man through the gates of polling station number 216.
About twenty minutes later, Reuters reporters observed the same group voting again a few hundred meters away at polling station no. 215.
Several of the women with her were wearing surgical scrubs, and the man wore a jacket with the word ""ambulance"" written on it. Ust-Djeguta, a town of 30,000 people and 1,500 km (930 miles) south of Moscow, has only one hospital, the state-run Central District Hospital.
In an interview next to her office on the hospital's fourth floor, Sklyarevskaya said she had voted only once, at a third polling station, number 217. ""Who directed you to do this investigation?"" she asked when approached by Reuters reporters. ""You do not have the right to get involved in the electoral system.""
Marat Shakmanov, head doctor at the hospital, said he didn't believe anyone from the hospital violated election rules.
Another woman, wearing sparkly heels, also appeared to vote twice on Sunday. 
When approached by Reuters in the town hall on Monday, the woman said her name was Jamila Tebueva, a social-care specialist in the town administration. She said she voted only once, and went to a second polling station to accompany friends. 
When told she had been photographed with a voting slip in her hand at the second location she said: ""Is it alright if I don't reply?""
Zukhra Chomaeva, the head election official at polling station number 217, said she could not answer for what happened outside her precinct when asked about multiple voting.
""How do I know if they're the same person? They might look the same.""
Larissa Tekeyeva, head of the election commission for polling station 216, said after looking at a picture of a woman in a pink coat who voted at polling stations 216 and 217: ""We all have the same mentality. We all look alike.""
Ludmila Djukayeva, head of the town's polling station 215, said she hadn't witnessed any multiple voting. Ruslan Shagarov, a spokesman for the town administration, said he knew nothing about any employees breaking voting rules.  
Official results released on Monday showed the three polling stations had an average turnout of 81.5 percent and delivered a majority for Putin of 89.86 percent. National turnout was 67 percent, according to the central election commission. 
TURNOUT DISCREPANCIES
Reuters reporters used mechanical counters to count everybody who cast a ballot at the 12 polling stations they monitored from open to close on Sunday.
In some places, the discrepancies between the official count and the Reuters tally were small, with local election officials putting it down to the margin of error. But in nine of the 12 polling stations, the discrepancies were 10% or greater.
The biggest divergence, as a share of the total vote, was in polling station number 265, inside a technical college in Simferopol, Crimea. Moscow annexed the region from Ukraine four years ago.
Reuters reporters saw 797 voters at that station, while the official figures state that 1,325 people voted on the day and in person.
Asked about the discrepancy, the chairwoman of the polling station's election commission, Oksana Mediyeva, said independent monitors had watched the vote and had raised no issues.
The three monitors, two from the governing party and one who said he would vote for Putin, didn't appear to be keeping count of the turnout. 
Typically in elections, the official turnout figures are produced when election tellers count the number of ballots cast.
But in three polling stations, in Ust-Djeguta and in Simferopol, the election officials weren't seen physically counting all the ballot papers.
At Ust-Djeguta's polling station number 216, a count revealed there were not enough ballot papers to tally with the figure for Putin votes, of 1,299, that officials there had provisionally penciled in. 
After a recount produced the same outcome, the election officials said they were going home.
When a Reuters reporter asked how they could do that without finishing the count, Tatiana Chernyaeva, the director of the school hosting the polling station, said: ""You want to cast doubt on Putin’s victory.""
    
FLAWED SYSTEM
Under the new registration system the three Reuters reporters were able to register online to vote in one location and also obtain authorization to vote in another location by using the old procedure of going to the local election office where they are resident. 
All three reporters were offered a ballot paper in their second location after they had already voted in their first, though none cast a second vote.

Djukayeva the head of the election commission at polling station 215, where one of the reporters was offered a ballot to cast a second vote, said: “I don’t know whose mistake that was .... They gave us lists yesterday of voters who should be included and excluded."" She was in the list to be included, Djukayeva added.

The Syrian Civil Defence rescue service, which operates in opposition areas, said the air raid took place in the village of Kafr Batikh in the eastern part of Idlib province on Wednesday. 
A war monitor, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, gave the same number of dead and said that 15 were from one family. 
Idlib is the largest, most populous area still held by rebels seeking to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whose forces are backed in the war by Russian air power. 
Assad and his allies are also attacking rebels in eastern Ghouta, near Damascus, in an offensive that has involved intense bombardment. On Wednesday, rebel sources in one part of eastern Ghouta said there was a deal with the government for insurgents there to leave the area for Idlib under safe passage. 
On Monday an airstrike in Arbin in eastern Ghouta killed 15 children and two women sheltering in the basement of a school, the Observatory said.
The government and Russia describe the rebel groups in Syria as terrorists. They have accused the Western-funded Civil Defence, sometimes also called the White Helmets, of working with terrorist groups and fabricating evidence of civilian casualties, which it denies.

The rise of Thierry Baudet and his Forum for Democracy may herald the fragmentation of the Netherlands' far right, which has dominated Dutch politics for more than a decade.
Although the Forum for Democracy's municipal candidates are participating only in the Netherlands' two largest cities, Amsterdam and Rotterdam, one national opinion poll shows it is now the third most popular in the country.
An admirer of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, leader Baudet and his themes of Dutch cultural superiority and distain for the European Union have resonated more strongly with voters than the anti-Islam rhetoric of Geert Wilders, a fixture among European populists since 2006.
Baudet, a swaggering 35-year-old writer whose party won two seats in the March 2017 parliamentary election, was bullish about his party's prospects.
""We can really take a big bite out of the city council,"" he was quoted saying by the ANP News agency as he cast his ballot in the election, being held on the same day as a referendum on whether spy agencies should have the power to install bulk taps on Internet traffic.
Baudet has been called sexist and racist for various remarks, including saying last year that women ""generally excel less in many occupations and lack ambition"" and that Dutch ""people are being homeopathically diluted by mixing them with all the peoples of the world"".
But his words have struck a chord with some and the Forum for Democracy is siphoning off voters from Wilders' Freedom Party, which has lost more than a third of its support and is now polling in seventh place.
Wilders' party, currently the second largest in parliament, has struggled to find suitable candidates to compete in the local elections. It is currently only represented in The Hague and Almere, where it is the largest. 
Anti-migrant sentiment is still playing a part in the election campaign, in which housing shortages and rapidly rising rents have become a central issue. 
Conservative Prime Minister Mark Rutte, whose approval ratings have remained solid amid an economic boom since he formed a third Cabinet in October, campaigned to deny refugees preferential treatment for housing.
""People who come from outside to the Netherlands have to properly take their place at the back of the line,"" Rutte said in an election eve debate.
""But there are still cities that give asylum seekers preference.""
Voting stations close at 9 p.m. (4 p.m. ET), with results of an exit poll by national broadcaster NOS expected by 9:30 p.m. A national election is not due until 2021.

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya should resist rushing into elections this year because the country is too violent and authorities cannot guarantee freedom of assembly or free speech, which are essential for a vote, Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday.
Potential contenders on both sides of Libya's main political divide have called for a vote to resolve an impasse in which the government in the capital has limited authority and largely depends on armed groups for security.
The United Nations helped set up the government in 2016 and says it would like to see elections this year if security and legislative conditions are met.
A voter registration process began in December but no election dates have been set and it is unclear how local, parliamentary and presidential polls would be sequenced.
The last parliamentary elections in 2014 led to rival governments being set up in Tripoli and the east, backed by competing, loose armed alliances.
In the past week, there have been deadly clashes between rival armed factions in the cities of Sabha in the south and Derna in the east. In Tripoli several prominent figures have been kidnapped, including the military prosecutor. 
""Libya today couldn't be further away from respect for the rule of law and human rights, let alone from acceptable conditions for free elections,"" said Eric Goldstein, deputy Middle East and North Africa director for the rights group.
""The authorities need to be able to guarantee freedom of assembly, association and speech to anyone participating in the elections,"" he said in a statement.
One precondition for elections was a judiciary that could resolve disputes, but the justice system was in a state of collapse, HRW said.
""Armed groups have threatened, intimidated, and attacked judges, prosecutors, lawyers, and government officials. Law enforcement and criminal investigation departments around the country are only partially functional, often lacking the ability to execute court-issued summons and arrest warrants. 
""Libya's courts are in no position to resolve election disputes including on registration and results.""
The statement came as the U.N. human rights office said armed groups continued to execute and torture civilians in Libya with almost complete impunity.
The United Nations has pointed to the voter registration process as evidence of Libyans' enthusiasm for elections. Since December, more than 923,000 voters have registered, according to the electoral commission, and more than 2.4 million are now registered nationwide. 
However, analysts say this does not necessarily indicate high turnout, given security challenges and a voting population estimated at between 4.2 and 4.5 million.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland accused the European Union on Wednesday of ""double standards"" in its treatment of member states, a day after Brussels rejected Warsaw's defense of its court reforms that critics say threaten democracy.
The EU has threatened to take punitive action that could include stripping Poland of its voting rights if Warsaw does not retract legislation that tightens state controls over the judiciary.
""Nothing hurts the idea of European integration more than the actual inequality of its member states before the law, the use of double standards and the departure of the European Commission from its role as an objective guardian of treaties to (become) an instrument in the hands of some states,"" Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz told parliament.
Poland argues that in some other EU member states, including Spain and Germany, politicians also play a role in picking some judges. It says its judicial reforms are necessary to improve the efficiency and transparency of Poland's court system.
The right-wing government in Warsaw is at loggerheads with the European Commission, the EU's executive, on a range of issues, including migrant quotas. Poland is refusing to take in some of the mainly Muslim asylum seekers under the quota system.
Czaputowicz, who was briefing lawmakers on the government's foreign policy goals for 2018, said EU institutions were ignoring voters' concerns and that this was feeding a euroskeptic backlash against Brussels.
""A deficit of democracy in the European Union is not a figure of speech, it is reality that has deep political consequences,"" he said.
""The rising wave of opposition to integration on the European continent is not the cause of the democratic weakness of the Union, but a result of it,"" he said, adding that Poland still wanted a ""strong European Union"". 
Despite the strained relations between Warsaw and Brussels, opinion surveys show that support for the EU in Poland - the biggest recipient of EU funds for infrastructure and other projects - is among the highest in the 28-nation bloc.
In his speech, Czaputowicz also stressed Poland's concern that increased EU integration should not lead to a reduced role for the United States in defending Europe.
Poland, a staunch NATO ally, values its close security ties with the United States in the face of a more assertive Russia.

Warsaw and Washington both oppose the planned Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would pump Russian gas directly to western Europe. Germany and Austria support the project.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Armed groups execute and torture civilians in Libya in almost complete impunity seven years after the revolution that toppled Muammar Gaddafi, the United Nations human rights office said on Wednesday.
Libyans and migrants are often held incommunicado in arbitrary detention in appalling conditions, and reports persist of captured migrants being bought and sold on ""open slave markets"", it said in a report to the Human Rights Council. 
Libya is split between rival governments in the east and west while ports and beaches are largely in the hands of armed groups who smuggle mainly African migrants onto boats heading for Italy and Europe.
""Extrajudicial and unlawful killings are rampant,"" Andrew Gilmour, U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, told the Geneva forum.
A video emerged on Jan 24 purportedly showing a special forces field commander Mahmoud al-Werfalli shooting 10 blindfolded men kneeling with their hands tied behind their back, he said. Reuters could not independently confirm the gunman's identity.
Werfalli, a special forces commander attached to Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), has been indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for allegedly overseeing the summary execution of several dozen prisoners.
""In what has become an increasing pattern in and around Benghazi over the last two years, more bodies with signs of torture and hands bound were found in the streets,"" Gilmour said.
Armed groups are ""the main perpetrators of grave human rights violations and act with almost complete impunity"", he said.
Detention centers run by armed groups, ""including those with links to ministries"" have the worst record, he said.
Adel Shaltut, charge d’affaires at Libya's mission to the U.N. in Geneva, said: ""Libya is a victim of illegal migration, it is only a transit country and cannot shoulder all responsibilities. Our coast guards and border guards do not have capacity to face organized crime and terrorism.""
The European Union said that migrants and activists were subjected to ""unlawful detentions, abductions, torture, forced labor and sexual and gender-based violence"".
""We are deeply also concerned about reports of migrants and refugees allegedly being sold as slaves and call on the Libyan authorities to investigate and hold persons responsible for those acts accountable,"" said EU diplomat Carl Hallergard.
Hanan Salah, Libya researcher for Human Rights Watch, denounced ""raging impunity"", adding: ""A political settlement and any semblance of rule of law seem elusive.""
She urged the Council to appoint an independent expert on the country, adding: ""Given the gravity of the situation on the ground in Libya, how can this Council justify the lack of a dedicated monitoring and reporting mechanism?"".

744,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Fear of migrants galvanizes PM Orban's supporters in rural Hungary,"By Krisztina Than
ERCSI, Hungary (Reuters) - Supporters of Hungary's right-wing Fidesz party in Ercsi may not have met a refugee but there's one thing they know for sure: they don't want them in their town. 
Three years after hundreds of thousands of refugees crossed into Hungary en route from the Middle East and Africa to western Europe, residents of this sleepy town south of Budapest say concerns about a migrant ""invasion"" will be a decisive factor when they vote in national elections on April 8.
That suits Fidesz and its leader Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has appealed to the anxieties of his core supporters with talk about the importance of ""ethnic homogeneity"".
""Europe is now under invasion,"" Orban told a rally in Budapest on March 15. ""Their (the opposition's) task is to win power and implement the grand plan: to break Hungary, which stands in the path of immigrants.""
Orban's pledge to preserve Hungary's sovereignty and uphold Christian values, delivered in his trademark bruising, combative manner, has delivered landslide victories in the past two parliamentary elections and is likely to do the same in April.
Orban is seen as one of Europe's most divisive leaders, however. U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein recently accused him of being a racist and xenophobe after he said he did not want his country to be ""multi-colored"". 
Hungary's foreign minister responded that the comments were ""outrageous"" and called on Zeid to resign.
Most of the voters interviewed by Reuters in Ercsi said they had never met a refugee, but that did not stop them identifying immigrants as a danger. 
""We are enough as we are. We don't need any migrants,"" said Maria Pulai, 69, who has been an Orban supporter for more than two decades and now actively campaigns for Fidesz.
She proudly showed a photo with the Hungarian leader taken on her mobile phone when he visited Ercsi to support the local party candidate.
""I have never met (any refugees),"" Pulai said with the trace of a smile. ""But I watch television all the time so I've learned a lot. We do not need them here.""
SHIFT FURTHER RIGHT
Orban has been hitting the country's anti-immigration nerve ever since migrants fleeing war and economic hardship started crossing Hungary's southern border with Serbia in 2015, leading Budapest to shut off the route with a border fence. 
The flow slowed to a trickle in 2016 but Orban has kept up the rhetoric and it is now the backbone of his election agenda. 
With his firm grip on state media and his business allies in control of regional newspapers, Orban's message gets amplified in places like Ercsi, where many people only watch the state news channel showing immigrants causing trouble in western European cities night after night. 
Orban's original vision was that Fidesz would aim to dominate Hungarian politics over the next two decades by standing up for national interests. 
He appealed to conservative Hungarians who believe their country is struggling to protect its identity, a strategy which has worked partly due to a fragmented opposition.
Now he appears to be also seeking to occupy some of the far-right territory abandoned by the radical nationalist opposition party Jobbik, which has toned down its message in an attempt to move toward the center.
  The shift further to the right and to radicalization could be risky for Orban because it's a ""one-way street"", said Peter Kreko, director of liberal Hungarian thinktank Political Capital.
""Fidesz has closed itself into a cage with this campaign which is targeted at its core voters,"" Kreko said. 
In February Jobbik teamed up with the Socialists and the small liberal party LMP to back an independent candidate in a by-election in southern Hungary and unexpectedly beat Fidesz. But it is reluctant to form alliance with the left for the parliamentary elections. 
If Jobbik and the left manage to coordinate and field joint candidates then Fidesz could be in trouble, Kreko said.
""The big test ... will come in April,"" he said. 
Fidesz's voter base has changed in recent years, with some educated conservative voters disappointed by the emphasis on populist anti-migrant messages at the expense of measures to improve healthcare and education.
The party has gained ground with the less educated and pensioners instead, analysts said. To court them, Orban recently announced a one-off handout and state refunds of heating bills.
Orban also plays up the idea that ""external forces and international powers"" like the European Union and the United Nations want to meddle in Hungary's internal affairs and force the country to accept migrants.
Scores gathered in Ercsi's theater in early March to hear a Fidesz lawmaker speak and watch a slideshow about the threats of migration and how Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros is using his network of foundations to foster multicultural societies all over the world.
Orban and Soros, allies in dismantling communism during the 1980s, are now frequently at loggerheads. Orban accuses Soros of interfering in Hungarian politics by supporting opposition groups. Soros has described Orban as a dangerous autocrat.
ECONOMY ON TRACK
Fidesz won the last parliamentary election in 2014 comfortably with 2.26 million votes, or 45 percent of all votes cast. Political analysts estimate the party's core supporters this time at between 1.8 to 2.2 million.
According to Hungarian thinktank Policy Agenda, Fidesz's support in 2014 was strongest in small towns and villages, where jobs are scarce and many people are employed in public works programs, and it has probably managed to retain this support.
On a sunny Sunday in nearby Dunaujvaros, opposite the huge concrete gates of the former communist steelworks, locals flock to a market where they can buy cheap clothes, food and home appliances. Fidesz is campaigning actively on the ground.
Pal Balonyi, a 68-year-old pensioner going to the market with his granddaughter, said he has always been a conservative voter and will vote for Fidesz again in April even if he does not agree with all of the government's policies.
Balonyi, who worked in Germany for three years as a house painter, said Orban had put the economy on the right track and had a clear national vision.

""And he has put Western politicians right, this is also an factor I consider. I have worked abroad, and we are treated like second-class citizens everywhere.""

The opposition party Vetevendosje is adamantly against the agreement with Montenegro, signed in 2015, claiming it will wrongly surrender some 8,000 hectares (30 square miles) of Kosovo's territory to its neighbor.
Previous attempts to ratify the agreement have led to similar protests involving tear gas in the 120-seat parliament and street clashes with police.
The parliament speaker adjourned the session until the room had been ventilated. 
Ratification of the border deal with Montenegro is one of the main conditions for Kosovo citizens to get visa free regime within the EU.

KARACHI (Reuters) - A senior Pakistani policeman accused of a role in police killings surrendered to the Supreme Court on Wednesday after two months on the run, media said, in a case that has stirred anger about extra-judicial killings.
Rao Anwar, senior superintendent of police in the port city of Karachi, was suspended on January 20 after four men were killed in a shoot-out with police.
Police initially said the men were suspected Islamist militants but later suggested the incident may have been an extra-judicial killing.
The shoot-out, in which police gunned down aspiring model Naqibullah Mehsud, has also brought to the fore the issue of racial profiling of Pakistan's Pashtuns, who say they are targeted and harassed because many militants hail from their communities close to the border with Afghanistan.
""Take Rao Anwar into custody,"" Chief Justice Saqib Nisar ordered police after Anwar appeared in court, the English-language Dawn newspaper said. 
Reuters could not immediately reach Anwar's lawyer or other representatives to seek comment.
Television channels earlier broadcast images of Anwar, wearing a surgical mask and flanked by policemen from the Anti-Terrorist Squad, walking into the Supreme Court without handcuffs.
Anwar's arrest came after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) photographs of militant suspect Mehsud, posing with long-flowing hair in trendy clothes for amateur fashion photo shoots, cast doubt on police claims that he was a hardcore Islamist.
The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the formation of a team led by police officers, to investigate the killing of Mehsud. It has also unfrozen Anwar's bank accounts to ensure his children do not struggle financially, Dawn said.
Since Mehsud's killing, the issue of ""police encounters"", a euphemism for extra-judicial killings, has gained media coverage amid growing anger from the Pashtun community, which says its young men are unfairly and disproportionately targeted.
Police data from 2011 reviewed by Reuters shows that at least 450 people have been killed in 200 clashes with police that involved weapons, during the seven years Anwar has been in charge of Karachi’s Malir district. 
The data does not detail the circumstances of the shootings, but the district has a large Pashtun population. 
In January, Anwar told Reuters he had done nothing wrong, saying the investigation into his officers’ actions could allow the Pakistani Taliban militants to regain a foothold in ethnic Pashtun parts of Karachi.
""I had no knowledge of Naqibullah Mehsud,"" Anwar said at the time. ""My staff told me that he is a militant with a criminal history.""

MWENE DITU, Democratic Republic of Congo, March 21 (Reuters) - The guns have fallen silent in the Congolese town of Mwene Ditu, but each day starving children arrive at the small hospital there battling for their lives.
Justine Musau, pregnant with her second child, fled into the forest in the central Kasai region last year after militiamen arrived in her nearby village and started decapitating residents they accused of collaborating with government forces.
""We didn't know who had gone where,"" she said, holding her four-year-old daughter close to her chest. Nourished only by the occasional serving of cassava, her two children had fallen ill from the lack of nutrients, she said. 
""We went to sleep famished for three or four days at a time. We didn't have pots or pans to prepare (food) so we had practically nothing to eat.""
Fighting between the army and the Kamuina Nsapu militia went on for about a year in the generally peaceful region's worst outbreak of violence in decades. As many as 5,000 people were killed and an estimated 1.5 million forced from their homes. 
Hostilities broke out in August 2016 when Congolese forces killed local chief Jean-Pierre Mpandi, who had demanded their withdrawal from Kasai.
Both sides committed atrocities, according to witness testimonies gathered by Reuters and the United Nations. 
Security forces gunned down women and children in door-to-door raids and militiamen burned down houses and cut off alleged government sympathizers' heads, feeding the blood to their young fighters as part of gruesome initiation rituals. 
The deployment of more government troops into Kasai has largely put a stop to the violence, and hundreds of thousands of civilians are now returning home. 
But as they do, hunger and disease are eclipsing guns and machetes as the region's most prolific killers. 
About 400,000 children in Kasai suffer from severe acute malnutrition, roughly the same number as in civil war-ravaged Yemen, according to the United Nations children's agency (UNICEF). 
Only 13 percent receive medical attention ""because there is not enough financing or attention,"" said Christophe Boulierac, a UNICEF spokesman. 
While a cholera epidemic that has already killed more than 100 people also rages, the fields that grow the cassava and maize the population depends on to survive lie barren from months of neglect.
COMBUSTIBLE MIX
The crisis in Kasai is one of several gripping Congo, where President Joseph Kabila's refusal to step down when his mandate expired in December 2016 inflamed a combustible mix of ethnic grievances and competition over land and mineral resources that has fuelled years of conflict.
In all, over 13 million Congolese need humanitarian aid, twice as many as last year, and 7.7 million face severe food insecurity, up 30 percent from a year ago, the U.N. said in a report this month.
Aid groups say they have only a fraction of the $1.7 billion they need this year, so many of those returning home hungry and destitute find they are left to fend for themselves.
""After a month in the forest, we heard people cry out, 'Leave the bush, the Kamuina Nsapu have left,'"" recalled Justine Mulanaga, who had come to the hospital with her two young grandchildren. 
""We left the forest to return to the village but everything was destroyed,"" she said. ""We didn't even find a glass or a plate.""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Monsignor Dario Vigano, the Italian head of the Vatican communications department who was caught up in the so-called ""Lettergate"" scandal, has resigned, the Vatican said on Wednesday.
A brief Vatican statement said Pope Francis had ""accepted"" Vigano's resignation but a Vatican source said the prelate had been told to offer it, meaning he was fired.
Vigano, 55, whose formal title was Prefect of the Secretariat for Communication, had come under sharp criticism for blurring part of a photograph of a letter by former Pope Benedict and citing it selectively for a week before releasing the entire text on Saturday.
The episode cast a shadow over the Vatican and was a public relations fiasco, particularly because earlier this year, the pope wrote a document on the dangers of ""fake news"".

The letter was meant to remain confidential but Vigano read selected passages of it at the presentation on March 12 of a Vatican-published 11-booklet series on the theology of Pope Francis.

753,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 07:17AM ET</span>",Special Report: This man is trying to rebuild Mosul. He needs help - lots of it,"By Raya Jalabi and Michael Georgy
MOSUL, Iraq (Reuters) - Perched atop a mound of rubble, Abdelsattar al-Hibbu surveyed what remained of his second-floor office: twisted iron and centuries-old stone reduced to dust by an airstrike.
""I used to look out at the river from my window,"" Hibbu said wistfully, recalling how the nine-month battle that defeated Islamic State militants in Mosul last year destroyed tens of thousands of buildings. ""Now look at it.""
Hibbu is the municipality chief of Mosul and faces the titanic task of rebuilding Iraq's second largest city from the ruins of war. It is a mega-project that could take years and require billions of dollars – yet his administration is strapped for cash.
""What are we supposed to do, dig money out of the ground?"" asked Hibbu, a tall, broad man in his mid-forties who is fond of recounting his city's storied past as a center of culture and learning.
His daily struggles reflect the challenges facing a city seen as vital to efforts to stabilize Iraq. Once home to about two million inhabitants, Mosul now has an estimated 700,000 of its population displaced and needs at least $2 billion of reconstruction, according to federal government estimates. Before the war it had an administrative budget of $80 million a year; now it doesn't know how to pay its bills.
In mid-January Hibbu told Reuters he didn't have a budget for 2018 yet, but that the city needed $75 million just to maintain basic services. He thought he might get $10 million from the Ministry of the Municipalities and Public Works, a federal government agency in Baghdad that oversees municipal governments. Nor is he expecting much from the provincial government, which once provided Mosul with about $60 million a year. It's in disarray after the governor was suspended in an investigation into alleged corruption and the torturing of journalists. The governor denies any wrongdoing.
What scares Hibbu and Western officials is that the devastation and lack of help may reignite old sectarian grievances.
Mosul's predominantly Sunni population had for years complained they were marginalized by the Shi'ite-led central government, treated like second class citizens and deprived of decent jobs and senior positions in the security forces. Those resentments led many of Mosul's Sunnis to welcome Islamic State when it captured the city in 2014 and called for war against Iraq's majority Shi'ites.
Hibbu, a Sunni himself, wants to avoid conditions that could enable a new group of militants to exploit frustration with the central government and pose another security threat.
""If Baghdad doesn't properly invest in the reconstruction of Mosul, we could get something worse"" than Islamic State, said Hibbu. ""This lack of foresight is going to have very negative consequences.""
Lise Grande, until recently the U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq who oversaw the U.N.'s stabilization program tasked with servicing immediate humanitarian needs, takes a similar view. ""If we don't stabilize these areas quickly, violent extremism might emerge again, and the gains against ISIL (Islamic State) could be lost,"" she told Reuters.
The Baghdad government did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the reconstruction of Mosul and the festering tensions.
For Hibbu, it's an uphill struggle. People show up at his office at all hours making endless demands. State employees who have not been paid in months. City workers who need more vehicles to clear the garbage that is piling up. Factory officials desperate for fuel. Even a shepherd seeking help to transport his animals through the city center.
Many people in the city feel abandoned. Some areas are dotted with dirt-covered women and children, scouring the rubble for scrap metal they can sell. At one rubbish dump in December, an elderly woman rooted through a pile of fetid garbage for anything salvageable. ""At least under Daesh"" - an Arabic acronym for Islamic State - ""we were treated better and weren't reduced to picking garbage,"" she said.
DESERTED BAZAARS
Hibbu portrays himself as a wheeler-dealer who can handle just about anything after a career as a municipality official that began 17 years ago under Saddam Hussein. During the subsequent al-Qaeda insurgency, local officials, including him, were targeted. Hibbu faced three assassination attempts and still feels pain from the wounds. Two bullets are still lodged in his lower back, he said.
He works an average of 18 hours a day, often sleeping on a mattress he keeps in his office, and the stress sometimes gets to him. One moment he has guests in his office and charms them over glasses of sweet tea, the next he yells down the telephone at employees or argues with people lobbying for help.
The Tigris River, which flows through the city, is a demarcation line in the task of reconstruction. To the east, which escaped the worst of the fighting, much of life has returned to normal: Markets are busy, classrooms are full and traffic is constant.
The picture is much bleaker to the west, where militants drew the advancing forces into door-to-door combat in the Old City, a warren of narrow streets dating back centuries. Officials estimate that 40,000 homes were destroyed in West Mosul. Civilian life has only just begun to trickle in once more.
According to Hibbu, of the 200,000 residents of the Old City, only 1,000 families have returned – or roughly 5,000 people. Many of those displaced are still living in refugee camps or have piled into East Mosul, putting additional strain on already stretched infrastructure.
The United Nations estimates there are 10 million tons of rubble in Mosul overall, and the Old City's streets are still knee-deep with debris. Children's clothes, university textbooks and human remains are scattered between mangled doorways and sheets of corrugated iron, the detritus of life in a city half-destroyed.
Taller buildings, home to snipers and makeshift bomb factories during the battle, are heaps of collapsed concrete. The bazaars have been turned inside out, their scorched or dust-coated contents strewn outside pummeled shops that once sold everything from CDs to saffron and second-hand clocks.
Massive cranes are perched in the main square, clearing rubble and bullet-pocked cars, and knocking down unstable structures. Men sweep dust and pick up trash.
""Every month we advance about 100 meters into the Old City,"" Hibbu said of rubble-clearing efforts there, walking through the bazaars one morning in mid-January. ""It's slow going, but that's all we can do with the resources we have right now.""
To help places such as Mosul, the Baghdad government set up a body called ReFAATO – The Reconstruction Fund for Areas Affected by Terroristic Operations. Fadhel Abdel Amir, an adviser to the Ministry of Municipalities, which is a partner in ReFAATO, said the fund was allocated $400 million last year in the federal budget. But only $120 million was actually transferred to the fund - and that money was for all liberated areas of Iraq, not just Mosul, Abdel Amir said.
According to Hibbu, Mosul received the equivalent of just $252,000 from ReFAATO for 2017. ""That's about what we need to spend every hour,"" Hibbu said, frustrated. ""It's not fair on the people of Mosul."" The central government in Baghdad declined to comment.
Hibbu says the municipality currently has 1,500 employees but needs 10,000. Much of its machinery was stolen or destroyed by Islamic State. About 970 machines, worth some $350 million, were taken or wrecked, he says, and the city has been left with only two specialized bulldozers small enough for clearing residential side streets.
To survive, the city has been racking up debts and relying on the patience of workers. The municipality owes $7 million to contractors and workers it hired in 2017, Hibbu said. ""We're four months late paying the salaries of our laborers.""
Fuel supplies are also short. On Mosul's outskirts is a plant making asphalt vital for reconstruction. Its manager, Wafar Younis Zanoon, said the plant needs 5,000 liters of fuel per day but secures only 3,000 liters about twice a week. ""We have to close three days a week,"" he said.
It is people like Um Russil, a mother of two, who came back to her home in the Bab al Jadeed neighborhood of the Old City in October, that Hibbu needs to reassure. The municipal chief was eager to show that her street and nearby ones had been cleared of rubble. But there was no water or electricity anywhere in the neighborhood.
Um Russil asked Hibbu to speed up the delivery of basic services to her and three other families who have returned to her street. ""I'm too embarrassed to ask anything from you,"" she said as she pulled at her dirt-covered dress. ""But our lives were destroyed by Daesh … Right now, we just need running water."" Hibbu, clad in a smart suit, instructed a deputy from his 20-person entourage to look into the delay.
Some barely scratch a living as they suffer quietly in half-demolished homes. On a typical day before the war, a trader named Moayad, who declined to give his full name, used to earn $10 a day selling used jeans. Now, he says he can hardly make $1 a week.
""How am I ever going to make any money to rebuild my home?"" he asked on a cold day in mid-January. His eldest son was killed in an airstrike during the war, leaving him to take care of his son's wife and five children.
He said he had to borrow $25 from his sister just to buy a tarpaulin and some cement blocks to shelter his extended family of 13. He fears that even if aid money does arrive, it will not reach people like him.
""The best solution would be if the international donors and the coalition gave money directly to us, to residents, to rebuild our own homes and our own city,"" said Moayad. ""Because you know the second the money goes into government hands, we're never going to see a dinar.""
""NOT A WISE CHOICE""
Early this year, the central government and Mosul officials approved a plan intended to ameliorate sectarian tensions and police the city more effectively. The federal police and the powerful Shi'ite militias that have been providing security since the city's liberation on July 10 were supposed to be phased out in favor of an army unit led by Najm al-Jabouri, a popular general from a large Sunni tribe.
Iraqi and Western officials had agreed to this arrangement to help displaced Sunni civilians feel safe enough to move back to the city. The Shi'ite militias were accused throughout the war of extra-judicial killings of Sunnis suspected of backing Islamic State. However, the plan has been indefinitely delayed, according to military and government sources, due to an increase in violence across liberated areas.
Sectarian tensions are still evident in the city. In January, members of Iranian-backed Shi'ite militias and the federal police held up posters of Iranian revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in a main Mosul square.
""That was not a wise choice,"" an outraged Hibbu said. ""We gave a lot of martyrs fighting Iran during the Iran-Iraq war, and now they're putting up pictures of Khomeini!""
The challenges of creating sectarian harmony were also evident on the outskirts of Mosul. Sh'ite militiamen who stood guard along a road leading to a garbage dump said they and many other militiamen have no intention of leaving the city.
""I am just concerned with security,"" one of the men, Jameel Khodr, who was holding an AK-47, told Reuters. Like other militiamen, he was determined that the militias keep control of as much of the area as possible. ""We have enough weapons. We have machineguns. Rocket-propelled grenades.""
As Hibbu strives to bridge divisions and rebuild the city, he is under no illusions about the difficulties.
""Iraq is truthfully a divided country. The people are divided, though officially, we're not divided,"" he said as he sat in his office, pensive at the start of what he knew would be a long day. He even wondered whether Mosul and the surrounding areas should split away from Baghdad and become autonomous.

""Everyone should be helping reconstruct the liberated areas. Because in Iraq, we endured terrorists from around the world."" He listed various countries that played a part in his city's ruin, from Iran to the United States. ""They all ended up in Mosul, where the coalition waged war against them and destroyed Mosul.""

As part of the transition deal announced on Monday, Britain agreed to remain within the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) for around 20 months after Britain's exit on March 29, 2019.
In Scotland, home to Britain's richest fishing grounds, lawmakers from May's Conservative Party have pledged they will not back a final Brexit deal unless Britain leaves the Common Fisheries Policy altogether.
Fishermen blame the CFP for policies which they say will render their industry bankrupt, and will stage their protest on the river directly opposite the Westminster parliament.
""The CFP forces British fishermen to discard half the fish they catch -the approximate equivalent of 1 billion fish portions. They then have to catch and kill more just to find the ""right"" species their quota allows them to keep,"" said Alan Hastings of Fishing for Leave.

""Brexit would have allowed a change to new UK policy of limiting time at sea in return for landing all catches, so vessels catch less but land more, allowing a bright future for fish, fishermen and coastal communities.""

India is due to hold a national election in 2019 and several states will elect new assemblies this year and next.
""Abuse of social media including Facebook cannot be allowed to impact the fairness of elections,"" Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters.

Promoting a more moderate form of Islam is one of the promises made by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman under plans to modernize the deeply conservative Muslim kingdom.
The education ministry is working to ""combat extremist ideologies by reviewing school curricula and books to ensure they do not reflect the banned Muslim Brotherhood's agenda,"" Ahmed bin Mohammed al-Isa said in a statement issued on Tuesday.
It would ""ban such books from schools and universities and remove those who sympathize with the group or its ideology from their posts,"" he added.
In September, a large Saudi public university announced it would dismiss employees suspected of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, adding to concerns that the government is clamping down on its critics in academia and beyond.
Earlier this month, Crown Prince Mohammed told CBS in an interview that Saudi schools have been ""invaded"" by elements of the Muslim Brotherhood, which has been designated by Saudi Arabia as a terrorist organization along with other militant groups such as al Qaeda and Islamic State.
INTERNAL THREAT
The young crown prince has already taken some steps to loosen Saudi Arabia's ultra-strict social restrictions, scaling back the role of religious morality police, permitting public concerts and announcing plans to allow women to drive.
The ruling Al Saud family has always regarded Islamist groups as a major internal threat to its rule over a country where appeals to religious sentiment resonate deeply and an al Qaeda campaign a decade ago killed hundreds.
Since the kingdom's founding, the Al Saud have enjoyed a close alliance with clerics of the ultra-conservative Wahhabi school of Islam who have espoused a political philosophy that demands obedience to the ruler.
By contrast the Brotherhood advances an active political doctrine urging revolutionary action. 
A political Islamist organization founded in Egypt nearly a century ago, the Muslim Brotherhood says it is committed to peaceful activism and reform through elections, and its adherents span the region, holding elected office in Arab countries from Tunisia to Jordan.
Brotherhood members fleeing repression in Egypt, Syria and Iraq half a century ago took shelter in Saudi Arabia, some taking up roles in the kingdom's education system and helping to establish the Sahwa or ""Awakening"" movement which agitated in the 1990s for democracy.
The Sahwa mostly fizzled, with some activists arrested and others coaxed into conformity, though admirers and its appeal lingered.

PFLUGERVILLE, Texas (Reuters) - An unemployed 23-year-old man suspected of a three-week bombing campaign in Texas that killed two people and injured five others before blowing himself up on the side of a highway was identified by local media on Wednesday.
The suspect was identified as Mark Anthony Conditt of Pflugerville, Texas, according to the local CBS television affiliate and Austin American-Statesman newspaper, citing unnamed law enforcement sources. Reuters could not confirm the suspect's identity.
A series of bombings beginning on March 2 left Austin, a fast-growing city of 1 million people, on edge as the bomber moved from parcels left on doorsteps to one activated by a trip wire to at least two sent via FedEx.
By Sunday, bewildered investigators had publicly asked the serial bomber to reach out to them. By Tuesday they had identified a suspect, Texas Governor Greg Abbott told Fox News.
Police tracked him to a hotel about 20 miles (32 km) north of Austin and were following his vehicle when he pulled to the side of the road and detonated a device, killing himself, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley told reporters near the scene.
""The suspect is deceased and has significant injuries from a blast that occurred from detonating a bomb inside his vehicle,"" Manley told reporters. He declined to further identify the suspect, except to say he was white.
Law enforcement officials did not respond to calls seeking to confirm the suspect's name.
""We've known for a couple of days who the suspect likely was,"" Abbott told Fox. ""Law enforcement is at his house in Pflugerville where we are learning whether or not that was the location he was making his bombs.""
The governor added that the suspect is believed to have lived with two roommates, who are not currently considered suspects, and was not a military veteran.
Public records showed that Conditt lived with his parents, William and Danene Conditt, until 2017, when he moved into a house about a mile (1.6 km) away.
In 2013 Danene Conditt posted a photo of a man she referred to as Mark on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and said she home schooled her children.
""I officially graduated Mark from High School on Friday. 1 down, 3 to go. He has 30 hrs of college credit too, but he's thinking of taking some time to figure out what he wants to do ... maybe a mission trip,"" she said in the photo caption.
Law enforcement swarmed the Conditt's neighborhood on Wednesday.
Jay Schulze, a 42-year-old network engineer, said he lived a few houses away from the bombing suspect, who with his friends would relax late at night. 
""They would be out in back playing music and partying pretty late,"" Schulze said. 
While jogging on Tuesday night, Schulze noticed a heavy police presence in the area, with drones flying overhead. He said he was stopped briefly by a person who he thought was an FBI agent.
'DO NOT UNDERSTAND' MOTIVATION 
Manley said the suspect was believed to be responsible for six bombs around Austin and in Schertz, near San Antonio, all but one of which detonated. He said the motivation for the bombings or whether the suspect had help was not yet known.
Manley warned residents to be cautious since it was not clear whether any more bombs had been left around the city.
U.S. President Donald Trump congratulated authorities on Twitter: ""Great job by law enforcement and all concerned!""
The first three devices were parcel bombs dropped off in front of homes in the Austin area. A fourth went off on Sunday night, apparently detonated with a trip wire also around Austin, and a fifth exploded inside a FedEx Corp (N:FDX) facility in Schertz on Tuesday.
FedEx officials provided ""key evidence"" that led to the suspect's identification, the company told employees in an internal memo seen by Reuters on Wednesday. [nL1N1R310Z]

The first two bombs killed black men, raising fears they were part of a hate crime, but investigators said the blasts that came later and were more random made that less likely.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Wednesday that a decision by the British ambassador to skip a Russian briefing on the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Britain showed London was unwilling to listen to Moscow's side of the story. 
The nerve agent attack in England has plunged ties between London and Moscow into their worst crisis since the Cold War. Britain has blamed Russia for the attack, something Moscow denies, and both have expelled diplomats in the standoff. 
A British embassy spokesman said on Wednesday that the UK ambassador, Laurie Bristow, would not attend the briefing with arms controls experts at the Russian Foreign Ministry, but that London was considering sending someone else.
""It's another vivid example of the absurd situation when questions are asked and an unwillingness to hear even any answers is demonstrated,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call.
Russia, which has so far refused to explain how Novichok, a nerve agent first developed by the Soviet military, was used to strike down Skripal, had invited foreign ambassadors to attend the briefing later on Wednesday to discuss the case.
It was unclear who, if anyone, Britain would send. 
""The ambassador will not attend and we are considering whether to send a representative at working level,"" a British embassy spokesman said.
Russian news agencies reported that other ambassadors, including that of the United States and France, would not attend either. 
Speaking on a visit to Japan, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said earlier on Wednesday that Russia wanted Britain to tell it where Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were currently located.
Lavrov said Moscow also wanted to know why the British government had accused Russia of responsibility when the police investigation into the Salisbury incident was incomplete.
""Overall there is no doubt that the current British leadership has consciously taken a course to undermine Russian-British relations,"" Lavrov said at a news conference with his Japanese counterpart Taro Kono in Tokyo, according to a transcript on the Russian foreign ministry website.

""If this will continue in the form of any tangible new anti-Russian actions then of course nobody has canceled the principle of reciprocity. It would be good for everyone and for (the British government) if they stopped getting agitated and calmed down.""

Labor unions said last week they would launch rolling strikes in early April, but France's transport minister said many were planning to join a wider day of public service protests on Thursday, reducing rail services by 50 percent.
""There will ultimately be serious disruption tomorrow,"" Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne said.
Unions are on a collision course with the government over its plans for the biggest shake-up of SNCF (Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer) since the nationalization of the railways in the 1930s. Among the government's plans are the trimming of benefits received by SNCF's 260,000 employees and a cut in its 45 billion euro ($56 billion) debt.
The showdown was due to start with strikes two days a week over three months from April 3. It is shaping up as the biggest test of Emmanuel Macron's presidency since the 40-year-old came to power last May on a promise of sweeping economic reforms. 
Thursday's stoppages are not part of the programed rolling strikes. They are being organized to dovetail with a day of demonstrations by civil servants and public service employees opposed to plans to change the retirement system. 

Minister Borne said the stoppages would halve regional rail services nationally and that high-speed TGV connections between major cities would be cut to 40 percent of normal levels.

The newspaper said Berlusconi, leader of the Forza Italia party, told the head of his main center-right ally, the League's Matteo Salvini, of his position during a meeting on Tuesday.
It quoted Berlusconi as saying during a meeting that he did not have any ""preclusion"" towards 5-Star.
Berlusconi told Salvini that the center-right could form a government with a specific, pre-determined agenda to tackle issues such as the economy, labor, security, and immigration, the newspaper said, without citing specific sources.
The March 4 election ended in a hung parliament, with a rightist coalition winning a combined 37 percent of the vote and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement emerging as by far the largest single party in parliament on 32 percent.
La Repubblica said Berlusconi's strategy was to put the ball into 5-Star's court so that they would have to assume responsibility if no government were formed.
Berlusconi and his center-right allies, which also include the smaller Brothers of Italy party, were due to meet in Rome later on Wednesday.
The League took some 17 percent of the overall vote, compared to 14 percent for Berlusconi's Forza Italia, putting the League in the driver's seat of the center right.
The solution feared most by markets is a marriage between 5-Star and the League, excluding Forza Italia, which is seen a moderating, pro-European force.
The League and 5-Star on their own would have a parliamentary majority and there are some overlaps in their manifestos, with both calling for tax cuts, greater spending on welfare and a rejection of EU budget rules.
Both used to call for Italy to quit the euro, but while 5-Star says the moment has passed, the League says it still wants to leave the single currency at the earliest politically feasible time.
Salvini last year said he was open to hooking up with 5-Star, but has since said he will not abandon his rightist bloc.

President Sergio Mattarella is due to start his consultations with party leaders early next month.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch voters were on track to narrowly reject a nonbinding referendum granting spy agencies the power to install bulk taps on Internet traffic.
With 83 percent of the vote counted in the early hours of Thursday, the ""no"" vote was 48.9 percent, against 47.2 percent ""yes.""
An exit poll by national broadcaster NOS had showed the yes camp narrowly winning.
Though the referendum is nonbinding, Prime Minister Mark Rutte had vowed to take the result seriously, without committing to abide by the result.
The tapping law has already been approved by both houses of parliament.
Dubbed the ""trawling law"" by opponents, the legislation will let spy agencies install taps targeting an entire geographic region or avenue of communication, store information for up to three years, and share it with allied spy agencies.
Digital rights group Bits of Freedom, which had advised a ""No"" vote, said the law is not all bad, given that taps must be approved beforehand by an independent panel. 
But the group said it still fears privacy violations and urged that the law be reconsidered.
Before the vote, Rutte said the law was needed to prevent terrorist attacks.

""It's not that our country is unsafe, it's that this law will make it safer,"" he said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore passed a law on Wednesday making it possible to ban photographs or videos of terror attack sites or communicating information about security operations amid criticism from rights groups that the move could curb press freedoms. 
The wealthy city-state ranks as one of the safest countries in the world, but authorities say it has been a target of Islamic extremists since the 1990s and they have stepped up efforts to deter an attack.
The bill, proposed last month, includes provisions to ban anyone from taking videos or photographs of the area of a terror attack or transmitting them.
It can also ban communication of text or audio messages about the security operations in the area. The measures can be taken under a ""communications stop"" order if approved by the home affairs minister and activated by the police commissioner.
""The CSO (communications stop order) is not an information blackout throughout the terror incident,"" Josephine Teo, minister in the Prime Minister's Office, told parliament ahead of the vote. 
Information leaks to terrorists could risk the lives of security officers and those caught up in an attack, the home affairs ministry has said, citing media coverage of police operations in a 2015 attack in Paris and a 2008 attack in India's financial capital of Mumbai.
Groups that advocate press freedom have expressed concern that the law gives the government the power to restrict what can be reported.
Human Rights Watch separately said the inclusion of public protests as an example of a ""serious incident"" meant the law can be used to infringe on freedom of speech.
Anyone planning a public protest is required to obtain a police permit in Singapore and are only allowed at a designated area in a small downtown park. Only Singaporean citizens and permanent residents can participate. 
“The Singaporean government’s history of persecuting dissenting voices makes the proposed public order law particularly frightening,” Asia director at Human Rights Watch Brad Adams said in a press release last week. 
""Public protests are not a threat that justify the wholesale repeal of basic rights.""
Breaches of the new measures could lead to a maximum fine of S$20,000 ($15,200) and prison terms of up to two years.
The passage of the security law comes as Singapore holds a landmark public hearing on how to tackle the threat of fake news.

DAPCHI, Nigeria (Reuters) - Islamist militants freed scores of kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls on Wednesday, but some of the released students said five of their friends had died in captivity and another was still being held.
The fighters from the Boko Haram group, some of then shouting 'God is greatest', drove the girls back into the northeast town of Dapchi in a line of trucks in the morning, dropped them off then left, witnesses told Reuters.
""Five among us taken away were dead. One is still with them because she is a Christian,"" one of the freed girls, Khadija Grema, told Reuters.
Dapchi resident Muhammad Bursari said his niece Hadiza Muhammed, another of the freed girls, told him the remaining student was still in captivity because she had refused to convert to Islam.
Witnesses said more than 100 of the 110 girls seized in Dapchi on Feb. 19 were returned, though the government issued a statement saying 76 girls had been freed in an ""ongoing process"".
Nigeria had secured the release ""through back-channel efforts and with the help of some friends of the country,"" Lai Mohammed, minister of information, said in a statement, without elaborating.
""For the release to work, the government had a clear understanding that violence and confrontation would not be the way out as it could endanger the lives of the girls, hence a non-violent approach was the preferred option,"" he said.
""I FOUND MY DAUGHTER And LEFT""
The kidnapping of the girls aged 11-19 was the biggest mass abduction since Boko Haram took more than 270 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok in 2014 - a case that triggered international outrage.
There were no immediate details from the government or from Boko Haram on why the girls were taken. Commentators feared the Dapchi girls had been taken for ransom, after Boko Haram received millions of euros for the release of some of the Chibok girls last year.
The Dapchi abduction has piled pressure on President Muhammadu Buhari, who came to power in 2015 promising to crack down on Boko Haram's nine-year-old insurgency and could face the voters again next year.
Mohammed Dala said he had found his 12-year-old daughter in a crowd of the girls in the center of town.
""Some motors painted in military color came with our girls,"" he told Reuters. ""They (the militants) ... said we should not flee. They dropped the girls at the center of town, near Ali's tea shop. I found my daughter and left.""

Most of the other girls were taken to a hospital guarded by the military, witnesses said.

KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber blew himself up near a Shi'ite shrine in Kabul on Wednesday, killing at least 29 people and wounding dozens, officials said, as the Afghan capital celebrated the Nawruz holiday marking the start of the Persian new year.
The explosion underlined the threat to the city from militant attacks, despite government promises to tighten security in the wake of an attack in January that killed around 100 people.
Militant group Islamic State, which has claimed several previous attacks on Shi'ite targets, claimed responsibility, its Amaq news agency said. The Taliban issued a statement denying any connection. 
Kabul had been on alert for attacks over the Nawruz holiday but the bomber was still able to detonate his explosives as people were leaving the Kart-e Sakhi shrine, in a heavily Shi'ite area in the west of the city.
""When the explosion took place, I fell to the ground and I saw many people on the ground around me,"" said Ramazan, who was wounded in the blast at the shrine, near the city's main university.
Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danesh said the bomber had apparently intended to reach the shrine, which was attacked during a Shi'ite festival in October 2016, but had been prevented from getting closer by police checkpoints.
""We had our security in place in and around the shrine,"" he said. ""All the casualties were young people who were either passing by on the road or gathering to enjoy Nawruz.""
Dr Waheed Majroh, a spokesman for the ministry of public health, said 29 people were confirmed dead with 52 wounded being treated in hospitals in the city. Women and children were among the casualties, he said.
Nawruz, an ancient Persian celebration of the start of spring, is widely celebrated in many parts of Afghanistan but has also faced opposition from some fundamentalist Muslims, who say it is un-Islamic.
The seemingly endless attacks have undermined support for the government of President Ashraf Ghani, who offered last month to hold peace talks with Taliban insurgents fighting to drive out international forces and reimpose their version of strict Islamic law.

The Taliban have so far shown little sign of accepting the offer of talks with the Western-backed government, which they consider an illegitimate, foreign-imposed regime, although they have offered to talk to the United States.

NANTERRE, France (Reuters) - French former president Nicolas Sarkozy was told after two days in custody on Wednesday that he is being formally treated as a suspect as magistrates investigate claims his 2007 election campaign got funding from late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.
The move made Sarkozy - who ruled from 2007 to 2012 and is still an influential behind-the-scenes player on the political right - the target of an inquiry into alleged cash handovers and wire transfers between Tripoli and Paris in the months before he won power.
It marked a dramatic acceleration in an inquiry that had largely faded in the news since it was opened five years ago, shortly after the 63-year-old left office.
Sarkozy has now been released from police custody but put under judicial supervision.
In French legal jargon, he was officially ""placed under investigation"" - a step judicial investigators can take if they have serious grounds for suspecting an offence. Being placed under investigation often but not always leads to trial.
The investigation will now focus on suspected offences that include passive corruption, illegal campaign financing and concealing the misuse of Libyan public funds, an official at the judiciary said on condition of anonymity, the standard way of communicating on such matters in France.
It is the second major investigation for Sarkozy, who also faced charges of illicit campaign spending overruns during his failed re-election bid in 2012.
The latest case concerns accusations by a Franco-Lebanese businessman, Ziad Takieddine, who says he helped funnel 5 million euros ($6 million) from Gaddafi's intelligence chief to Sarkozy's campaign chief ahead of the 2007 election.
Sarkozy himself has not commented publicly since he first answered a police summons for questioning on Tuesday. He has in the past dismissed the allegations as ""grotesque"" and described them as a ""manipulation"". The source in the judiciary said he had denied any wrongdoing during questioning. 
The inquiry began in 2013, after investigative website Mediapart published Takieddine's allegations.
In an interview with Lebanon's L'Orient du Jour newspaper published on Tuesday, Takieddine said he acted as an intermediary between France and Libya during the time that Sarkozy served as interior minister, before his election bid.
Five months after Sarkozy was elected president, Gaddafi visited him in Paris, on his first state visit to a Western capital in decades. The eccentric Libyan leader pitched a Bedouin-style tent near the Elysee Palace.
Later, Sarkozy became one of the chief advocates of the NATO-led campaign against Gaddafi that resulted in the dictator's overthrow and killing by rebels in 2011.
Sarkozy, once branded a ""bling-bling"" president because of a penchant for flashy behaviour, has been dogged for years by political scandals, but none has led to a conviction.
He is not the first French president to be questioned by police after leaving office.

After leaving office, his predecessor, Jacques Chirac, was convicted in 2011 of misusing public funds to maintain political friends in phantom jobs - making him the first French head of state to be convicted of a crime since Nazi collaborator Marshall Philippe Petain in 1945.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China is consolidating film, news and publishing regulation under the powerful Communist Party publicity department, strengthening Beijing's grip over content, according to a document reviewed by Reuters and a source with direct knowledge of the matter.
The shift comes as China looks to merge ministries and create new regulators overseeing matters from banking to food safety, in the biggest government shake-up in years. 
China, under President Xi Jinping, has been cracking down on news, online content and film that goes against Party values.
The reorganization would mean the publicity department would play a ""special and important role in propaganda ideology and cultural entertainment"" said the notice from the ruling Party's Central Committee and dated March 19.
The publicity department did not immediately reply to a faxed request for comment and could not be reached by phone.
The body will take on powers over film, news and publishing, previously held by the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, which was dissolved earlier this month as part of the wider reshuffle.
In addition, China has also approved the creation of new broadcaster called ""Voice of China,"" which will consolidate several existing state TV and radio stations, the document said.
The newly created broadcaster will be directed by the publicity department.

772,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 07:38AM ET</span>",Reuters reporters in court 100 days after their arrest in Myanmar,"By Simon Lewis and Sam Aung Moon
YANGON (Reuters) - Two Reuters reporters appeared in a Myanmar court for the 11th time on Wednesday, which marked 100 days since they were arrested in December and accused of possessing secret government papers.
The court in Yangon is holding preliminary hearings to decide whether reporters Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 28, will face charges under the colonial-era Officials Secrets Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.
""We have spent 100 days in prison,"" Wa Lone told reporters during a break in proceedings. ""Our journalism spirit was never down even after spending many days in there.""
Wa Lone's younger brother Thura Aung, 26, gave testimony on Wednesday, describing a police search of the family home on the evening of Dec. 13, the day after the journalists were arrested.
Thura Aung said that police who searched the house in north Yangon did not show a warrant, identify themselves or explain the reason for the search, during which a laptop, charger and bag, a hard drive and an old notebook were seized.
His testimony contradicted Police Major Soe Aung, who told the court two weeks ago that police had presented a warrant to Wa Lone's family when they arrived.
Defence lawyer Than Zaw Aung told reporters after the hearing that under Myanmar's Criminal Procedure Code police must identify themselves and explain the reasons for their search.
""In the criminal procedure, the search officer must show the search warrant at the search place,"" he said.
Lead prosecutor Kyaw Min Aung left the court building before Reuters was able to put questions to him after the hearing. At previous hearings he has declined to speak to reporters.
Government and police spokespeople have declined to comment on the case, citing the ongoing court proceedings. The date of the next hearing was set for March 28.
RESTAURANT MEETING
The journalists have told relatives they were arrested almost immediately after being handed some rolled up papers after being invited to a restaurant by two police officers they had not met before.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo had been investigating the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men in a village in western Myanmar's Rakhine state during a military crackdown in August.
The crackdown, which the United Nations has said was ethnic cleansing, has sent nearly 700,000 people fleeing to Bangladesh. 
After the arrests of the reporters, the military admitted its soldiers took part in the killing.
""They have been detained in Myanmar since December 12 simply for doing their jobs as journalists,"" Reuters President and Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler said in a statement.
""Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo are exemplary individuals and outstanding reporters who are dedicated to their families and their craft. They should be in the newsroom, not in prison.""
Myanmar's ambassador to the United Nations, Hau Do Suan, said last month that the journalists were not arrested for reporting a story, but were accused of ""illegally possessing confidential government documents"".
Judge Ye Lwin declined a defense attempt to submit the Reuters report describing the killings at the village of Inn Din as evidence, citing a decision at an earlier hearing not to admit the story at this stage in the proceedings.
Senior United Nations officials, Western nations and press freedom advocates have called for the release of the journalists.
The U.S. Embassy in Yangon tweeted: ""Today is the 100th day in detention from reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo. Freedom of the press remains critical for Myanmar's democratic transition.""
Diplomats from countries including the United States, Canada, Sweden attended Wednesday's hearing.
The Danish embassy, which has closely monitored the case, said the pair had spent ""100 days behind bars for ensuring the public's right to information"".
A statement from Sweden's embassy said: ""We believe they have done nothing wrong and that the charges against them should be dropped immediately.""
EU Ambassador to Myanmar Kristian Schmidt, asked about the journalists' reporting of the Rakhine crisis, said it was imperative to establish what had taken place there.

""We all want to find out the truth of what happened,"" he said. ""I fear for the moment we have not seen the full truth of what has happened.""

According to the country's constitution, the more senior of two vice presidents will stand in as president until a new leader is elected by parliament within seven working days. 
This means that Myint Swe, who was the military's appointment for vice-president, will become acting president. 
The president is the head of state and government in Myanmar, and under the constitution has far-reaching powers. However, Htin Kyaw's role was more ceremonial because Aung San Suu Kyi has been Myanmar's de facto leader since April 2016.
A constitution drafted by the former junta bars Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi from the top office and so she hand-picked Htin Kyaw, a close ally of hers, to become president.
Aung Shin, a spokesman for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party, said that Htin Kyaw, 71, had stepped down due to ill-health.
The president's office did not give a reason for Htin Kyaw's resignation. In its posting, the president's office said that, according to the constitution, steps would be taken to replace him within seven working days.
""The next president will be an NLD member or one who suits with NLD policy,"" Aung Shin said. ""The current vice-president cannot be the next president, according to the constitution.""

775,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 01:58AM ET</span>",Chinese rights activists fearful as policeman takes charge of legal affairs,"By Christian Shepherd
BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese rights lawyers and activists say the promotion on Monday of former police official Fu Zhenghua to head China's justice ministry signals an even deeper freeze on attempts to use the country's legal system to defend against rights abuses.
Lawmakers at China's annual meeting of parliament rubber-stamped the appointment of Fu, previously a deputy head of China's ministry of public security, to take charge of the department in charge of maintaining and improving China's legal system. Fu was preceded by Zhang Jun, who is now head of the state prosecutor and courts.
Long seen as a rising star in law enforcement, Fu led a number of high-profile investigations and crackdowns, including the probe into former security czar Zhou Yongkang, who was found guilty of corruption. 
Since 2015, he headed an office dedicated to the suppression of what the ruling Communist Party calls ""evil cults"", including the banned spiritual movement Falun Gong.
Fu's self-described ""heavy fist"" approach to law enforcement has won him plaudits from Chinese state media, which has previously said his campaigns helped clean up Chinese society and tackle graft.
Rights groups have called for the United States to target Fu with sanctions under the Magnitsky Act, which authorizes the U.S. government to freeze assets of those responsible for gross human rights violations.
A coalition of 23 groups coordinated by Washington-based Human Rights First asked the United States to impose sanctions against Fu and two other police officers for their role in overseeing the detention of activist Cao Shunli, who died in custody in 2013.
""Fu Zhenghua has presided over a number of serious human rights violations throughout his career,"" said Frances Eve, a Hong Kong-based researcher for Chinese Human Rights Defenders.
""Fu's appointment is a sign that the Xi Jinping regime is not going to back down on its suppression of human rights.""
Neither China's justice department or public security ministry responded to faxed requests for comment about rights activists concerns and complaints over Fu’s appointment. 
China regularly rejects foreign criticism of its human rights record, saying that its people are best placed to judge the rights situation in China and that the country is governed by law.
The United States imposed sanctions on one officer, Gao Yan, in December last year. Gao had been in charge at Chaoyang Detention Centre in Beijing where a Chinese rights activist, Cao Shunli, was held and questioned prior to her death in hospital under police custody in March 2014. 
Rights groups say Cao was tortured and denied medical care. Gao could not be reached for comment. 
China said that the United States should not be a ""human rights judge"", after the sanctions against Gao were announced.
CLAMPDOWN ON DISSENT
President Xi Jinping has overseen clampdown on all forms of dissent in Chinese society, which has seen hundreds of rights lawyers and activists detained and dozens jailed.
The announcement last month that China would scrap presidential term limits, which was approved by parliament last week, was met with despair by many of China's rights activists who were holding out hope that the tightening was temporary.
Rights groups say that the justice department has increasingly disbarred lawyers who challenged official abuses of power, after rules for law firms and lawyers were revised in 2016 to require greater political loyalty.
At least six lawyers have been disbarred in the last six months, according to Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a practice that was previously less common. Reuters has confirmed four of the disbarments. 
The government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the disbarments.
Dozens of people, including rights lawyers and their family members and supporters, took to social media after Fu's promotion was announced to make sarcastic comments about his new role being a boon for the rule of law in China.
Fu’s moving from law-enforcement to being in charge of legal affairs at least means he would no longer be in charge of arrests, only disbarments, Wang Qiaoling, the wife of prominent rights Lawyer Li Heping, joked on the messaging platform WeChat.
""He has in the past arrested my husband, made him disappear, tortured him... Now he can only revoke or cancel his license and invite him for talks,"" she said.
Li was handed a three year suspended jail sentence for subversion in 2017.
The government declined to comment about the sarcastic reaction Fu's promotion has triggered.

776,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 03:06AM ET</span>",China stays on the sidelines as Venezuela spirals downward,"By Corina Pons and Chen Aizhu
CARACAS/BEIJING (Reuters) - China is likely to extend an agreement providing crisis-stricken Venezuela with favorable loans repayment terms but will not lend fresh funds to President Nicolas Maduro's government, according to sources in Caracas and Beijing familiar with the situation. 
During a decade, China plowed more than $50 billion into the OPEC member's coffers through oil-for-loan agreements that helped Beijing secure energy supplies for its fast-growing economy while bolstering an anti-Washington ally in Latin America. 
But the flow of cash halted nearly three years ago when Venezuela asked for a change of payment terms when a fall in oil prices and declining crude output pushed its state-led economy into a hyperinflationary collapse. 
Though unwilling to throw Venezuela a financial lifeline, the state-run China Development Bank (CDB) will likely extend next month a grace period begun in 2016 that allows Venezuela to make only interest payments on its loans, the sources said.
However, China has ignored several requests for new funding.
""Given Venezuela's falling oil production, it's natural for Chinese banks not to renew loans,"" said one Chinese oil industry source who asked not to be identified. 
A second oil industry source, asked if the conditions would be tightened, cited a Chinese proverb, saying China would not ""drop stones on somebody who has fallen into a well.""
Venezuela still owes China $19.3 billion, according to one Venezuelan finance industry source who has tracked the information via contacts in both countries.
Some $10.4 billion of that is owed under the $20 billion Large Volume Long Term fund signed in 2010. A further $8.4 billion remains outstanding under the Joint China Venezuela Fund via three tranches of $4 billion to $5 billion each, according to the source.
China's policy is not to lend new funds until old loans have been paid off - which cannot happen under the interest-only scheme created in April 2016 because the outstanding balance does not change. 
CDB President Zheng Zhijie, asked by Reuters if the bank was having second thoughts about financing Venezuela given its situation, said: ""We've done our assessment of its political and economic situation. We're just monitoring now.""
However, one Beijing-based diplomatic source familiar with Chinese thinking on Venezuela said China increasingly sees Maduro as similar to former Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, who was pushed out after 40 years in power that dragged his once-prosperous country into hyperinflation and economic crisis.
China would have no concern about abandoning Maduro as it did Mugabe when he was ousted, the source said, but does not expect China to take an active role in pushing him out.
""China looks at Venezuela as another Zimbabwe: a poor return on its investment,"" he said.
CHINA EYES 'PRAGMATIC COOPERATION'
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not reply to a request for comment.
China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that bilateral cooperation was proceeding smoothly at present, adding that: ""China will continue to carry out pragmatic cooperation with Venezuela.""
Prominent Chinese ratings agency Dagong Global Credit Rating Co in November put Venezuela's sovereign debt on negative watch in a scathing review that warned of high default risks on bonds, which are not linked to financing arrangements with Beijing.
""Venezuela lacks the ability to create wealth on its own while debt repayment sources are highly fragile, thus a low solvency,"" Dagong wrote.
Sanctions levied by the government of U.S. President Donald Trump have left Venezuela unable to refinance its crippling debt burden and left it struggling to import basic goods such as food.
Beijing has also declined to renew financing to state oil company PDVSA that is tied to oil industry investment, according to Venezuelan finance industry sources, in contrast to other loans that are used for a broader range of expenditures.
PDVSA in December paid off a $1.5 billion loan that it received in 2014, but was unable to renew it. The loan is paid off in cash rather than in oil, which made it less attractive, the source said.
Venezuela has in recent months proposed different arrangements under which China would put in new cash, including renewing part of the $20 billion Large Volume Fund, according to Venezuelan finance industry sources.
Those requests have been ignored, the sources said. 
But despite China's discontent, halting the grace period would have little practical benefit because it would most likely lead Caracas to get behind on payments - something it has done in the past. 
In order to enforce its claims, China would have to open a cumbersome commercial dispute and engage in an unfriendly process of forcibly collecting on the loans, embarrassing a government that it actively supported for years.
Venezuela as of last year had fallen behind on oil shipments to China as well as Russia, another ally that has been providing financing, according to internal documents seen by Reuters.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's biggest opposition party released audio and video recordings late on Tuesday in which supporters of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski appear to offer lawmakers public work projects in exchange for help defeating an impeachment motion.
In a press conference two days before Congress votes on whether to force Kuczynski from office, the spokesman of rightwing party Popular Force said the snippets of surreptitious recordings of lawmakers and a government official shown to journalists were proof Kuczynski was trying to ""buy"" votes. 
""We're outraged,"" Daniel Salaverry said, flanked by other members of his party as they renewed calls for Kuczynski to step down. 
Kuczynski's center-right government denied wrongdoing and immediately fired an official who is heard promising a lawmaker access to easy money through public work contracts if he supports Kuczynski in the impeachment vote on Thursday.
The attorney general's office said the material merited an ""exhaustive investigation.""
The scandal dealt a fresh blow to Kuczynski as he seeks to distance himself from a construction company that has acknowledged bribing officials across Latin America. 
Minutes after the recordings were broadcast at least one lawmaker backed away from supporting Kuczynski.
""I can't be part of this,"" Jorge del Castillo, an influential lawmaker who previously criticized the impeachment bid, said on local broadcaster Canal N. ""The president must give an explanation...I wouldn't be surprised if he resigns.""
Kuczynski's office did not respond to requests for comment.
Prime Minister Mercedes Araoz slammed the recordings as part of a malicious campaign to unseat Kuczynski and stressed that no minister in Kuczynski's cabinet had appeared in the recordings.
""The government does not buy lawmakers,"" Araoz told journalists, denying any government contract had been awarded in exchange for political support.
In the recordings, three lawmakers who recently broke party ranks with Popular Force are heard trying to persuade their former colleagues in the party to help keep Kuczynski from being impeached on Thursday.
The three lawmakers, who helped defeat an impeachment motion in December, describe how supporting Kuczynski will open the door to public work projects for their regions. The lead lawmaker in the group, Kenji Fujimori, is heard telling a reluctant lawmaker not to worry about public prosecutors because the government will be on his side.
Fujimori denied any wrongdoing. ""What was seen in the video is what any authority, any lawmakers, does to help get a project going,"" Fujimori told journalists in broadcast comments.
Kuczynski narrowly survived impeachment in December with the help of Fujimori and nine other dissident Popular Force lawmakers. Three days later, Kuczynski pardoned Fujimori's father, the once-jailed former autocrat Alberto Fujimori, in what many view as political payback.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel for the first time confirmed that it bombed a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor in 2007, saying on Wednesday that the strike removed a major threat to Israel and the region and was a ""message"" to others.
The first public acknowledgement by Israel that its F-16 and F-15 warplanes carried out the Sept. 6, 2007, bombing of the partially constructed Al-Kubar facility near Deir al-Zor was made after military censors lifted a more than 10-year order that had barred Israeli officials from discussing it. 
The strike had already been extensively reported on abroad, and discussed by U.S. officials. Israel, however, kept quiet to avoid provoking Syrian reprisals and a possible regional war. 
The Israeli military released newly declassified operational footage, photographs and intelligence documents about the bombing and detailing the intelligence operation that led up to it. 
Israel concluded that the reactor had been under construction with North Korean help and was months away from activation. Reuters has been unable to immediately verify the Israeli material.
Israel’s decision to go public comes after repeated calls in recent months by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the United States and international community to take tougher action on Syria’s ally, Iran.
""The motivation of our enemies has grown in recent years, but so too the might of the IDF (Israel Defence Forces),"" Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Wednesday.
""Everyone in the Middle East would do well to internalize this equation,"" he said. 
The Israeli military described in detail the events leading up to the night of Sept 5 to Sept 6, 2007, in which, it said, eight warplanes took off from the Ramon and Hatzerim air bases and flew to Deir al-Zor region, 450 km northwest of Damascus, Syria, and dropped 18 tonnes of munitions.
The operation was launched after it received intelligence indicating that ""a substantial threat to Israel and the region, in the form of a nuclear reactor, was being built in Syria"". 
U.S. BACKING
In his 2010 memoir ""Decision Points,"" former U.S. President George W. Bush disclosed that he discussed intelligence about the Syrian facility with then Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert before it was destroyed but did not give him the green light for the raid.
James Jeffrey, Bush's deputy national security adviser, said on Wednesday that the former U.S. president had been ""absolutely supportive"" of Israel.
""(He) made it clear that we were very happy that events had eliminated this threat and that if there were any threats to Israel that would emerge from this situation, the United States would stand with Israel, period,"" Jeffrey told Israel's Army Radio. 
""TOP SECRET""
The Israeli military declassified internal ""top secret"" intelligence reports, in Hebrew, some of them partly redacted.
One, dated March 30, 2007, said: ""Syria has set up, within its territory, a nuclear reactor for the production of plutonium, through North Korea, which according to an (initial) worst-case assessment is liable to be activated in approximately another year. To our assessment [REDACTED] secretive and orderly [REDACTED] for achieving a nuclear weapon.""
Israeli intelligence predicted that the suspected reactor ""would turn operational by the end of 2007"".
The mission to destroy the facility started at 10.30 p.m. on Sept. 5 and ended with safe return of the warplanes at 2.30 a.m. the next day, the Israeli military said.
As it happened, the event was first made public by Syria, which, as reported by Reuters at the time, said in the early hours of Sept. 6 that Syrian air defenses had repelled an incursion by Israeli warplanes. 
Syria, a signatory of the 1970 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), has always denied that the site was a reactor or that Damascus engaged in nuclear cooperation with North Korea.
The Israeli military announcement on Wednesday noted that the area in question, around Deir al-Zor, was captured by Islamic State after the Syrian civil war erupted in 2011.
Had there been an active reactor there, the Israeli military said, it would have had ""severe strategic implications on the entire Middle East as well as Israel and Syria"". 
The Israeli release contains a black-and-white aerial photograph captioned ""before the attack"" and showing a box-like square structure amid desert dunes with smaller outlying buildings. 
A series of black-and-white videos, taken above the target, shows the structure in cross-hairs. A male voice is heard counting down three seconds, a cloud of black smoke rises from the center of the structure as it explodes. Other footage appears to show the aftermath - a smoldering hole in the ground. 

Wednesday's release came ahead of the publication of a memoir by Olmert. One of his aides told Reuters the book would contain passages about the 2007 strike in Syria.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan has sent ships and aircraft to shadow a Chinese aircraft carrier group through the narrow Taiwan Strait, its defense ministry said on Wednesday, after Chinese President Xi Jinping offered his strongest warning against Taiwan separatism to date.
China claims Taiwan as its sacred territory and considers the self-ruled island a wayward province, which Xi said on Tuesday would face the ""punishment of history"" for any attempt at separatism.
Taiwan's defense ministry said the carrier group, led by China's sole operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, entered the waterway late on Tuesday, but kept on its western side.
By midday on Wednesday it has left Taiwan's air defense identification zone heading southwest, the ministry said, adding it looked like China was conducting drills.
Taiwan's military sent ships and aircraft to shadow the carrier group the entire way, but spotted nothing out of the ordinary and people in Taiwan should not be concerned, it added.
China's Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
In January, the Liaoning sailed twice through the Taiwan Strait, in what China said was part of routine drills. 
Taiwan says China has ramped up military exercises around the island in the past year or so. The island is one of China's most sensitive issues and a potential military flashpoint. 
China's hostility towards Taiwan has risen since the 2016 election of President Tsai Ing-wen, a member of the island's pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party.
China suspects Tsai wants to push for formal independence, which would cross a red line for Communist Party leaders in Beijing, though Tsai has said she wants to maintain the status quo and is committed to ensuring peace.
China's Taiwan Affairs Office on Monday expressed anger at Taiwan Premier William Lai's description of the island as a sovereign independent country, calling it a ""serious provocation"" and denying that Taiwan was, or could ever be, one.
China has also been infuriated by a law signed last week by U.S. President Donald Trump that encourages the United States to send senior officials to Taiwan to meet Taiwanese counterparts, and vice versa.

U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Alex Wong is in Taiwan this week, where he is set to speak at a business event in Taipei later on Wednesday with Tsai.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - When Mohammad Ayub Khan heard his nephew had been picked up by Pakistani security officials in Karachi, it brought back painful memories of another nephew who had gone missing in similar circumstances years before.
Khan, an ethnic Pashtun, says he had been calling at army and police offices seeking news of Haji Akbar since his nephew was ordered off a bus by uniformed soldiers seven years ago during a security alert in the northern Swat Valley. Then last year his second nephew, rickshaw driver Abu Ghurera, was detained by plainclothes men as he waited for a fare in the country's biggest city, according to witnesses. 
""I have knocked on every door but have not gotten any answers,"" said Khan, who blames government security agencies for both men's disappearances.
""Tell us where our children are so we know if they are alive. And if they are dead, at least return their bodies.""
Rights groups say such cases have been common for the past decade. But the simmering resentment of the Pashtun community boiled over in January, when a young Pashtun man was gunned down by police in Karachi in an incident an inquiry has since ruled to be an extrajudicial killing.
The killing, initially described by police as a shoot-out with terrorist suspects, sparked peaceful protests across the country by members of the 30 million-strong Pashtun community, who say hundreds of their young men have been ""disappeared"". 
The Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which organized the protests, has compiled a list of approximately 1,200 missing persons after speaking to families.
A preliminary list of 315 names has been seen by Reuters. Relatives of 20 of those listed were contacted and confirmed their family member was missing.
Amnesty International said on Monday that a UN working group on enforced disappearances had 700 pending cases from Pakistan and urged the authorities to do more to resolve them. 
PTM leaders say stories of Pashtun disappearances have been largely ignored until now, especially ordeals suffered by families from the tribal belt bordering Afghanistan, including thousands who moved to major cities to escape a near-decade long insurgency by Islamist militants.
The Pakistan Army's public relations department did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the military has in the past said it does not detain individuals without evidence. Pakistan's Ministry of Interior did not respond to requests for comment.
SCARED TO SPEAK OUT
Many relatives, including Khan, say they had been too scared to speak up, fearing security forces would act against them and their remaining family members.
But protest leaders say that changed with the January killing of Naqibullah Mehsud in Karachi, and the demonstrations that followed that swelled to several thousand strong.
""Naqib's blood has given the rest of us a voice,"" said Alam Zeb Khan, one of the protest organizers. 
Pashtuns say that the insurgency raging in their homeland has led security forces to treat them all as potential militants.
The killing of Mehsud, an aspiring fashion model, received nationwide attention because his widely shared social media profile, laden with pictures of him posing in fashionable clothes, cast doubt on police assertions that he was a violent Islamist.
A police committee of inquiry has since ordered the arrest of the officers responsible for his death and termed the incident an extrajudicial killing.
Meanwhile, the January protests snowballed, with demonstrators camping out in the capital Islamabad, denouncing the disappearance and extrajudicial killings of young Pashtuns.
NO TIME TO BE YOUNG
Several of the Pashtun protest organizers say they have been activists since their teens.
""We have to grow up early. It's because of the lives we are born into,"" Alam Zeb said.
Student activist Manzoor Pashteen, 26, says he has waited years for this moment. 
Last year he was organizing small 100-person protests in the northern town of Dera Ismail Khan, where he has lived since leaving conflict-ridden South Waziristan to pursue an education in 2005.
On March 15, Pakistani authorities filed a case against Pashteen for ""provocation with intent to cause riot"", carrying a maximum sentence of five years.
""I am angry because I am asking for my constitutional rights from the government,"" Pashteen told Reuters. ""And the state calls me treacherous.""
A senior police official said a case had been lodged against Pashteen over anti-state comments he made during the protests.
In 2009, the army launched an offensive against the Pakistani Taliban in South Waziristan. The war reduced entire villages to rubble and turned nearly a million people into internal refugees. 
The leadership of the Pakistani Taliban hails from the region and the group controlled large swathes of territory in both South and North Waziristan until they were pushed out by the military in separate operations in 2009 and 2014. 
The region is still affected by media restrictions limiting the ability of journalists to travel there, and activists say that has contributed to the portrayal of the Pashtun population as wedded to backward tribal customs and maintaining close ties to militant groups. 
""If your name is Mehsud and you're from South Waziristan, then immediately people associate you with militants,"" human rights lawyer Jibran Nasir said. 
MISSING WITHOUT A TRACE
Organizers say their protests have had some impact. Eight missing persons have returned in the past month, Alam Zeb told Reuters, adding they were detained by Pakistan's intelligence agencies.
""I have spoken to the families of all eight and they were with the intelligence agencies,"" he said.
Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), the main spy agency, did not respond to a request for comment.
One such case is that of Sohail Ahmed, who was taken by security officials in plainclothes in July 2016 and finally returned earlier this month. 
In another case, a man who was arrested by security forces in the northern town of Bajaur turned up in police custody 150 km (80 miles) away on charges of possessing weapons and bomb making materials. 
""He hated militants,"" Mohammad Zahid said of his cousin, Kaleemullah, whose arrest he witnessed.
Protesters say such stories are common.
Mohammad Bilal has not seen his son since he was taken by security officials eight years ago.
""He was working as a bus conductor in Karachi when the coach was stopped by security officials and Hazratullah was taken away,"" Bilal told Reuters, holding up a large picture of his son.
Bilal says he has asked police and military officials about his son, but has received no answers.

""I am alone,"" he said. ""He is my oldest son, how can I forget him.""

State television showed images this week of the unmanned tanks undergoing testing, the Global Times newspaper reported.
Footage showed a Type 59 tank being driven by remote control, in what the paper said was the first time a Chinese-made unmanned tank has been shown in a public forum. 
The Type 59 tank is based on an old Soviet model first used in China in the 1950s and has been produced in large numbers and has a long service life, it said.
""A large number of due-to-retire Type 59 tanks can be converted into unmanned vehicles if equipped with artificial intelligence,"" Liu Qingshan, the chief editor of Tank and Armoured Vehicle, told the newspaper. 
Unmanned tanks will be able to work on other unmanned equipment, integrate information from satellites, aircraft or submarines, the report added.
China is in the middle of an impressive modernization program for its armed forces, including building stealth fighters and new aircraft carriers, as President Xi Jinping looks to assert the country's growing power.

784,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 08:21PM ET</span>",A 'millennials party' dares to break Indonesia's political mould,"By Kanupriya Kapoor
JAKARTA (Reuters) - In the Jakarta headquarters of the Indonesian Solidarity Party (PSI), workers call each other ""bro"" and ""sis"", and their leader sets the sartorial standard with a pair of ripped jeans.
Dubbed the 'millennials party', the PSI is an upstart on the political stage of this Southeast Asian nation that hopes to tap into young voters' contempt for the entrenched corruption and divisive identity politics of the ruling elite.
The downfall of long-serving autocrat Suharto in 1998 - amid a crisis widely blamed on a culture of nepotism and graft - brought an end to a regime of repression. But two decades later, the 190 million voters of the world's third-largest democracy are still asked to choose from a crowd of candidates who began their political careers during that period. 
The 2019 presidential election looks set to be a repeat of 2014, when current leader Joko Widodo narrowly defeated Prabowo Subianto, an ex-armed forces general who was formerly married to a daughter of Suharto. 
The PSI is one of four new parties the General Election Commission is allowing to contest next year’s legislative and presidential elections. 
Two of the new parties are fronted by establishment figures. The United Indonesia Party (Perindo) is headed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s business partner in Indonesia, Hary Tanoeseodibjo, while the Berkaya Party is led by Suharto's youngest son, Tommy, who advocates a return to the ""New Order"" values of his late father.
PSI leader Grace Natalie, a former television journalist, believes the time has come for a new generation of politicians who would be genuinely accountable to the people.
Her party interviews members seeking nomination for a seat in parliament, and live-streams the discussions on social media platforms. Teachers, corporate lawyers, doctors and bankers are among those whose interviews have aired on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and YouTube.
""No other party is offering what we are in terms of transparency,"" she told Reuters at PSI's headquarters - referred to by party staff as ""base camp"" - where a wall poster urges ""Make Art, Not War"".
CRITICAL DEMOGRAPHIC
Natalie, a 35-year-old mother of two toddlers, set up PSI in 2014, determined to offer an alternative for young voters. It's a critical demographic with people between the ages of 17 and 25 accounting for about 30 percent of the electorate. Two-thirds of the party's roughly 400,000 members are under 35.
PSI relies on crowdfunding and donations to run operations across the vast archipelago of Indonesia, and to keep costs down it works from members' houses and uses donated vehicles.
""This way, no one person can claim that they own the party. Everyone is contributing something,"" said Natalie, who was educated in Jakarta and the Netherlands, and speaks proficient English.
So far, PSI has raised 2.6 billion rupiah ($180,000), a tiny sum compared to the coffers of mainstream parties that benefit from poor enforcement of laws limiting political donations.
It will also struggle to get traction with the youth it is targeting. 
While the size of the youth vote bank has swelled from 18 percent of total voters in 2004 to 30 percent in 2014, the participation of young voters has dwindled. 
Data from the elections commission showed less than half of voters between 17 and 29 years old cast a ballot in 2014 legislative elections compared with around 90 percent among those over 30.
Ella Prihatini, a researcher at the University of Western Australia, in a survey of 253 young voters, found many of them were uninterested in politics.
""On parliament, the dominant answer from respondents was that their MPs are not actually representing them, so why bother voting?"" Prihatini said.
POLITICAL ISLAM 
Winning support is also likely to be particularly challenging for Natalie, an ethnic-Chinese Indonesian, in a climate of religious and ethnic tensions. Indonesia is a secular country but concerns are growing about the Islamisation of politics in the world's largest Muslim-majority country. 
Jakarta's former governor, an ethnic-Chinese Christian, was ousted last year after hardline Muslim groups organized massive protests over allegations he insulted Islam. He was later jailed for blasphemy.
The 14 parties contesting next year's polls include the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), which leads the ruling coalition, several other secular parties as well as rising Islamic-oriented parties. 
Natalie, who plans to run for parliament next year, conceded she and PSI need a far bigger budget to win support in rural areas, home to nearly half of Indonesia's population. Her party will back Widodo - a popular moderate reformer - for re-election as president rather than try to field a candidate of its own.
Ibrahim Irsyad Hasibuan, a 20-year-old journalism student from Tangerang outside Jakarta, said young voters are apathetic because they have no faith in the political system, and so PSI could be a wake-up call for his generation.
""But I can't relate to PSI,"" he said. ""It is a new political party and has no track record yet.""
Achmad Sukarsono, a Singapore-based political analyst for Control Risks, was dismissive of the new party, arguing that an anti-corruption stance alone will not be enough to win over voters more interested in local and bread-and-butter issues.

""It is a nice utopian effort that shows desire for change from the educated, Westernized elite,"" he said.

785,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 08:11PM ET</span>",Syrian rebels reach evacuation deal in Eastern Ghouta town: rebel sources,"AMMAN (Reuters) - A Russian-brokered deal has been reached to evacuate a Syrian rebel group from a town in Eastern Ghouta to opposition-held northwestern Syria in the first such deal in the last remaining rebel bastion near the capital, two opposition sources said on Wednesday.
They said fighters from Ahrar al Sham rebel group in control of the besieged town of Harasta had agreed to lay down their arms in return for safe passage to insurgent-controlled areas and an offer to be pardoned under local reconciliation terms with the authorities for those who want to stay.
The Syrian army and allied forces have recaptured 70 percent of the territory that was under insurgent control in the enclave and after weeks of bombardment residents are fleeing by the thousands. 
The relentless Syrian army assault backed by Russian air power that began last month has killed hundreds of people, according to rescuers and a monitor.
The evacuation deals come after years of siege and bombardment that have been a major strategy by the Syrian army to force rebels to surrender and help Syrian President Bashar al-Assad recover all of Aleppo, Homs and other areas.
""The deal has been finalised and it could come into effect soon after a ceasefire is announced as early as Wednesday,"" said one official familiar with the talks that have been going on for several days.
It would begin with an evacuation of injured civilians, he added. 
The predicament of hundreds of rebels trapped in Harasta, one of the main towns in eastern Ghouta, worsened after the army succeeded earlier this month in splintering Ghouta into three besieged zones, cutting off Harasta from other areas.
Last Sunday, the Syrian army had given the rebels of Harasta area an ultimatum to withdraw, state media said. 
The Harasta deal will pile pressure on the two main rebel groups - Failaq al-Rahman in the southern pocket and Jaish al-Islam in the northern enclave - to also reach understandings.
They have however publicly said they reject Russia's offer to leave the enclave.
The most likely option was however the transfer of Failaq al-Rahman and Jaish al-Islam fighters to opposition-held areas in northern and southern Syria respectively, a rebel official familiar with the situation on the ground said. 
The defeat in eastern Ghouta would mark the worst setback for the anti-Assad rebellion since the opposition was driven from eastern Aleppo in late 2016 after a similar campaign of siege, bombing, ground assaults and the promise of safe passage out.

786,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 08:27PM ET</span>",France targets sexual harassment with on-the-spot fines,"By Ingrid Melander and Marine Pennetier
PARIS (Reuters) - France will announce a series of measures against sexual violence on Wednesday, including on-the-spot fines for sexual harassment on the street and extended deadlines for filing rape complaints.
President Emmanuel Macron has said the bill is meant to ensure ""women are not afraid to be outside"", after a wave of sexual assault allegations leveled against men in the public eye around the world triggered a protest movement online.
Under the legislation, which still needs to be approved by parliament, under-age victims of rape will have until they are aged 48 to file a complaint, taking the deadline to 30 years after they turn 18, from 20 now.
The law will also set an age - 15 - under which one will be presumed not to have agreed to having sex with someone aged 18 or more. This age of consent will facilitate rape prosecutions, Gender Equality Minister Marlene Schiappa said. 
Together with the age of consent, one of the most eye-catching aspects of the bill, whose main points have been publicly debated over the past few months, has been the plan to punish sexual harassment on the street with fines.
Schiappa said on Tuesday that the fines, to be paid on the spot by offenders, would range from 90 euros to 750 euros ($110 to $920). They could be higher for repeat offenders or in the case of aggravating circumstances.
""The idea is that it is high enough to be a deterrent but also that we could be sure the harasser can pay it immediately, so that the law can be efficient,"" Schiappa said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Live session.
However, critics have either questioned how the law could be applied or mocked it as an end to French romance.
Responding to such criticism, Schiappa told Reuters last year: ""There is some reluctance, some say we will kill the culture of the 'French lover'... if we punish street harassment.""
""But it's the opposite. We want to preserve seduction, chivalry and 'l'amour à la francaise' by saying what is key is consent. Between consenting adults everything is allowed, we can seduce, talk, but if someone says 'no', it's 'no' and it's final,"" she said.
Schiappa has said street harassment would cover situations such as asking a woman for her phone number a dozen times when she has made clear she is not interested.
The bill will also introduce tougher sanctions for sexual harassment online. 
""We want to put an end to this group cyber-harassment by making clear that every single person that is taking part will have to answer for it, even if they just sent a few tweets,"" Schiappa said on Tuesday.

(Reuters) - An Iranian who chairs a Maltese bank has been arrested on U.S. charges he participated in a scheme to evade U.S. sanctions and funnel more than $115 million paid under a Venezuelan construction contract through the U.S. financial system, prosecutors said on Tuesday.
Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad, 38, was charged in a six-count indictment filed in federal court in Manhattan for his role in a scheme to evade U.S. economic sanctions against Iran, prosecutors said.
Sadr, the chairman of Maltese-registered Pilatus Bank, was arrested on Monday in Dulles, Virginia, according to court papers. A lawyer for Sadr declined comment.
Prosecutors said Sadr's family controlled an Iranian conglomerate called Stratus Group, which had international business operations and that led a project to construct thousands of housing units in Venezuela.
That project stemmed from agreements that Iran and Venezuela entered into in 2004 and 2005 that called for cooperation between to two governments in constructing housing units in the South American nation.
The indictment said an Iranian company that Stratus incorporated, Iranian International Housing Corporation (IIHC), entered into a $476 million deal in 2006 with a Venezuelan-state owned energy company to build 7,000 housing units.
Sadr belonged to a committee overseeing the project's execution, prosecutors said.
They said that Sadr took steps as part of the project to evade U.S. economic sanctions by concealing the role of Iran and Iranian parties in payments sent through the U.S. banking system.
""As alleged, Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad created a network of front companies and foreign bank accounts to mask Iranian business dealings in Venezuela and evade U.S. sanctions,"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in a statement.
The Venezuelan energy company made $115 million in payments to IIHC using entities in Switzerland and Turkey to conceal the Iranian connection to the funds, prosecutors said.
Sadr faces six counts, including conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

788,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 05:35PM ET</span>",Crime spike prompts Canada to unveil tougher gun control steps,"By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's Liberal government unveiled proposals on Tuesday to tighten already tough gun control laws to address a spike in crimes involving firearms, including a deadly attack on a mosque last year.
The measures include enhanced background checks on people seeking to buy firearms, especially those with a history of violence. They also would oblige retailers to maintain adequate records of inventories and sales.
Although Canada has much stricter firearms restrictions than the United States, Ottawa says crimes involving guns rose 30 percent from 2013 to 2016. Gun homicides jumped 66 percent in the same period.
""Hard evidence shows a gun violence issue that is serious, getting worse, and not confined to big cities,"" Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale told reporters when unveiling draft legislation that contained the proposals.
Six people died when a gunman attacked a Quebec City mosque last year.
Experts say that although Canada's gun laws ban dozens of assault rifles, some permitted firearms are easily modified for greater damage, and lax U.S. regulations make smuggled weapons accessible.
The Liberals promised last month to spend C$327.6 million ($250.4 million) over five years to tighten border security to block the illegal trafficking of guns and drugs.
The measures outlined on Tuesday could prompt voter anger against Liberal legislators in rural parliamentary constituencies who will face off against the official opposition Conservatives in the October 2019 election.
The National Firearms Association said it would campaign against what it called seriously misguided legislation.
""Firearms owners and users in Canada when motivated are a very strong political force,"" association president Sheldon Clare said in a statement.
Conservative public safety spokesman Pierre Paul-Hus said the measures ""treat law-abiding firearms owners as criminals.""
The Conservatives promise to resist attempts to recreate a federal registry of shotguns and rifles that was set up after a gunman killed 14 women in 1989. 
The then-Conservative government abolished the registry in 2012, arguing it was wasteful and did nothing to cut crime.
Goodale said the government would not recreate the registry. Asked about possible electoral losses, he noted there had been extensive public consultations and added: ""We think the balance we have stuck represents a good strong Canadian consensus.""
Canadian gun owners must obtain licenses and go through safety training and extensive checks. A restricted class of guns must be registered for tracking, while fully automatic weapons are prohibited.
The AR-15 assault-style rifle, used in several recent U.S. massacres, is heavily restricted. Owners are subject to particularly thorough tests and verification measures, a government official told reporters on Tuesday.

789,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 06:15PM ET</span>",Minnesota officer charged with murder in Australian's death,"By Todd Melby
MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - The Minneapolis police officer who fatally shot an unarmed Australian woman last July was arrested on Tuesday on charges of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, prosecutors said.
Mohamed Noor, 32, turned himself in and was arrested for the death of Justine Damond, 40, who had called 911 about a possible sexual assault near her house, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said at a news conference announcing the charges.
""There is no evidence that Officer Noor encountered a threat, appreciated a threat, investigated a threat or confirmed a threat that justified his decision to use deadly force,"" Freeman said. ""Instead, Officer Noor recklessly and intentionally fired his handgun.""
After Noor shot her, Damond put her hands on the gunshot wound on the left side of her abdomen and said, ""I'm dying"" or ""I'm dead,"" Freeman said. 
The shooting drew condemnation in Minnesota and Australia, where Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called it ""shocking"" and ""inexplicable."" Then-Minneapolis police chief Jamee Harteau resigned after city officials said procedures had been violated and Damond ""didn't have to die."" 
The third-degree murder charge accused Noor of committing an ""eminently dangerous act"" and showing a ""depraved mind,"" and the second-degree manslaughter charge cited ""culpable negligence creating unreasonable risk,"" the records showed.
The penalty for third-degree murder is up to 25 years in prison and second-degree manslaughter carries a penalty of up to 10 years, according to a state website. 
Freeman, Minneapolis' top prosecutor, had delayed his decision in December, saying his office needed more time and that he lacked sufficient evidence to charge Noor.
Noor has been on paid leave and refused to be interviewed by Minnesota state investigators. Noor's attorney, Tom Plunkett, said his client should not be charged.
""The loss of Justine Ruszczyk Damond is a tragedy and Officer Noor again personally extends his continued condolences to her family for their loss,"" Plunkett said in a statement. 
""The facts will show that Officer Noor acted as he has been trained and consistent with established departmental policy,"" Plunkett added. ""Officer Noor should not have been charged with any crime.""
'INIQUITOUS ACT'
Damond's fiance, Don Damond, and her father, John Ruszczyk, issued a joint statement in which they praised the decision to charge Noor and hoped it resulted in a conviction, calling it ""one step toward justice for this iniquitous act.""
""No charges can bring our Justine back. However, justice demands accountability for those responsible for recklessly killing the fellow citizens they are sworn to protect,"" they said in the statement.
Damond, who was living in Minneapolis and engaged to be married, approached the police after their arrival, authorities have said. She had owned a meditation and life-coaching company.
Neither Noor, who came to the United States from Somalia as a child, nor Matthew Harrity, another officer in the patrol car, had their body cameras activated, police have said.
Harrity was startled by a loud sound near the patrol car shortly before Noor fired from the passenger seat of the patrol car through Harrity's window, Freeman said.
Harrity, who pulled out his handgun during the incident but did not fire it, said both officers ""got spooked"" when Damond appeared ""out of nowhere,"" Freeman said. 

Noor is scheduled to make an initial court appearance on Wednesday in Hennepin County District Court in Minneapolis. Prosecutors are asking that Noor's bail be set at $500,000, Freeman said.

790,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 03:50PM ET</span>",Mexican leftist's 'big tent' pitch puts presidency in sight,"By Dave Graham
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - After years of denouncing his political opponents in Mexico as stooges of a corrupt ""mafia,"" leftist leader Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has extended his hand to them in a bid to make it third time lucky in the July 1 presidential election.
So far, it's working.
In a few months, he has assembled a coalition stretching from socially conservative Christian evangelicals to admirers of socialist Venezuela and business tycoons, each with contrasting visions for Mexico.
Dozens of lawmakers from across the political spectrum have switched sides to join Lopez Obrador's National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), a party that is not yet four years old.
From the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the center, the National Action Party (PAN) on the right and the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) and Citizens' Movement on the left, defectors are steadily broadening MORENA's base.
The shift has added to a sense that history may be on MORENA's side in 2018, and has raised some hopes that Lopez Obrador, a perennial bugbear of the Mexican establishment, may be preparing to adopt a more consensual approach to governing.
""The doors of this movement are open to people from the PRI, the PAN, the Citizens Movement, who are already choosing to join this struggle,"" Lopez Obrador told thousands of supporters in a speech in the central city of Guadalajara last month.
""All parties are welcome,"" the 64-year-old former mayor of Mexico City said. ""It's happening as a natural process.""
The words are a pivot from his longstanding refrain that the main parties belong to the ""mafia of power"" - Lopez Obrador's shorthand for corrupt political and business interests that thrive while much of the country is stuck in poverty.
After Enrique Pena Nieto won Mexico's presidency in 2012, he quickly brokered a loose alliance between the PRI, PAN and PRD so he could pass legislation in Congress, where no party has held an outright majority for more than two decades.
Lopez Obrador seized on the alliance, known as the Pact for Mexico, as evidence the main parties were in cahoots, helping to polarize the political landscape.
As the election nears, however, Lopez Obrador is seeking to bring those same political forces into his own orbit.
The ideological diversity of his alliance could breed future tensions. For now though, discontent over corruption, rising violence and tepid economic growth have shattered confidence in the PRI.
The electoral hopes of the PAN and the PRD, meanwhile, have been undermined by years of infighting. 
Unsure if they could win alone, the PAN and PRD opted to run on a joint ticket, upping the competition for safe seats on electoral lists, and making politicians who feel squeezed out natural new recruits for Lopez Obrador's young party.
""The traditional parties in Mexico have become fiefdoms of the few, and have moved away from the people,"" said Senator Gabriela Cuevas, who left the PAN to join Lopez Obrador in January.
""The movement (Lopez Obrador) heads is about inclusion, and it takes a pluralist view of Mexico,"" she added.
Nevertheless, his populist instincts and the personalized flavor of his movement unsettle critics, who fear Lopez Obrador will seek to impose a presidential system of rule in a country where one size increasingly does not fit all.
MOMENTUM
Recent polls give the silver-haired Lopez Obrador a lead of more than 13 percentage points over his closest rival, Ricardo Anaya, who heads the PAN-PRD alliance. He holds an even bigger advantage over the PRI contender, Jose Antonio Meade.
Making matters worse for the PRI, January data from polling firm Buendia & Laredo showed that Anaya supporters are almost twice as likely to favor Lopez Obrador over Meade as a second choice.
Lopez Obrador had a similar lead in March 2006. But his spiky, abrasive response to efforts to paint him as an economic liability sapped his momentum and he lost narrowly to Felipe Calderon, the PAN candidate. He then staged massive protests, claiming he had been robbed.
The protests angered many Mexicans and Lopez Obrador was well off the early pace in 2012. But he finished the campaign strongly to place second again behind Pena Nieto of the PRI.
Lopez Obrador's adversaries hoped he would again slip up in 2018. So far, he has fared better, laughing off criticism and minding his words, said Hector Larios, a senior PAN senator.
At the same time, the PAN and the PRI have attacked each other relentlessly with accusations of corruption, allowing Lopez Obrador to float blithely above the fray.
Via its ally, the Labor Party, Lopez Obrador's MORENA now forms the third biggest group in the Senate as a result of more than a dozen walk-outs from the PRD, PAN and PRI.
In the lower house, MORENA has absorbed 15 deputies from other parties. Reports of new defections to Lopez Obrador's side at state, local or federal level trickle in almost daily.
""He's generating this attraction because he's got a momentum that makes him look like a winner,"" said Larios.
Still, many influential entrepreneurs remain wary of Lopez Obrador, and the powerful CCE business lobby has rebuked him for threatening to unpick parts of Pena Nieto's economic agenda.
Businesses are especially worried by Lopez Obrador's pledges to halt auctions of new oil and gas contracts and to scrap the government's plan for a new Mexico City airport.
To allay those concerns, senior advisers, such as MORENA president Yeidckol Polevnsky, have promised to foster continuity within the government bureaucracy.

""If we intend to govern for everyone, obviously we have space for everybody,"" she told Reuters.

791,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 03:10PM ET</span>","EU primes UK trade offer, seeks Brexit transition endorsement","By Alastair Macdonald and Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU governments agreed on Tuesday to offer British banks and airlines hope of good market access after Brexit but kept London waiting for confirmation it will get the transition deal it wants to avoid disrupting business.
European Council President Donald Tusk, who chairs a European Union summit on Friday, has yet to secure assent from all 27 leaders to the status-quo transition accord that British Prime Minister Theresa May struck with EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday.
EU officials and diplomats said some countries had further questions for Tusk, including Spain, which was looking for assurances over Gibraltar.
However, two senior officials said there was little chance of holding up the transition deal which pushed the pound higher on Monday as it gives businesses an extra 21 months to prepare for full Brexit.
Barnier and the Bulgarian minister who chaired Tuesday's ministerial talks to prepare the summit told reporters the EU27 fully backed Madrid's insistence that it have a veto on any Brexit terms for Britain's territory on its south coast.
British ministers have said that bilateral negotiations with Spain over Gibraltar were going well.
The ministerial meeting approved a first set of negotiating guidelines by which the 27 governments will bind Barnier to seek a free trade deal with Britain after Brexit, due next March, and the end of the transition period at the end of 2020. Talks should start in the coming weeks. 
The text blunts May's hopes of getting a uniquely close relationship with the EU's single market. 
It says her refusal to accept single market or customs union rules will mean ""frictions in trade"", but voices the EU's willingness to seek a close free trade agreement.
A TEST OF UNITY
In a sign of how negotiating future trade ties with what is still one of the bloc's three biggest economies will test the unity of the 27, member states are already pushing their own interests on some issues.
Two elements attached to the guidelines highlight that.
In one, the EU agrees that Barnier's instructions to arrange a fix for the airline industry that will avoid major disruption when Britain leaves ""do not preclude"" a future EU-UK aviation deal giving British-owned airlines special freedoms in the EU, similar to those offered to the United States and Canada.
That reflects discussions among member states, including Spain - concerned its British-owned national flag carrier Iberia might suffer on intra-EU routes - and Finland and others, who have raised worries about their airports' role as layovers between London and Asia. 
On financial services, Luxembourg, home to many British-based fund operations, has been pushing for generous access for London firms to the EU, something France, which hopes to draw banking business to Paris, has resisted.
The result was a compromise drafted by Luxembourg and France that offers British banks ""improved equivalence"" treatment in the EU, reflecting plans to streamline procedures for letting firms in non-EU states operate in some markets if their home supervision regulations are seen as matching EU standards.

The offer, however, is sharply circumscribed by underlining that the EU will have ""unilateral"" control over how that would work, and also puts an end to London's hopes of any system close to its existing open ""passports"" to EU business.
Barnier repeated his view that Monday's interim accord on the withdrawal treaty was a key moment, raising hopes that a deal can be struck later in the year to ensure an orderly Brexit next March followed by a status-quo transition of 21 months.
But, he warned, there were outstanding issues over treaty oversight and how - despite assurances by May - to avoid a disruptive ""hard border"" on the island of Ireland. 

""My experience of negotiations... is that what remains at the end is often the most difficult,"" Barnier told reporters.

792,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 02:31PM ET</span>",Maduro challenger promises U.S. dollar giveaway for Venezuelans,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Opposition presidential candidate Henri Falcon's campaign vowed on Tuesday to implement a $25 monthly giveaway to Venezuelans, as part of plans to dollarize the crisis-hit economy and alleviate suffering should he win the May 20 vote. 
Former state governor Falcon, 56, has broken with an opposition boycott to stand against President Nicolas Maduro in a vote critics say is rigged in advance to perpetuate a socialist ""dictatorship"" in the OPEC nation.
Falcon says he is a natural transition candidate with appeal to a majority fed up with political polarization and economic chaos, and some polls have put him ahead of Maduro. 
But the government is linking loyalty at the ballot box to welfare handouts, including a food bag many poor Venezuelans rely on, and benefits from a compliant election board accused of fraud in two recent elections. 
During an event at Falcon's ""National Salvation"" campaign headquarters in Caracas, his economic policy adviser Francisco Rodriguez said adults would receive a ""solidarity card"" giving them $25 a month, and children $10, under their new government.
Venezuela has for 15 years maintained currency controls that make it difficult to obtain foreign exchange and prohibit merchants from charging in U.S. currency. A black market does exist, however, where one dollar goes for 231,000 bolivars. 
Falcon proposes abandoning the increasingly worthless bolivar in favor of the dollar to attack hyper-inflation.
""Today our future begins,"" Rodriguez, a Wall Street economist, told a rally to present Falcon's campaign team. 
""We find ourselves in a ruined nation. There is only one person to blame: Nicolas Maduro.""
At Tuesday's event, Falcon taunted Maduro as ""the candidate of hunger"" and ""the candidate of disaster"", and announced plans to begin his street campaign in east Venezuela on Wednesday. 

Falcon's populist ""solidarity card"" mirrors an existing ""fatherland card"" set up by the Maduro government, through which Venezuelans can access welfare programs and sometimes cash giveaways. Falcon, however, mocked the amount given people in bolivars, saying it was not even enough to buy a box of eggs.

There are some 274 million French speakers worldwide, making it the fifth most widely spoken language and the fourth most used language on the internet, according to the Francophonie organization of French-speaking countries.
French was long dominant at EU headquarters in Brussels but English has become ubiquitous in European institutions, especially since eastern European members joined the bloc in 2004.
Britain, Europe's second largest economy and by far its biggest English-speaking country, is due to leave the EU next year.
""The situation now is quite paradoxical. English has probably never been as present in Brussels at the time when we are talking about Brexit,"" Macron said.
""This domination is not inevitable. It's up to us to set some rules, to be present, and make French the language with whom one has access to a number of opportunities,"" Macron said, quoting Europe's relationship with French-speaking Africa.
Macron, who, unlike most previous French leaders often speaks in English in public when abroad, said this was not a move against the use of English but one to promote multilingualism. 
He said he was in favor of everyone in Europe learning two foreign languages and that France would increase its efforts to teach French to European officials.
Macron also announced steps to promote the teaching of French abroad, including through its network of French lycees, as part of a series of measures.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker tweeted that he was ""an enthusiastic backer of multilingualism.
""Why would Shakespeare's language be superior to that of Voltaire?"" Juncker told France 5 TV channel. ""We are wrong to have become so anglicized,"" he said, in French.

But Juncker added: ""English has become a daily working language within the EU institutions. Brexit won't change anything to it. Because those who don't come from the western part of Europe have become used to speaking in English.""

The rocket landed in the Kashkoul market close to rebel-held parts of eastern Ghouta, which has been under heavy bombardment by the Syrian army and its allies since last month. 
The army says rebels in the besieged rebel-held enclave of eastern Ghouta have repeatedly targeted civilians in state- controlled districts of the capital. Rebels deny targeting civilians.
Separately, civil defence rescuers in the rebel-held town of Douma said more than 56 civilians had been killed during Syrian and Russian aerial strikes on residential areas in dozens of raids conducted over the last 24 hours.
Rescuers and residents say napalm and incendiary bombs were being dropped on civilian targets away from the frontlines in a campaign to drive civilians out of the enclave. 
Douma, which is the largest urban centre in eastern Ghouta, had become a haven for tens of thousands of families who have fled from the frontlines and other towns that have recently fallen to the army.
""The situation in the city is catastrophic,"" said Iyad Abdel Aziz, the head of Douma civil council, adding that the plight of more than 150,000 civilians mostly taking refuge in basements had worsened.
Food was getting scarce after an aerial strike on Sunday damaged warehouses where the last shipment of U.N. aid had been stored, he added.
The army assault on the last rebel bastion near the capital has been one of the heaviest of the war, which this week enters its eighth year.

(Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked a Mississippi law that enacted the tightest restrictions on abortion in the United States, in a ruling handed down a day after the governor signed the measure.
The Mississippi law would prohibit abortion after 15 weeks of gestation, with some exceptions. It went into effect immediately after Republican Governor Phil Bryant signed it on Monday. State law previously banned abortion at 20 weeks after conception, in line with limits in 17 other states. 
The judge's ruling blocks the measure for 10 days, while he considers arguments on whether to stop the law from taking effect until the outcome of a full legal challenge. 
""The Supreme Court says every woman has a constitutional right to 'personal privacy' regarding her body,"" U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves in Jackson, Mississippi, said in a two-page ruling that quoted from the high court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion.
The judge said a stay was justified because the Mississippi law's proposed 15-week limit is outside of the medical consensus about when fetus becomes vital, raising questions about whether it violates the U.S. Constitution.
Abortion rights groups say anti-abortion organizations could use the case to test limits on abortion all the way to the Supreme Court. The court in the past has struck down prohibitions on abortion before fetal viability, usually considered to be about 20 weeks of gestation.
The Jackson Women's Health Organization, the only clinic providing abortions in Mississippi, sued to block the measure on Monday.
""We will fight this unconstitutional ban and ensure that women can access legal and safe abortion care, no matter their zip code,"" the New York City-based Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the clinic in court, said in a statement on Twitter after the ruling. 
In 2016, the Supreme Court refused to uphold an Arkansas law that banned abortion after 12 weeks' gestation as well as a North Dakota six-week law.

The Mississippi governor called the judge's ruling on Tuesday disappointing.
""House Bill 1510 protects maternal health and will further our efforts to make Mississippi the safest place in America for an unborn child,"" Bryant said in a statement. ""We are confident in its constitutionality and look forward to vigorously defending it."" 
The Mississippi law includes an exception in the case of severe fetal abnormality or a medical emergency.

The British region has for over a year been without a devolved power-sharing executive, a central plank of a 1998 peace agreement that ended three decades of violence between pro-British unionists and Irish nationalists.
The deal also created the British–Irish Intergovernmental Conference, a joint consultative body recognizing the Irish government's special interest in Northern Ireland that last met over a decade ago in the midst of similar political deadlock.
""When I spoke to her (Britain's Northern Ireland Minister Karen Bradley) last in advance of her update in relation to Northern Ireland in Westminster, I did say that I would like her to consider an Intergovernmental Conference,"" Coveney told parliament. He gave no date for the conversation. 
""I felt it was appropriate at this stage that we would have that structure enacted so that both governments could formally discuss the various options that they need to consider. I haven't got a response in relation to that yet, she said she wanted to think about it.""
The British government moved this month to impose a budget directly on Northern Ireland in the latest step toward re-imposing direct rule of the region, prompting calls from Irish nationalists for an Intergovernmental Conference.

Dublin has since called on the parties to sit down again and attempt to restore devolved government next month. Coveney said he would travel to Belfast on Wednesday to meet the parties and would speak to Bradley again before the end of the week.

799,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 07:12PM ET</span>",Trump praises U.S. military sales to Saudi as he welcomes crown prince,"By Steve Holland and Yara Bayoumy
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump gave a warm welcome to Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday and credited U.S. defense sales to the Saudis with boosting American jobs, even as Riyadh's involvement in Yemen's civil war faced criticism.
In the Oval Office, Trump and the crown prince praised the strength of U.S.-Saudi ties, which had grown strained under the Obama administration in part over differing views toward Riyadh's regional rival, Iran.
Not so with Trump, who has taken a hardline view against Iran similar to that of the Saudi crown prince who has compared Iran's supreme leader to Adolf Hitler.
The talks were part of the first visit by the prince to the United States since he became the heir apparent last year to King Salman.
Trump's red-carpet treatment highlighted his administration's strong backing of the crown prince, who carried out an anti-corruption purge that consolidated his power and whose aggressive foreign policy has caused unease among some Western allies.
At the same time, the kingdom has seen a cautious new climate of social freedoms with the rise of the 32-year-old crown prince after decades of elderly rulers.
Trump and Prince Mohammed discussed an agreement last year for $200 billion worth of Saudi investments with the United States, including large purchases of U.S. military equipment. Trump said the military sales contributed to the creation of 40,000 American jobs. 
Trump held up charts to show the depth of Saudi purchases of U.S. military hardware, ranging from ships to missile defense to planes and fighting vehicles.
""Saudi Arabia is a very wealthy nation, and they're going to give the United States some of that wealth, hopefully, in the form of jobs, in the form of the purchase of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,"" he told reporters.
The crown prince, who is also the defense minister, is on a public relations blitz while traveling in the United States, with stops in New York, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Houston to cultivate investments. 
As they talked, U.S. senators debated a resolution seeking an end to U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's campaign in Yemen's civil war, in which about 10,000 people have been killed. Some members of Congress have been critical of the Saudi involvement, particularly over the humanitarian situation and civilian casualties. The Senate rejected the resolution. 
A Saudi-led coalition, with logistical and intelligence support from Washington, is fighting to counter the influence of Iran, an ally of the Houthi militia, which denies any help from Tehran and says it is fighting a revolution against corrupt politicians and Gulf powers in thrall to the West.
A senior Trump administration official said the two leaders talked about the humanitarian situation in Yemen and that civilian casualties ""did not come up in a major way,"" given that Washington had been working with the Saudis to minimize them.
They also discussed nuclear cooperation. Riyadh has been stepping up plans to develop a civilian nuclear energy capability as part of a plan to reduce its dependence on oil.
Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the chamber's Foreign Relations Committee, said senators questioned the crown prince closely about Yemen during a meeting with him on Tuesday. 
The Saudi embassy said the prince discussed with members ""countering the threat posed by Iran and the Iran-backed Houthi militias"" as well as Saudi ""efforts to address and alleviate the humanitarian situation in Yemen.""
PRINCE'S RAPID RISE
Prince Mohammed capped his rapid rise to power last June by replacing his elder cousin Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who had close relationships with U.S. intelligence and defense circles, as crown prince. He is likely to rule for many decades if he succeeds his father.
Trump praised the king's move to elevate Mohammed and called U.S.-Saudi ties strong as ever.
""I thought your father made a very wise decision. And I miss your father - a special man,"" he said. King Salman is to visit the United States later this year.
Although the prince has won Western plaudits for seeking to ease Saudi Arabia’s reliance on oil, tackle chronic corruption and reform the conservative Sunni Muslim kingdom, the severity and secrecy of his anti-corruption crackdown last November unnerved some in the West.
The crown prince, in a rare foray into speaking English, said on Tuesday the Saudi pledge for $200 billion in investments would end up at $400 billion when fully implemented. He said a 10-year window for implementing the deal was under way.
A key focus of his visit will be any information on a potentially lucrative listing of up to 5 percent of Saudi oil firm Aramco. The New York Stock Exchange is among the possible venues for the listing.
Also high on the agenda in the White House talks was confronting Iran, a country Trump has repeatedly criticized for its expansionist policies in the Middle East. 
Saudi Arabia on Monday called the Iran nuclear deal a ""flawed agreement,"" and Trump has made clear he plans to exit the agreement unless changes are made to it.
""But Iran has not been treating that part of the world or the world itself appropriately,"" he said. ""The deal is coming up in one month and we’ll see what happens.""
The prince was also due to have dinner with Jared Kushner, Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law, along with Jason Greenblatt, the two point men in the Trump administration overseeing Middle East peace efforts.

Crown Prince Mohammed and Kushner have forged a close relationship, which has at times come under criticism in Washington for circumventing normal diplomatic channels.

800,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>","Sweden to tighten rape legislation, outlawing non-consensual sex","STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The Swedish government on Tuesday sent a bill that would outlaw sex not based on mutual consent to parliament for approval, widening the circumstances that could constitute rape or other sex crimes.
With the new law, Sweden will join a small number of countries, including Britain and Canada, where the lack of consent, even without violence, is enough to constitute a crime.
Sweden has had a relatively wide definition of rape in an international context and its laws on sex crimes came into the spotlight when the country put out an arrest warrant for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange over rape allegations.
Sweden has since dropped that investigation but Assange is remains holed up in Ecuador's London embassy where he took refuge since 2012 for allegedly jumping bail in Britain.
To obtain a rape conviction, the draft Swedish law would no longer require violence or the threat of violence or that the perpetrator had exploited a victim's vulnerable situation.
""Sex should be voluntary. Everything else is abuse,"" tweeted Morgan Johansson, Minister for Justice and Home Affairs.
The government stopped short of making expressed consent a condition for consensual sex. But the bill states that ""in the judgment of whether participation is voluntary, it should be taken into special consideration whether consent has been expressed in words or action"".
""If a person wants to engage in sexual activities with someone who remains inactive or gives ambiguous signals, he or she will therefore have to find out if the other person is willing,"" the bill reads.
The proposal is likely to pass parliament and come into force on July 1 this year.
Assange took refuge in London's Ecuadorian Embassy in June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden after two women made rape and sexual molestation allegations against him, which he denied.

They have agreed to step up U.N.-brokered negotiations this year to resolve the dispute, which has undermined Skopje's hopes of joining NATO and the European Union.
Greece, a member of both, argues that its northern neighbor's use of the name Macedonia, along with parts of its constitution, could imply a territorial claim over the Greek region of the same name.
""The draft proposals have been sent ...and we are now waiting for their comments and remarks,"" Greek government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told journalists on Tuesday.
""The plan has been drafted based on Greece's standard negotiating positions,"" which included demands for constitutional modifications, he said, without going into detail.
Greece has said a compromise could include an as yet undecided compound name with a geographical or chronological qualifier by which the country would be subsequently known.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said after receiving the document that no specific name was under discussion but Skopje had sent its own version back to Athens, and he had reasons to be hopeful.
Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias will meet his Macedonian counterpart Nikola Dimitrov in Skopje on Thursday and Friday, and again in Vienna on March 30 at talks hosted by United Nations special envoy Matthew Nimetz. 
Zaev said he would also meet Kotzias in Skopje, adding in a statement: ""I am glad that the Greek side is committed to finding ... ways to solve the problem which it has with our constitutional name, while preserving the dignity and integrity of both sides."" 
The two states have made little progress on the issue since 1991, when Macedonia split from the former Yugoslavia. Pending a settlement, it was admitted to the United Nations in 1993 under the name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).
Last month Kotzias said in an interview with Reuters that the draft would not contain only Greek views but would be a basis for cooperation.
Both sides hope for a settlement before a NATO summit in July. But protests in both countries are an indication of popular resistance to any compromise.

Extreme hot and dry weather ignited the two lethal fires in June and October, which led to the resignation of the interior minister and the introduction of far-reaching measures to tackle the blazes that ravage the abandoned interior every summer.
""What happened was unique, because of the extreme violence (of the disasters),"" Maria Lucia Amaral told reporters, adding that the total amount of authorized claims will be around 31 million euros. ""Nobody has been left out,"" she said. 
The government assumed the responsibility of compensating victims' families in a process that was overseen by Aramal. The deadline for applications was in February.
A separate process to compensate the injured will run until May.
The authorities faced harsh criticism for the fires, including that rescue services and firefighters were slow to react. The government survived a no confidence vote in parliament in October over the fires. [nL8N1MZ7B9] 
A government report found that the fire in June was caused by an unusually dangerous mix of heat and powerful winds, which led the blaze to spread extremely quickly, killing many in their cars as they tried to escape through a forest road.
The government has now adopted a series of fire prevention measures which have been discussed for many years in Portugal, including enforcing strict rules on cutting down undergrowth on properties and developing a full land registry for the country.
A key reason for Portugal's regular summer forest fires is that much of the interior is owned by absent landlords, making it difficult to enforce clearing of land to prevent fires spreading.

Agrokor [AGROK.UL], the largest private firm in the Balkans, was put under state administration for 15 months last April after it buckled following a rapid expansion program that left it weighed down by borrowing.
But crisis manager Ante Ramljak stepped down last month after the government voiced discontent that his former employer had been hired as a consultant on the restructuring program - potentially setting up a conflict of interests.
The opposition's motion, proposed by the center-right ""Most"" (""Bridge"") party, says that Dalic, who is also the economy minister, should have known who was chosen as consultants in Agrokor and what fees were paid to them.
""Someone has to bear a political responsibility, and Dalic chose Ramljak in the first place,"" Most's parliamentary deputy Nikola Grmoja said after the motion had been submitted.
The opposition, including the biggest opposition party the Social Democrats, also accuses the government of handling the Agrokor crisis poorly. The new crisis management in Agrokor expects to have the settlement terms ready by April 10.
The ruling coalition, comprising the conservative HDZ party, the liberal HNS party and deputies from national minorities, has a tiny majority of 78 deputies in the 151-seat parliament.
While the government would not fall immediately if Dalic were to lose the vote, the tightness of the numbers would likely indicate the prime minister would no longer have control of parliament - potentially storing up problems for the future.
The vote must take place within 30 days.
""We'll see how some of the deputies and the HDZ partners will vote as some comment in the corridors that Dalic should leave,"" Grmoja said. 
Dalic's HDZ said it was confident the unity in the ruling majority would be preserved. She has said she has been focused on saving Agrokor from bankruptcy.
The Agrokor restructuring process is focused on a deal among creditors which should yield a combination of a new sustainable debt and equity. The creditors include the foreign and local banks, bondholders and suppliers whose overall claims amount to close to 60 billion kuna ($9.90 billion).
Ramljak has said his former firm was engaged by the U.S.-based chief restructuring adviser as he had to act quickly at the beginning to save Agrokor from bankruptcy and he trusted his former colleagues. He was not accused of any legal wrongdoing.

The new law, promoted by French President Emmanuel Macron and backed by Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands, among others, would rein in current rules on the so-called posting of workers, which richer EU states say undercut their labor markets.
Poorer EU states from Spain to Poland have opposed the change, saying their citizens should be allowed to work in a wealthier state on a lower salary than a worker from the host country under the bloc's competition rules.
The deal, which had been tentatively agreed earlier this month, also introduces a two-year transition period. It is likely to be finally endorsed in April in a session in which Poland and Hungary expect to be outvoted. 
Under the incoming rules, posted workers would start earning the host country salary after the maximum period allowed.
The European Parliament on Tuesday hailed the deal as a way to ensure ""equal pay for equal work"" but Poland's Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski said it was a case of more powerful EU states like France imposing their will on the others.

Decades-old animosity between Sunni Muslim kingdom of Saudi Arabia and revolutionary Shi'ite Iran has deepened in recent years as the two sides wage proxy wars in the Middle East and beyond, including in Iraq, Syria and Yemen.
Iran's murky and fluid relationship with al Qaeda has contributed to tensions with Riyadh, which previously accused Tehran of backing al Qaeda and sheltering its members.
Prince Mohammed told CBS in an interview that Iran was protecting al Qaeda operatives, including some of bin Laden's relatives. 
""This includes the son of Osama bin Laden, the new leader of al Qaeda. He lives in Iran and works out of Iran. He is supported by Iran,"" he said.
Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi called crown prince's comments a ""big lie"".
Hamza bin Laden was one of several bin Ladens who ended up in Iran after the September 11 attacks on New York in 2001. Documents recovered from his father's compound in Pakistan after he was killed in a U.S. raid in 2011 said Hamza was, at least for a period, held under house arrest Iran. His current whereabouts are not known.
Since Osama bin Laden's death, al Qaeda has been led by his former deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Nonetheless Hamza has issued a number of messages on behalf of the network in recent years, threatening further violence against the West.
The group has been sidelined significantly by its rival and foe, the militant organization Islamic State. 
Iran's Qasemi said that after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan began in 2001, some al Qaeda fighters had crossed into Iran illegally, but that they had been arrested and extradited to their countries of origin. These included bin Laden family members with Saudi citizenship.
""Bin Laden's daughter was extradited to the Saudi embassy in Tehran,"" Qasemi was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency.
""Upon consultation with Saudi Arabia, other members of Bin Laden family were deported through the same border they had illegally entered Iran,"" he added.
Shi’ite Muslim Iran and strict Sunni militant group al Qaeda are natural enemies on either side of the Muslim world’s great sectarian divide. Yet intelligence veterans say that Iran, in pursuing its own ends, has in the past taken advantage of al Qaeda fighters’ need to shelter or pass through its territory.

In Sunday's interview Prince Mohammed also accused Iran of having recruited some of the Saudis who took part in the 9/11 attacks on New York, with the aim of creating a ""schism between the Middle East and the West, between Saudi Arabia and the United States of America.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - Britain accused Russia of spreading ""half-truths and half-lies"" in a U.N. debate on Tuesday over a nerve toxin attack on a Russian double agent, while Russian officials quoted British opposition politicians to raise doubts about the allegations.
Britain accuses Moscow of using the Soviet-era military-grade nerve agent Novichok in an attack on former Sergei Skripal and his daughter, who are critically ill in hospital, a charge which Russia has denied.
Russian diplomats told the Conference on Disarmament at the United Nations in Geneva that Britain was not living up to its obligations by failing to share evidence with Moscow on the case and said Russia should be considered innocent until proven guilty.
""We would note that even the leader of the (British opposition) Labour party Jeremy Corbyn has asked to have at least a parliamentary appraisal of the investigation, but he has also received negative response, and I don't need to comment any further on this,"" Denis Davydov, a Russian representative, said. 
Russia's destruction of its chemical weapons after the fall of the Soviet Union had been verified, and Russia had not conducted any research into Novichok although research continued in Britain and possibly in many other countries, he said.
The attack on the Skripals took place in the town of Salisbury, close to the British government's laboratory at Porton Down, which had the potential to produce Novichok, Davydov added.
One of the ingredients also existed in the United States for a long time, he said.
British Ambassador Matthew Rowland said Russia was using ""a series of wild hypotheses and half truth and half lies"" to deflect attention from the truth, and its claim to have destroyed Novichok was ""not clear at all"".
Rowland disagreed with Davydov that Russia had a right to see the evidence, saying he was trying to confuse the picture with misleading procedural arguments.
""Russia's attempt to hide behind a false interpretation of the chemical weapons convention should fool no one,"" he said. 
U.S. disarmament ambassador Robert Wood said Russia's suggestion that the nerve agent used against Skripal could have come from a British or a U.S. facility was ""just absurd"" and an example of typical Russian propaganda in which Moscow blamed others for what it itself had done. 
Davydov said Moscow had been met with ultimatums when it answered Britain's questions, and British sources could not necessarily be trusted.
""We all remember very well that public opinion in that country believed the word of Prime Minister Tony Blair when he led his country into the Iraq war. He confirmed and was completely convinced that the Saddam Hussein regime possessed chemical weapons, but as it turned out he himself was set up by his own allies.""

Moldova and Russia were embroiled in a series of rows last year, including tit-for-tat expulsions of each other's diplomats and Moldova declaring the Russian deputy prime minister persona non grata.
Ex-Soviet Moldova is politically divided between a pro-Western government, which favors closer integration with the European Union, and Russian-backed President Igor Dodon.
Ambassador Andrei Negutsa, who will return to Russia in the coming days, has been consulting with the Moldovan authorities on the outlook for relations with Moscow, Foreign Minister Tudor Ulianovschi told a meeting.
""We discussed the whole range of bilateral, Moldova-Russia ties, which in recent times have been going through a difficult period,"" Ulianovschi said. ""I focused on the need to reject pressure from the Russian side on Moldovan citizens and officials visiting Russia.""
Last year the Chisinau government said its officials were being mistreated partly to derail a Moldovan investigation into an alleged Russian-led money laundering operation. Russia has accused Moldova of ""some openly anti-Russian actions"".
The Moldovan ambassador was recalled in December.
Since his election in late 2016, President Dodon's pro-Russia stance has caused frequent clashes with the government, which has sought to curb his efforts to undermine Moldova's bid to move closer towards Europe.

""Our common objective should be to re-establish a cooperative pan-European security order,"" Juncker wrote. ""I hope that you will use your fourth term in office to pursue this goal,"" he said, adding: ""I will always be a partner in this endeavor.""
After dominating the political landscape for the last 18 years, Putin comfortably won reelection on Sunday. U.S. President Donald Trump has yet to congratulate Putin, although the Kremlin said that was not ""an unfriendly act"". [nR4N1QY00W]
With East-West ties at post-Cold War lows, Juncker's congratulatory letter followed the latest expression of concern about Russia from EU foreign ministers on Monday over the nerve agent attack on a former Russian double agent on British soil. 
In a statement, ministers said the European Union ""takes extremely seriously the UK government's assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible"". Russia denies any involvement. [nL8N1R1299]
Juncker, a former Luxembourg premier, courted criticism in June 2016 when he attended an economic forum with Putin in St. Petersburg when most EU leaders were seeking to isolate Russia diplomatically over Russia's 2014 seizure of Ukraine's Crimea.
However, Juncker has long argued that, while maintaining sanctions on Russia, the EU should engage more with Moscow to push the Kremlin to curtail its disinformation campaign against the West and seek an end to the conflict in eastern Ukraine.

In October 2015, Juncker spoke out in favor of Moscow, saying: ""Russia must be treated decently. We can't let our relationship with Russia be dictated by Washington.""

The 56-year-old Djukanovic, a former communist, rose to prominence in the late 1980s, shortly before the violent breakup of the former Yugoslavia in 1991. He served six terms as prime minister and one as president before taking the helm of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists in 2016. 
""This decision is the expression of my responsibility to ... Montenegro's future,"" Djukanovic said after his party's main board unanimously backed his candidacy. 
In 2016, the DPS narrowly won a parliamentary vote marred by allegations of a Russia-backed coup which attempted to prevent Montenegro from joining NATO. Dusko Markovic, the former head of Montenegro's security agency, replaced Djukanovic as Prime Minister. 
In the vote on April 15, Djukanovic will face businessman Mladen Bojanic who enjoys the backing of the opposition Democratic Front which favors closer ties with Russia, as well as the Democrats of Montenegro and the Citizen's Movement URA.
Djukanovic is the likely winner according to January polls which showed the three parties supporting opposition candidates had the backing of 37 percent of voters. Current Montenegro President Filip Vujanovic is Djukanovic's long-time political ally.

The case of two journalists, Sahin Alpay and Mehmet Altan, was taken to Turkey's Constitutional Court which ruled in January that they both be released, but a lower court threw out the decision. 
Altan, along with five other journalists, was jailed for life in February, while Alpay was released under house arrest on Saturday after more than a year in detention.
The European court ruled that during their pre-trial detention their rights to liberty, security and freedom of expression had been violated.
It also said that their continued detention after the Constitutional Court ruling ""could not be regarded as lawful and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law as required by the right to liberty and security"".
A Turkish penal court last week ordered the release of Alpay, a columnist in the now defunct Zaman daily, following a second ruling by the constitutional court.
In February, Altan and five other journalists including his brother were sentenced to life in jail for links to a failed military coup in July 2016.
The verdict of the internationally monitored case drew fierce criticism from rights groups and Turkey's Western allies, who said Turkey should reverse the decision.

Maltese prosecutors have filed a European warrant for the arrest of Maria Efimova, a Russian who left Malta for Greece last year with her family, on suspicion of embezzlement.
The police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there were two arrest warrants against her from Malta for various violations, including embezzlement.
""She was arrested last night and she is expected to appear before a prosecutor,"" the official said.
Efimova was employed for three months in 2016 by the Maltese-registered Pilatus Bank. The journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, named her as the source of internal bank documents which Galizia said indicated that Michelle Muscat, wife of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, owned a secret company in Panama. 
Joseph Muscat and his wife have denied the accusations.
Efimova also gave evidence this year to a committee of the European Parliament about the case. Ana Gomes, a Portuguese member of the assembly, demanded that EU states give her whistleblower status and grant her ""asylum or international protection, since she is at serious risk"".
Caruana Galizia was killed by a car bomb in October 2017. Three men have been charged with killing her but police have yet to name a likely motive.
Pilatus Bank has for its part accused Efimova of embezzlement. Efimova denies all charges and has counter-sued the bank for failing to pay her salary.
Efimova told Reuters by telephone on Tuesday that she had appeared at a police station in Athens but gave no further details. Subsequent calls to her went unanswered.

821,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 09:10AM ET</span>",Military man Sisi vows to safeguard Egypt's security,"By Dominic Evans
CAIRO (Reuters) - When Abdel Fattah al-Sisi announced he was standing for Egypt's highest office four years ago he said it would be his last day in uniform, a pledge which symbolized his transition from military chief to president.
But last month, with another election approaching, Sisi was back in army fatigues when he visited a military base towards the end of a first presidential term that rights groups say has been marred by an unprecedented crackdown on dissent.
Sisi was opening an anti-terrorism center in the Sinai peninsula, where he has told the army to use ""all brute force necessary"" to defeat an Islamic State insurgency which threatens the stability he promised to deliver.
The rare appearance in uniform, which Sisi has worn a handful of times since taking office, was a reminder not just of his military background but also the central role of the army and security forces under his leadership.
""I'm ready to put on military uniform and go out and fight side by side (with you),"" he told a conference in Cairo this month commemorating soldiers killed in conflict.
To his critics, the 63-year-old former intelligence general has led Egypt deeper into authoritarianism than even former president Hosni Mubarak, who was toppled in 2011 after ruling for three decades under a state of emergency.
Rights groups say Sisi has muzzled political opponents, activists and critical media, while courts have passed death sentences on hundreds of supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood since he deposed the Brotherhood's president, Mohammed Mursi, after mass protests in 2013.
Tough economic reforms, backed by the IMF, have halved the value of the pound and hit millions of poor Egyptians.
Sisi's supporters say the measures are needed to keep the country stable as it recovers from political chaos and tackles grave economic challenges and the Islamist insurgency.
Ahead of the March 26-28 election, in which no credible challenger has been able to stand, Sisi warned last month that anyone who threatened Egypt's stability would be dealt with harshly.
""I will die before anyone messes with its security,"" he said, adding that the 2011 uprising, when the army stood by while Mubarak was forced out, would not be repeated.
""Be warned. What happened seven or eight years ago will not happen again in Egypt,"" Sisi told an audience that included his own defense minister. ""It seems you don't know me well enough.""
""I'm not a politician who just talks"".
MILITARY RULERS
Sisi is the latest in a line of Egyptian rulers drawn from the military that was only briefly broken by Mursi, who lasted a year before Sisi overthrew him.
Promising to work for ""security, stability and development"" after three years of turmoil, Sisi sought to project a new dynamism when he took office - holding cabinet meetings at 7 a.m. and joining a cycle race on his first weekend as president.
The message was clear. The sclerotic, 30-year rule of former president Mubarak and the turbulence of Mursi's brief presidency were over. The new president would get things done.
In another break with the Mubarak presidency, Sisi has kept his wife and four children out of the spotlight to avoid suggestions he may have ambitions to build a political dynasty.
He has promised to abide by a two-term constitutional limit for serving presidents, a pledge which if honored would be a first in Egypt's modern history. His five predecessors were either pushed out, died in office or were assassinated.
""Building the state takes 16 to 20 years, I am trying to finish it in eight years, God willing,"" Sisi said in November.
SISI'S GOAL
Born on Nov. 19, 1954, Sisi showed signs of unusual discipline as a young boy, people in his old neighborhood of Cairo said. While other boys played football or smoked, Sisi and his friends lifted weights made of metal pipes and rocks. 
""Abdel Fattah always seemed to have a goal. He had willpower,"" said Atif al-Zaabalawi, a dye worker who used to see Sisi in the capital's Gamaliya district.
Neighbors say he came from a tightly knit religious family. A cousin, Fathi al-Sisi, who runs a handicraft shop, said the future field marshal had memorized the Koran. His father encouraged him to work in his shop every day after school. 
He lived in a small apartment on the rooftop of a run-down building owned by his extended family. Although it was a relatively well-off family, Sisi has sought to emphasize his connection with the struggles of ordinary Egyptians. 
""I lived for 10 years with nothing in the fridge except water ... and I am from a wealthy family,"" he told a youth conference in Sharm el-Sheikh two years ago.
That remark was one of several which Sisi's critics have mocked. His call for people to donate one pound a day to a development fund via their mobile phones, or a suggestion that banks divert ""loose change"" from transactions to the fund, were widely ridiculed. 
Sisi kept a low profile as Mubarak's head of military intelligence, and became the youngest member of the military council that ruled Egypt for 18 months after Mubarak resigned in February, 2011.
Mursi appointed him army chief and defense minister in August 2012, mistakenly calculating that the military would let the Brotherhood pursue its Islamist agenda as long as its own entrenched privileges were kept safe.
Sisi captured little international attention until he appeared on television on July 3, 2013, to announce the removal of Mursi after vast crowds demanded he resign, and to promise a new election which Sisi won by a landslide the following year.
Lacking the flamboyance or rhetorical skills of former presidents Gamal Abdel Nasser and Anwar Sadat, Sisi projects a calm and softly spoken persona and speaks only occasionally in public.
But pictures of Sisi are ubiquitous across Egypt and he has not publicly sought to limit the torrents of praise for him in state media.
In an unpublished segment of an interview with al Masry al-Youm daily that was leaked in an audio online ahead of his first term, he spoke of a vision that suggested he was destined to be a great leader.

""In a dream I had 35 years ago, I was raising a sword with the phrase 'There is no God but God' written on it in red,"" he said. In another dream he met Sadat and told him: ""I know that I will be president"".

The school day had barely begun when the student, who has not been identified, shot a male student and a female student at Great Mills High School in St. Mary's County before the campus security officer intervened, county Sheriff Timothy Cameron told a news conference.
""Our school resource officer who was stationed inside the school was alerted to the event and the shots being fired,"" Cameron said. ""He pursued the shooter, engaged the shooter; during that engagement he fired a round at the shooter. Simultaneously, the shooter fired a round as well.""
The officer was not harmed, the sheriff said.
The latest in a long string of deadly shootings at U.S. schools and universities took place a little more than a month after 17 students and educators were shot dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
That attack sparked a new student movement against gun violence, including a national school walkout last week that Great Mills students participated in. It occurred just days before a planned Saturday march in Washington calling for new restrictions on guns.
Parkland students and Great Mills students exchanged supportive messages on Twitter following Tuesday's shooting.
""We are here for you, students of Great Mills, together we can stop this from ever happening again,"" Emma Gonzalez, a senior at Stoneman Douglas High School who survived last month's rampage, wrote on Twitter.
A 14-year-old male student, whom the sheriff had earlier said was in critical condition, was in good condition after treatment at MedStar St Mary's Hospital, according to hospital officials. A 16-year-old female student, who also had been in critical condition, was stabilized and transferred to another hospital, they said.
The shooter used a handgun in the attack, the sheriff said. He was confirmed deceased at 10:41 a.m. ET after being taken to a hospital.
Cameron said investigators would determine whether the shooter died of a wound from the school resource officer's gun or in some other way.
The public school's roughly 1,600 students were later escorted off campus by police, classroom by classroom, to reunite with their parents at another high school. 
Police investigated rumors that someone was threatening to shoot people at the school last month, BayNet, a Maryland news outlet, reported on Feb. 21. The threats were unsubstantiated, but security was increased at the school, the principal said, according to BayNet.
It was unclear whether those rumors had any connection with Tuesday's violence.
""I'm not aware of anything, but again we're gonna go back and come through that as well as anybody involved (and) their social media posts,"" Cameron said in response to questions about the report.
An armed school resource officer had also been on the campus of Stoneman Douglas at the time of the shooting there, and came under criticism for failing to stop the gunman, who was armed with an AR-15 assault-style rifle. The officer, who resigned, said he had not been sure where the gunfire was coming from.
U.S. President Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association have proposed arming teachers to combat the threat of school shootings, while gun safety advocates have demanded a ban on semiautomatic rifles, among other laws.
The Maryland school is in Great Mills, a community about 70 miles (110 km) south of Washington. 

""You never think it'll be your school and then it is,"" Mollie Davis, who identified herself as a student at the school, wrote on Twitter. ""Great Mills is a wonderful school and somewhere I am proud to go. Why us?""

LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Twenty three expelled Russian diplomats and their families left London for Moscow on Tuesday as Britain and Russia traded recriminations over a nerve agent attack in England that has plunged relations into their worst crisis since the Cold War.
Prime Minister Theresa May blamed Russia for the attack on a Russian double agent and his daughter - the first known offensive use of a nerve toxin in Europe since World War Two - and gave 23 Russians whom she said were spies working under diplomatic cover one week to leave London.
Russia has repeatedly denied any involvement in the attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter and, in a reciprocal gesture on Saturday, gave 23 British diplomats a week to leave Moscow as well as closing the British Council in Russia.
As May met top officials and advisers on national security, her spokesman announced new steps to track people coming into Britain who could be deemed a threat to national security.
This was in line with an announcement by May last Wednesday that Britain would draw up new legislation to toughen defenses against ""hostile state activity"".
A state-owned Russian Ilyushin-96 plane, with ""Rossiya"" and the white, blue and red of the national flag emblazoned on the side, made a special flight from Moscow to London's Stansted airport to pick up the diplomats who were given warm-send off by Russia's top diplomat in London.
Thanking them on behalf of President Vladimir Putin, who on Sunday after his re-election repeated that Moscow had played no part in the attack, ambassador Alexander Yakovenko said: ""We are proud of you.""
Russia has refused to explain how Novichok, a nerve agent first developed by the Soviet military, was used to strike down Skripal, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who betrayed dozens of spies to Britain. 
Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter Yulia have been critically ill since they were found unconscious on a bench in the English city of Salisbury on March 4. A British policeman who was also poisoned is in a serious but stable condition.
Russia says it knows nothing about the poisoning and has repeatedly asked Britain to supply a sample of the nerve agent that was used against Skripal.
The United States and European powers say they share Britain's belief that Russia is culpable for the poisoning though they have given no indication of what they will do about it.
British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said last week that it was overwhelmingly likely that Putin himself made the decision to use the toxin against Skripal.
The two sides continued to exchange accusations over the affair.
Russian diplomats told the Conference on Disarmament at the United Nations in Geneva that Britain may have produced the toxin itself and that Moscow did not owe any explanations.
Britain's ambassador to the forum, Matthew Rowland, said Russia had given misleading statements on its Novichok program.
""Instead of engaging on the substantive concern, Russia has sought to confuse the picture with at best misleading procedural arguments,"" Rowland said. Russia was using ""a series of wild hypotheses and half truth and half lies"" to deflect attention from the truth, he said.
The Russian foreign ministry has invited foreign envoys to a meeting on March 21 with arms control experts to discuss the affair, the state-run TASS news agency reported on Tuesday.
SOVIET-ERA SCIENTIST
Putin, who was elected for a fourth term in the Kremlin on Sunday, said Russia had been falsely accused. 
""As for the tragedy that you mentioned, I found out about it from the media. The first thing that entered my head was that if it had been a military-grade nerve agent, the people would have died on the spot,"" Putin told reporters on Sunday.
""Secondly, Russia does not have such (nerve) agents. We destroyed all our chemical weapons under the supervision of international organizations, and we did it first, unlike some of our partners who promised to do it, but unfortunately did not keep their promises,"" Putin said.
A Cold War-era scientist acknowledged on Tuesday he had helped create the nerve agent, contradicting Moscow's insistence that neither Russia nor the Soviet Union ever had such a program.
However, Professor Leonid Rink told the RIA news agency that the attack did not look like Moscow's work because Skripal and his daughter had not died immediately.
""It's hard to believe that the Russians were involved, given that all of those caught up in the incident are still alive,"" he said. ""Such outrageous incompetence by the alleged (Russian) spies would have simply been laughable and unacceptable.""
Inspectors from the world's chemical weapons watchdog have begun examining the poison used in the attack.

Celebrating Newroz, the Persian New Year holiday which coincides with the spring equinox in late March, is an important marker of identity for members of Turkey's Kurdish minority.
The Turkish state has been waging a war for decades against the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast, a conflict that has intensified since a ceasefire collapsed in 2015. At the height of the PKK's insurgency in the 1990s, Newroz celebrations were marked by clashes between protesters and security forces.
Istanbul police said on Tuesday they had detained 16 members of the PKK youth wing in Turkey's biggest city on suspicion of preparing for ""pirate demonstrations"" and ""attacks"".
Another 11 people were detained in the capital Ankara for ""preparing for a provocative attack ahead of Newroz"" and police were searching for 14 more, the state-run Anadolu news agency said, describing the detainees as PKK members.
In the southeastern province of Sirnak, police detained 76 people with suspected links to the PKK, a security source said. A small pro-Kurdish party, the Democratic Regions Party, said 27 people, including one of its officials, had been detained in raids in the southern province of Hatay.
The Persian New Year festival, which is celebrated in Iran, Turkey and parts of central Asia, coincides with the spring thaw, a time when PKK fighters have previously entered Turkey from mountain hideouts in northern Iraq and violence escalated.
The PKK is considered a terrorist organization by the United States, Turkey and the European Union.
Turkey's military and its rebel allies on Sunday captured the Syrian town of Afrin, the culmination of a two-month campaign to sweep Syrian Kurdish fighters from a pocket of northwest Syria near the Turkish border. Turkey considers the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia to be an extension of the PKK.
The military incursion in Syria has been opposed by Turkey's main pro-Kurdish political party, the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), which has called on Kurds to rally in solidarity with the people of Afrin during Newroz.
President Tayyip Erdogan called for Turks to celebrate the festival in peace, during what he said was a ""sensitive period"".
Turkey has detained nearly 160,000 people, and some 152,000 state employees have been sacked or suspended, in a sweeping crackdown that followed a 2016 attempted coup, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said on Tuesday.
In a report released on Tuesday - and condemned by Ankara - the world body called on Turkey to end a state of emergency introduced after the coup, which it said has led to widespread human rights abuses.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Cold War-era scientist acknowledged on Tuesday he had helped create the nerve agent that Britain says was used to poison an ex-spy and his daughter, contradicting Moscow's insistence that neither Russia nor the Soviet Union ever had such a program.
However, Professor Leonid Rink told the RIA news agency that the attack did not look like Moscow's work because Sergei and Yulia Skripal had not died immediately.
The Skripals remain alive but in critical condition more than two weeks after they were found unconscious in the English cathedral town of Salisbury. A policeman who helped them is also in hospital in a serious condition.
Rink said he worked under the Soviet Union at a chemical weapons facility where the Novichok military-grade nerve agent was developed. Asked if he was one of Novichok's creators, he told RIA: ""Yes. It was the basis for my doctoral dissertation.""
Moscow has denied any involvement in the Skripals' case or that the Soviet Union or its successor state Russia developed Novichok at all.
Echoing a theory floated in Russian state media, Rink said the British could have been behind the attack.
""It's hard to believe that the Russians were involved, given that all of those caught up in the incident are still alive,"" he said. ""Such outrageous incompetence by the alleged (Russian) spies would have simply been laughable and unacceptable.""
Inspectors from the world's chemical weapons watchdog have begun examining the poison used in the attack which London blames on Moscow.
Rink told RIA he had worked at a Soviet chemicals weapons research facility in the town of Shikhany in Russia's Saratov Region for 27 years until the early 1990s. Novichok was not a single substance, he said, but a system of using chemical weapons and had been called 'Novichok-5' by the Soviet Union. 
""A big group of specialists in Shikhany and in Moscow worked on Novichok – on the technologies, toxicologies and biochemistry,"" he said. ""In the end we achieved very good results.""
Rink confessed to having secretly supplied a military-grade poison for cash that was used to murder a Russian banking magnate and his secretary in 1995. In a statement to investigators after his arrest, viewed by Reuters, Rink said he was in possession of poisons created as part of the chemical weapons program which he stored in his garage.
Rink received a one-year suspended prison sentence for ""misuse of powers"" after a secret trial, according to a lawyer involved in the case. 
'HEIGHT OF IDIOCY'
Rink told RIA it would have been absurd for Russian spies to have used Novichok to try to kill the Skripals because of its obviously Russian origin and Russian name. 
""There are lots of more suitable substances,"" he said. ""To fire the equivalent of a powerful rocket at someone who is not a threat and to miss would be the height of idiocy.""
He dismissed British media reports that Yulia Skripal could have unwittingly carried Novichok from Moscow as ""utter nonsense"", saying Novichok would not have survived the journey.
Once secret, Rink said the technology behind Novichok was now known to many countries including Britain, the United States and China, who he said were capable of manufacturing a version of Novichok.
However, he said the exact formula devised by the Soviet Union was unique and that it should be possible, based on a sample of the toxin used in the Salisbury attack, to say it was not ""cooked up"" in Russia. 
Another Russian scientist called Vil Mirzayanov had done a lot to publicize the formulas used to produce Novichok, Rink said.
Mirzayanov, who now lives in the United States, told Reuters this month that only the Russian government could have carried out the attack.
Rink said he knew of ""about five"" scientists familiar with the Novichok technology who had left Russia in the 1990s.
""Permission to let them leave generated great surprise in our institute,"" Rink told RIA.

(Corrects in third para to ""two weeks"" from ""three weeks"".)

Slovakia has seen its largest mass protests since the peaceful overthrow of communism almost three decades ago after investigative reporter Jan Kuciak and his fiancee were shot dead in their home last month. 
The protesters took to the streets to demand new elections and guarantees of a fair investigation into the death of Kuciak, 27, who had been investigating businessmen with political ties suspected of corruption.
Prime Minister Robert Fico resigned last week to keep the three-party government afloat. He proposed his Smer party colleague and deputy prime minister Pellegrini to lead the new cabinet.
Pellegrini presented his proposed cabinet to the president on Monday, putting forward a non-partisan official as interior minister in a bid to meet protest demands.

832,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",EU dissects Poland's defense of contested judicial reforms,"By Gabriela Baczynska and Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Germany and Denmark told Poland on Tuesday to adhere to the rule of law, as EU ministers gathered in Brussels to analyze Warsaw's defense of a court overhaul that the bloc says weakens democracy.
Poland, the biggest of the former communist EU states, stands accused of subjecting its courts to more government control since the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party won power in late 2015.
The bloc has threatened to mete out unprecedented punishment, including the 'nuclear option' of suspending Warsaw's vote, if Poland does not restore the damaged checks and balances.
""Everybody knows what is at stake here, it's very, very important that we stick to the common rules and that goes also to Poland,"" Danish Foreign Affairs Minister Anders Samuelsen told reporters on arriving at the talks in Brussels.
Samuelsen was on his way to share his analysis with EU peers after Warsaw published a 'white paper' defending the judicial changes on the grounds of improving efficiency and accountability by removing judges who prospered under post-World War Two communism in Poland, which came to an end in 1989.
After a two-year feud between Warsaw and the more liberal, western EU states, Poland's new Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has reopened dialogue with the Brussels-based EU executive European Commission on the matter.
Germany's EU minister Michael Roth said Poland, which may risk losing billions of euros in EU handouts as an indirect consequence of the dispute, must not just play for time.
""Talking for talking's sake is not enough and I hope that today... will give a clear signal that EU members support the European Commission in this essential matter,"" he said.
The Commission has given Poland until Tuesday to restore the rule of law, or risk proceedings under the so-called Article 7 punishment mechanism. Warsaw has until the end of the day to come up with its formal answer to that.
The top sanction of stripping Poland of its voting rights is all but certain not to materialize as Warsaw's ally Hungary - where the euroskeptic Prime Minister Viktor Orban has plenty of his own clashes with the EU - has vowed to block it.
But the sole fact that the EU has been debating it, albeit reluctantly, for months now causes damage to Poland's reputation and highlights its growing isolation in the EU.
The bloc lacks hard tools to force Warsaw back into line on the courts specifically.
But, as ties between Poland and the wealthier net payers to the EU's joint coffers sour, the bad blood spills over, raising the risk that they would retaliate by stripping Warsaw of some funding in bloc's the next, long-term budget from 2021.
Speaking in Warsaw on Monday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel hoped Poland's ruling nationalists would satisfy Europe's concerns.
Morawiecki responded that he hoped for a deal over the coming two months. Details, however, remain far from clear as Warsaw has given no indication it would be willing to backpedal on the contested reforms.

EDINBURGH (Reuters) - A legal attempt by anti-Brexit campaigners to establish that Britain could unilaterally reverse Brexit was given a boost on Tuesday by Scotland's top court, which said it wants to examine the case in greater depth.
The group behind the legal challenge, who include pro-EU Scottish lawmakers, want to show that Britain could stay in the European Union after all -- if, for example, the final terms of Brexit negotiated by the government were rejected by parliament.
The campaigners are ultimately seeking a formal opinion by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) asserting that Britain could reverse its decision to invoke Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty, the formal step that kickstarted the Brexit process. 
They argue that once the terms of Brexit have been negotiated, Britain's sovereign parliament may well decide not to go ahead with it, so lawmakers need to know in advance if that is legally possible.
As things stand, there is no suggestion of a change of course over Brexit, which British voters backed by 52 to 48 percent in a June 2016 referendum. The ruling Conservative Party and main opposition Labour Party are both committed to Britain leaving the European Union.
The legal case, headed by anti-Brexit campaigning lawyer Jolyon Maugham, had been rejected by a lower Scottish court. 
The British government argued that the question of whether Britain could unilaterally stop Brexit was irrelevant because the will of the voters was clear and the government was not going to back out of Brexit.
On Tuesday, the Court of Session, Scotland's highest court, overturned an earlier ruling, saying the case raised important issues and there should be a full hearing so all the arguments could be debated.
""The issue of whether it is legally possible to revoke the notice of withdrawal is, as already stated, one of great importance,"" the Court of Session said, referring to the Article 50 process which started in March 2017.
""On one view, authoritative guidance on whether it is legally possible to do so may have the capacity to influence (lawmakers) in deciding what steps to take in advance of, and at the time of, a debate and vote on the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill."" 
Once a full hearing has taken place in Edinburgh, a decision will be made on whether to refer it to the ECJ, the court said, although it may ultimately decide that it should not.
If the Scottish court decided not to refer to the ECJ, the petitioners can take their appeal to Britain's Supreme Court.

They argue that while there is no doubt that Britain could stop Brexit with the permission of the other 27 members, it should seek to establish a legal right to do so unilaterally whether the rest of the bloc likes it or not.

The date, favored by the parliament itself, is subject to final approvals but is unlikely to be altered. Legally, the five-yearly vote should have been held on June 9 but many states objected as that falls during the Pentecost holiday weekend.
May 26 is a Sunday and so as some countries traditionally vote on other days of the week the election is formally scheduled for May 23-26, 2019.
That shortens by two weeks any leeway for Britain to delay its scheduled March 29 departure from the bloc while still being out before the EU election. Lawmakers and governments have said that holding the elections while Britain was still formally an EU member would be legally complex, assuming that London would not itself want to organize a vote on the eve of Brexit.
Britain will lose its 73 seats in the chamber, with about a third of them being reallocated to other countries.
European political groups are already preparing for the EU election, with mainstream parties concerned that, as in the 2014 vote, turnout may remain low and relative support may grow for politicians hostile to the European Union.

Parliamentary groups are also pressing governments to accept that the top candidate of the winning party be appointed to run the European Commission, the EU executive, in succession to Jean-Claude Juncker. National leaders are resisting that push, insisting that they should be free to choose whomever they wish.

835,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 07:01AM ET</span>",Serbian PM threatens to resign over colleagues' 'personal vanities': state media,"BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said she may resign from the coalition government if ""personal vanities"" were not put aside, accusing her colleagues of failing to work as a team, a state-run news agency reported on Tuesday. 
Brnabic expects to discuss the possibilities of a cabinet reshuffle or resignation with President Aleksandar Vucic when he returns from Brussels later this week, Tanjug news agency quoted her as saying. 
Critics say Brnabic, who is not affiliated to any party, has little leverage within a cabinet in which most ministers come from Vucic’s Progressive Party (SNS) and the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS). 
""We will either function as a team without personal vanities and promoting of personal agendas and we will have results or I do not have to be the Prime Minister,"" Brnabic said according to Tanjug, without giving further details. 
Brnabic's office was not immediately available for comment.
Opposition deputies said Brnabic, who is not affiliated with any party, was unlikely to have any real leverage in her cabinet after Vucic nominated her in June to become Serbia's first female and openly gay prime minister. 
If Brnabic resigns, Vucic would have to nominate her replacement from the ranks of the ruling coalition or call a snap election. 
After his landslide victory in the April 2017 presidential vote, Vucic nominated Brnabic to become Serbia's first female and openly gay prime minister, but opposition politicians said at the time that she would likely have little clout in government. 
Serbia, the largest of the states to emerge from the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s, is performing a delicate balancing act between its European Union membership aspirations and a popular affinity for Russia, its huge Orthodox Christian and Slavic ally.
Upon taking office last year, Brnabic said she would make joining the EU a priority. 
Accession could tentatively happen in 2025 but Serbia must before then reform its economy, judiciary, role of law and environmental policies. 

It also needs to resolve outstanding issues with its former province Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008. The EU-sponsored dialogue between the countries has been resolved this week after two months.

The court said it had been notified by the United Nations that the Philippines formally initiated on March 17 the process to withdraw from the court. It will take one year for the move to become effective.

Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong is charged, along with an Indonesian woman, Siti Aisyah, with killing Kim Jong Nam by smearing his face with VX, a banned chemical weapon, at Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13, 2017.
Defense lawyers say the women thought they were part of a prank reality show and did not know they were handling poison. 
Hisyam Teh, Huong's lawyer, screened a closed-circuit television video recorded at Hanoi's international airport on Feb. 2, 2017, which showed her approaching a man from behind and putting her arms around his neck. 
The man was a Vietnamese government official named Trinh Ngoc Linh, Teh told the court. 
""(Linh) had given a statement to police saying that on that date, he had arrived in Hanoi from Singapore with his mother,"" Teh said, while questioning Wan Azirul Nizam, the lead police investigator in the case.
Linh would travel to Malaysia to testify if the defense needed him, Teh told reporters during a break in the hearing.
Teh also screened two videos showing Huong acting as the victim of pranks played by a Vietnamese filmmaker, Nguyen Manh Quang. 
Quang, in an affidavit submitted to the court, said he had hired Huong to act in the videos, recorded in 2016.
""These videos explain why the accused identified herself as an actress,"" Teh said, citing Huong's statement to police. 
In the statement made available to reporters, Huong said she was tricked into acting for a prank show by a man named Mr. Y, later identified as Ri Ji Hyon, one of four North Koreans who fled Malaysia on the day of the killing.
""Mr. Y is a liar. He used me to do video,"" she said.
Before the killing, Huong said, she played several pranks in Malaysia and Vietnam. 
These often involved her approaching unsuspecting men and putting her hands on their faces or kissing them on the cheek. She would then apologize before running away, she said. 
On one occasion, Ri applied ""baby cream"" on her hands and told her to put her hands on a man's face from behind, she said. 
He applied an oil-like substance on her hands on the day of the killing. 
""I don't feel anything on my hands, only sticky and oily,"" she said in the statement, adding that she had not experienced any burning or pain.
Ri told her a new actress and actor would join them for the airport prank. He described the actor as a fat and bald man with a ""black bag and jacket"", matching Kim's description on the day of his death. 
""I didn't know that the actor already died until Feb. 16, 2017, when the police told me,"" Huong said. 
Defense lawyers argue the killing was politically motivated, with many key suspects linked to the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur, suggesting the women were mere pawns. 

Kim had criticized his family's dynastic rule of North Korea, and his brother Kim Jong Un had issued orders for his execution, some South Korean officials have said.

AUSTIN/SCHERTZ, Texas (Reuters) - A package bomb blew up at a FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) distribution center near San Antonio on Tuesday, officials said, and the FBI was investigating whether it was linked to a series of four homemade bombs that hit the Texas capital of Austin this month.
Officials did not say if the latest incident was the work of what Austin police believe could be a serial bomber responsible for the four earlier devices that killed two people and injured four others.
The blast at the FedEx facility in Schertz was the fifth in the state in the last 18 days. If it is linked to the others, it would be the first outside the Austin area and the first that involves a commercial parcel service.
Police discovered another package at the same location that they believe is also loaded with an explosive device, San Antonio Police Chief Bill McManus told reporters.
""There was one other package that we believe was also loaded with an explosive device that they are looking at right now,"" McManus told reporters in Schertz, which is about 20 miles northeast of San Antonio.
The blast knocked a female employee off her feet and may have caused a concussion, McManus said. Federal officials on the scene said she had ringing in her ears and was treated and released. 
The package, filled with nails and metal shrapnel, exploded shortly after midnight local time at the facility, about 65 miles south of Austin, the San Antonio Fire Department said on Twitter.
The company described it as a FedEx Ground sorting facility. About 75 people were working at the facility at the time, fire officials said.
The individual or people behind the bombings are likely to be highly skilled and methodical, said Fred Burton, chief security officer for Stratfor, a private intelligence and security consulting firm based in Austin. 
""This is a race against time to find him before he bombs again,"" Burton said.

The bombings in Austin did not appear to be linked to terrorism, White House spokesman Sarah Sanders said on Twitter on Tuesday.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is facing his biggest political crisis since taking office more than five years ago, as suspicions swirl about a land sale to a school operator with ties to his wife.
Abe has denied that he or his wife, Akie, intervened in the heavily discounted sale of state-owned land to the school operator, Moritomo Gakuen, or that he sought to alter documents related to the deal.
Finance Minister Taro Aso, a close Abe ally, has also denied involvement in alterations officials in his ministry made to the documents.
But a spate of weekend opinion polls showed support for Abe's cabinet sinking as low as 31 percent, with majorities saying he bears some responsibility.
The sagging support could dash his hopes of winning a third three-year term as leader of the governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a September party election. A victory would put him on track to become Japan's longest-serving premier.
Below are possible scenarios for Abe's political future.
ABE'S RATINGS RECOVER, HE WINS THIRD TERM
Last year, Abe, 63, also saw his ratings plummet over the Moritomo land deal and other matters. The LDP suffered a historic trouncing in a Tokyo assembly election.
But he recovered in the polls, and his LDP-led coalition won a two-thirds ""super majority"" in a snap lower house election in October, helped by fragmentation of the opposition parties, low turnout and his stern stance toward North Korea's nuclear and missile threats.
That could happen again, especially if there are no further big revelations in the Moritomo affair, no fresh scandals appear and Abe demonstrates skill on the diplomatic front.
Abe could decide to sacrifice Aso - who has said he has no intention of resigning - but that could backfire by focusing criticism even more firmly on the prime minister and depriving him of a ""breakwater"" against public ire.
If his ratings recover and his backers in the LDP hold firm, Abe could win a third term as party leader and stay in office into 2021.
ABE RESIGNS BEFORE SEPTEMBER
If Abe's ratings fall further and stay low, he may decide to step down before the September vote, although having quit once, he is probably reluctant to do so again. Abe abruptly resigned in 2007 after a year in office plagued by scandals in his cabinet, a deadlocked parliament and poor health.
If he steps down, Abe may try to throw his support behind former foreign minister Fumio Kishida, 60, to succeed him with backing from other party heavyweights. Kishida now serves as LDP policy chief.
The LDP would have to hold a special leadership vote, but could just poll members of parliament rather than including rank-and-file members. That would give Kishida, a low-key lawmaker seen as less hawkish than Abe, an edge over former defense minister Shigeru Ishiba, who is popular with the party as a whole but less so among lawmakers.
Both Kishida and Ishiba have expressed concerns about Japan's bulging public debt.
ABE LIMPS TO SEPTEMBER
A weakened Abe could last until September, when he could step aside or run again and face a potentially fierce face-off with Ishiba.
If other rivals also throw their hats in the ring, the anti-Abe vote could be divided enough for him to eke out a victory. But if that happened, he could have trouble pushing his controversial agenda of revising the pacifist, post-war constitution and deregulating the labor market.
The election would include votes by both members of parliament and the rank-and-file, which could give Ishiba, 61, an advantage.

Internal Affairs Minister Seiko Noda, 57, has also expressed a desire to run, but is thought to have little chance of winning.

President Tayyip Erdogan declared the emergency after a failed July 2016 coup and issued more than 20 decrees which have often led to torture of detainees, impunity and interference with the judiciary, the U.N. human rights office said.
Turkey should ""promptly end the state of emergency and restore the normal functioning of institutions and the rule of law,"" it said in a report.
""The sheer number, frequency and lack of connection of several [emergency] decrees to any national threat seem to … point to the use of emergency powers to stifle any form of criticism or dissent vis-à-vis the government,"" it said.
The Turkish government blames the network of Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Muslim cleric, for the failed coup attempt during which 250 people were killed. Gulen has denied any involvement in the coup, however.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said the numbers of people arrested or dismissed are ""just staggering"".

NAIROBI (Reuters) - The world's last male northern white rhino has died, the Kenyan conservancy taking care of it said, leaving only two females of its subspecies alive in the world although scientists still hope they can save it from extinction.
Ol Pejeta Conservancy said in a statement it had made the decision with wildlife officials and his previous carers to euthanize on Monday the 45-year-old rhino, named Sudan, due to the rapid deterioration in his condition.
Sudan was being treated for age-related complications that had affected his muscles and bones and also gave him extensive skin wounds.
The rhino had spent two weeks in late February and early March lying in his pen due to discomfort from a deep wound on his right hind leg.
""His condition worsened significantly in the last 24 hours; he was unable to stand up and was suffering a great deal,"" Ol Pejeta said. ""The veterinary team from the Dver Kralove Zoo, Ol Pejeta and Kenya Wildlife Service made the decision to euthanize him.""
Sudan had previously lived at the Dver Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic before being transported to Ol Pejeta Conservancy, about 250 km (155 miles) north of Nairobi, where he lived with the last two females of the same species, 27-year-old Najin and 17-year-old Fatu.
After all attempts at getting him to mate naturally failed, conservationists last year put Sudan on dating app Tinder, hoping to raise enough money to pay for a $9 million fertility treatment.
Ol Pejeta said that they had collected Sudan's genetic material on Monday that could be used in future to attempt reproduction of northern white rhinos.
It said scientists were also seeking ways to do in vitro fertilization.
""The only hope for the preservation of this subspecies now lies in developing in vitro fertilization techniques using eggs from the two remaining females, stored northern white rhino semen from males and surrogate southern white rhino females,"" it said
While there are thousand of southern white rhinos still roaming the plains of sub-Saharan Africa, decades of rampant poaching have drastically cut numbers of northern whites.
Poachers can sell northern white rhino horns for $50,000 per kilo, making them more valuable than gold.
Kenya had 20,000 rhinos in the 1970s, falling to 400 in the 1990s. It now has 650, almost all of which are black rhinos.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A Thai anti-corruption agency is investigating the suspected misappropriation of up to 85 percent of money from a state fund for the poor in a new scandal to hit the military government, which has promised to clean up graft.
The Office of Public Sector Anti-Corruption Commission (PACC) said on Tuesday it had found evidence of irregularities amounting to about 100 million baht ($3.2 million).
""We have found that there are corrupt practices involving money destined for low-income people which the state allocates every year,"" Korntip Daroj, secretary-general of the Office of Public Sector Anti-Corruption Commission (PACC), told Reuters.
""We have investigated and found corruption-related instances and evidence in about 49 out of 76 provinces.""
The funds, which are given directly to those deemed in need in grants of up to 3,000 baht ($100), are disbursed through the Social Development and Human Security Ministry. Reuters was unable to reach officials at the ministry for comment.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who heads the junta that seized power in 2014, said he had ordered the dismissal of all those involved in misappropriating funds and called for an investigation by the ministry.
Prayuth told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the government had always been stringent about corruption.
""I don't want you to think that it has become worse,"" he said. 
The latest investigation comes as Prayuth's deputy, Prawit Wongsuwan, is under investigation for failing to declare among his assets a collection of luxury watches.
That has partly fueled recent protests calling for an end to military rule, with elections set for February 2019 after repeated delays.
The junta took power in the name of ridding Thailand of corruption as well as ending a decade-long political deadlock between rival factions, but government critics say it has failed to tackle a culture of impunity for the rich and powerful.
Thailand ranked 96 out of 180 countries in Transparency International's Corruptions Perceptions Index 2017, a slight improvement from 2016.

Korntip said the fraud over the fund for the poor was allegedly committed by faking copies of national identification cards. It was later found that money never reached the intended recipients, he said.

847,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Faced with Delhi's pollution, India's federal agencies bought air purifiers","By Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - As pollution choked India's capital Delhi in recent years, a total of 140 air purifiers were purchased for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's offices and at least six other government agencies, according to previously unpublished government data.
The purchases came as Modi faced criticism for not taking effective steps to improve air quality in Delhi, one of the world's most polluted cities.
Delhi's chief minister, who belongs to an opposition party, called the city a ""gas chamber"" last year as levels of airborne PM 2.5, tiny particulate matter that can reach deep into the lungs, far exceeded levels classified as ""hazardous."" 
A British medical journal, The Lancet, has estimated air pollution was responsible for almost 10 percent of the total disease burden in India in 2016.
Each year, when pollution levels shoot up in the winter months, the capital's schools are often forced to shut. Last year, all schools in the city were closed for five days.
A federal body that manages more than 45 government schools in the capital said it had made no purchases of air purifiers and had no plans to do so.
""Offices are generally air conditioned, so air purifiers will function. Our schools aren't air conditioned, windows are open, so air purifiers won't make a difference,"" said Santosh Kumar Mall, commissioner of the body, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan.
The World Health Organization has recommended keeping windows closed when air pollution is high. It also says air conditioners should not be used if they draw air from the outside.
Asked if any steps were taken to safeguard school students from Delhi's dirty air, Mall told Reuters: ""I don't think so, when pollution increased a lot, our schools were shut"".
The federal government, however, spent 3.6 million rupees, or about $55,000, to buy air purifiers for Modi's offices and at least six federal departments between 2014 and 2017, according to government data reviewed by Reuters. 
Besides Modi's offices inside parliament house, the agencies included federal economic planning think tank NITI Aayog and the ministries of health, agriculture, tourism, home affairs and foreign affairs.
""This initiative is like giving gumboots to city officials when the drainage system collapses and the city is covered in muck,"" said Oommen C. Kurian, a health researcher at the New Delhi-based think tank Observer Research Foundation. ""This is just not the response we are looking for.""
A government spokesman directed questions on the subject to the federal environment ministry, which did not respond to a request for comment. 
Modi's office and the six departments for which data was available did not respond to Reuters' queries.
SALES BOOM
Air purifiers are devices which use filters to reduce indoor air pollutants. Such machines are beyond the means of most people in India, where the annual per capita income was $1,709 in 2016, according to the World Bank.
Still, air purifier sales have been surging in Delhi, a city of more than 20 million people. The sale of such units at Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's India website grew by more than 3.5 times in 2017 over the previous year, the company said.
The home ministry spent about $20,000 in the last three years to buy 44 of the devices, while Modi's parliament house offices accounted for 25 units which cost about $11,000, the data showed. 
NITI Aayog, which also spent about $11,000 on air purifiers, said the devices were ""issued to officers at the level of joint secretary & equivalent and above, as per their requests"", according to a right to information response reviewed by Reuters.
A senior government official familiar with Modi's pollution-control planning said there was no federal policy allowing officials to buy air purifiers and such purchases were made only if departments received requests from bureaucrats.
""Ideally, no one should need air purifiers and we're trying our best to ensure that,"" the official said, referring to the government's attempts to improve air quality in Delhi. 
After years of criticism that Modi's government was not doing enough, this year's federal budget outlined a scheme for pollution control that will include spending $177 million on reducing crop residue burning - one of the main causes of pollution. 
Modi's environment minister last month said pollution was ""now linked to our national image.""

848,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 12:26PM ET</span>",Former French president Sarkozy held over Gaddafi cash inquiry,"By Brian Love and Emmanuel Jarry
PARIS (Reuters) - Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was questioned on Tuesday by police investigating whether late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi helped finance his 2007 election campaign.
An official in the French judiciary said Sarkozy, 63, was held in custody in Nanterre, west of Paris.
It is the second major judicial investigation to fall on Sarkozy, who served as president from 2007-2012. He already faces trial on separate charges of illicit spending overruns during his failed re-election campaign in 2012.
A lawyer for Sarkozy could not immediately be reached for comment. The former president has dismissed the Libya allegations as ""grotesque"" and a ""crude manipulation"".
France's center-right party, The Republicans, backed its former leader. ""Members and supporters of The Republicans are once again left feeling that not all lawmakers or former lawmakers are treated equally, depending on their political affiliation,"" the party said in a statement.
France opened an inquiry into the Libya case in 2013, after reports by French website Mediapart based on claims by a Franco-Lebanese businessman, Ziad Takieddine, who said he had transferred 5 million euros ($6 million) from Gaddafi's former intelligence chief Abdullah Senussi to Sarkozy's campaign chief. 
Months after he took office in 2007, Sarkozy became the first Western leader in decades to host a visit by Gaddafi, who pitched his trademark Bedouin-style tent next to the Elysee Palace. Several business deals were signed.
However, Sarkozy was later one of the chief advocates of a NATO-led military campaign that resulted in Gaddafi's overthrow and killing at the hands of rebel forces in 2011.
CAMPAIGN FINANCES
Investigators in France can hold people for questioning for up to 48 hours before either releasing them or sending them before magistrates who decide whether they have grounds for turning a preliminary inquiry into a full investigation.
The latter can, but does not always, lead to a trial.
The Libya-funding inquiry appeared to have gone quiet until January, when French businessman Alexandre Djouhri, suspected by investigators of funneling money from Gaddafi to finance Sarkozy's campaign, was arrested in Britain on a warrant issued by France.
A lawyer for Djouhri last month accused French authorities of politicizing the case and manipulating it against his client. French authorities had no comment.
Sarkozy’s predecessor, Jacques Chirac, was convicted in 2011, after his retirement, of misusing public funds to keep political allies in phantom jobs. That made the now ailing Chirac the first French head of state convicted since Nazi collaborator Marshal Philippe Petain in 1945.
Sarkozy has been dogged for years by political scandals, but none has led to a conviction.
The Libya inquiry has largely focused on the evidence provided by Takieddine, who is himself under investigation in a separate affair of arms sales to Pakistan in the 1990s.
Takieddine said in 2016 that he personally handed over three suitcases filled with cash from Gaddafi to Sarkozy and a senior aide to help finance Sarkozy's campaign.

Sarkozy's lawyer at the time, Thierry Herzog, dismissed Takieddine's claims and produced a copy of a witness statement to police by Takieddine in 2012 in which the businessman said he had last seen Sarkozy in November 2003.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A group of South Korea's K-pop singers will visit Pyongyang from March 31, the South said on Tuesday, a reciprocal visit after North Korea sent performers to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
The South Koreans, numbering about 160, will visit North Korea until April 3, the South's Ministry of Unification said in a statement, for the first such performances in more than a decade.
The group will include K-pop girl group Red Velvet and music industry veterans Cho Yong-pil and Lee Sun-hee, the ministry said, after talks on the performances between the neighbors' delegations at the truce border village of Panmunjom.
Cho was the last South Korean singer to perform in the North, at a concert in Pyongyang in 2005.
""While we're on the stage, I believe it will be difficult to portray personal feelings towards denuclearization,"" said singer and record producer Yoon Sang, who led the South's delegation at Tuesday's talks.
""Our first task will be to instill the same awe in North Korean audiences as we do our South Korean ones and make sure nothing is awkward,"" he told a media briefing.
Further negotiations, such as deciding the songs to be performed, would be done in written form, he added.
The visitors will hold two shows in Pyongyang, one at the East Pyongyang Grand Theatre, which was the backdrop to a landmark performance by the New York Philharmonic in 2008.
The other show will be held at the Ryukyung Chung Ju Yung Gymnasium, which was a joint project between North and South, named after Hyundai Group founder Chung Ju-yung. 
Officials will visit the North from March 22 to 24 to inspect the sites and ensure they can accommodate the singers, the ministry added. 
The deal is the latest step in the detente that began after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said at the beginning of the year that he intended to improve ties.

North Korea has since agreed to hold summits with the South and the United States, apart from participating last month in the Olympics in South Korea.

850,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>","Maldives to lift state of emergency, charge ex-president, chief justice with bribery","By Shihar Aneez and Ranga Sirilal
COLOMBO (Reuters) - Maldives President Abdulla Yameen will lift a 45-day state of emergency on Thursday and the government will bring bribery charges against former leader Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and the chief justice, said a senior Maldives diplomat.
Yameen imposed a state of emergency on Feb. 5 for 15 days to annul a Feb. 1 Supreme Court ruling that quashed convictions against nine opposition leaders and ordered his government to free those held in prison. He later extended the state of emergency for another 30 days with parliament approval, a move challenged by the opposition.
Under the emergency, Yameen's administration arrested former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, the chief justice, another Supreme Court judge, and a Supreme Court administrator on allegations of attempting to overthrow the government. They have all rejected the charges.
""Unless something unusual happens, we should not have emergency by Thursday,"" Mohamed Hussain Shareef, Maldives Ambassador for Sri Lanka told a Foreign Correspondents Association forum on Monday.
""The government has no intention of extending it any further barring very unusual circumstances like widespread violence. The intention is to do away with this state of emergency when the current 30 day period expires on March 22.""
Shareef said bribery charges against Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed and Supreme Court Judge Ali Hameed have been sent to the prosecutor general and that bribery charges will also be brought against former president Gayoom and Supreme Court administrator Hassan Sayeed.
""That is definite. We know that charges will be pressed against the four of them,” Shareef said.
Gayoom is accused of bribing the three legal professionals to overthrow the Yameen government. 
Despite opposition claims that hundreds of people have been arrested under the state of emergency, Shareef said only 38 had been arrested so far while others were ""detained and released"".
Maldives police told Reuters on Saturday that at least 139 opposition protesters were arrested as they attempted to defy orders under the state of emergency and march into the high security zone in capital Male.
When asked if any foreign agent or country had a role in the Maldives crisis, Shareef said: ""For my knowledge, the investigations at the moment are focused on local actors only"". 
Rights group Amnesty International has said the Maldivian government was using the emergency ""as a license for repression, targeting members of civil society, judges and political opponents"".
Yameen's government retains a majority in parliament in the absence of the opposition's 12 MPs who were stripped of their seats by Yameen's party for defecting last year.

851,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 03:40AM ET</span>",Supreme Court mulls California law on anti-abortion facilities,"By Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday tackles a dispute over whether a California law requiring Christian-based facilities that counsel pregnant women against abortion to post signs disclosing the availability of state-subsidized abortions and birth control violates their right to free speech.
The nine justices are set to hear an hour of arguments in an appeal by a group of non-profit facilities called crisis pregnancy centers of a lower court ruling upholding the Democratic-backed 2015 law.
The case represents a crossroads of two contentious issues: abortion and the breadth of the right to freedom of speech under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment. The Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973, and the wider issue of abortion rights is not at issue in the case.
Crisis pregnancy centers say they offer legitimate health services but that it is their mission to steer women with unplanned pregnancies away from abortion. They accuse California of forcing them to advertise for abortion even though they oppose it.
California says some crisis pregnancy centers mislead women by presenting themselves as full-service reproductive healthcare facilities and the law helps ensure these clients are made aware of abortion services available elsewhere. 
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the law in 2016 after it was challenged by some of these facilities, finding the statute did not discriminate based on viewpoint. 
California's Reproductive FACT Act, passed by a Democratic-led legislature and signed by Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, requires centers licensed as family planning facilities to post or distribute notices that the state has programs offering free or low-cost birth control and abortion services. The law requires unlicensed facilities with no medical provider on staff to disclose that fact.
Abortion rights advocates say the roughly 2,700 U.S. anti-abortion pregnancy centers, including around 200 in California, far outnumber facilities providing abortions.
The California challengers are the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, an umbrella group for crisis pregnancy centers, and two such facilities in San Diego County. The plaintiffs had told the lower courts that they would not comply with the law.
A win for them could make it harder for Democratic-governed states to impose rules on crisis pregnancy centers, but also could help abortion rights advocates challenge laws in Republican-governed states that impose certain requirements on abortion clinics. 
California said its law does not force crisis pregnancy centers to refer women for abortions, nor does it prevent them from voicing their views on abortion. The state told the justices in legal papers that some centers use incomplete or false medical advice to try to prevent women from having an abortion. Some resemble medical clinics, down to lab coats worn by staff, to try to confuse women into thinking they are at a center offering all options, the state added.
The facilities deny using deceptive tactics.
A ruling is due by the end of June.

In fighting that lasted 24 hours, the ultra-hardline militant group killed 36 Syrian soldiers, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Syrian army could not immediately be reached for comment.
The district of al-Qadam lies in the Syrian capital's southern suburbs and has not been part of the month-long offensive waged by the army against rebels in eastern Ghouta. 
It is located next to the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp, a scene of fierce fighting early in the seven-year conflict. 
Last week, rebels that had held part of Qadam for years quit the district for opposition areas in northern Syria under an evacuation deal with the government, allowing the army to move in. 
However, the Islamic State group that had held a separate part of Qadam, and had sporadically fought the rebels there, launched an assault to take the area they had vacated. 
Islamic State has lost almost all its territory in Syria after two rival offensives last year by the Syrian army, backed by Russia and Iran, and an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias backed by the United States. 
It now controls only the small pocket in Qadam, a patch of territory in southwest Syria near the borders with Jordan and Israel, and two small areas of desert on each side of the Euphrates near the border with Iraq.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Justice Minister Sylvi Listhaug quit on Tuesday to avert a collapse of the minority government after she caused uproar with comments accusing the opposition of being too lenient on terrorism suspects.
Listhaug had been poised to lose a vote of confidence in parliament later on Tuesday over her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) postings that could have toppled the government. Her decision to resign defused Norway's worst political crisis in years.
""The choice (to resign) was mine alone, and I've done what I believe was right,"" Listhaug told a news conference, adding that the process had been ""a witch hunt"" against her.
Listhaug, of the Progress Party, provoked outrage earlier this month after she accused the opposition Labour Party of putting ""terrorists' rights"" before national security, a particularly sensitive topic for Labour which was hit in 2011 by a mass shooting by far right militant Anders Behring Breivik.
Listhaug made her comments after Labour and the Christian Democrats helped defeat a bill allowing the state the right, without judicial review, to strip individuals of Norwegian citizenship if they were suspected of terrorism or of joining foreign militant groups.
She apologized in parliament last week for causing a political storm. Opposition parties, however, said her gesture was not sincere enough, and that she should resign. 
Norway's opposition Christian Democrats said on Monday it would join five center-left parties in backing a no-confidence motion, securing a majority in favor of ousting Listhaug.
The vote in parliament had been scheduled to take place later on Tuesday.
Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg faced the choice of letting Listhaug go, weakening the cabinet and risking a defection by her Progress Party allies, or to get the whole government to resign.
Listhaug ""told me late last night that she wanted to resign,"" Solberg told a news conference, adding that Listhaug could potentially make a comeback in the cabinet at some point.
""The important thing for me is that the Progress Party remains in government, Listhaug said.
She lashed out at Labour and the Christian Democrats, arguing they were not sufficiently tolerant of free speech when they sought her dismissal.
""The national debate has been turned into something of a kindergarten dispute,"" Listhaug said.
""I don't want to change. I see this as an attempt to gag the debate. I will continue to pursue the fight from parliament,"" she added.
Norway does not allow snap elections, and while Solberg might have been able to form a new government, the task could also have fallen to opposition Labour leader Jonas Gahr Stoere.

""My goal here is to keep Stoere out of the prime minister's office,"" Listhaug said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Two Syrian asylum seekers on Tuesday lost a bid to overturn a government decision to deny them refugee status, in the first such lawsuit in Japan since civil war erupted in the Middle Eastern state in 2011.
The Tokyo District Court upheld a government ruling made five years ago, that the pair's bid for asylum was not admissible under international refugee law.
""The world understands the Syrian situation - it's getting worse. But the Japanese court hasn't understood that at all,"" one of the plaintiffs, Joude Youssef, told a news conference.
Speaking in Arabic through a Japanese interpreter, Youssef said he planned to appeal the court's decision. 
The second asylum seeker was not at the news conference.
Lawyers said Youssef had the right to stay in Japan, under a humanitarian status that allows residency but not full refugee rights. It was not clear if the second plaintiff would appeal.
Immigration and asylum are sensitive subjects in Japan, where many pride themselves on cultural and ethnic homogeneity even amid a shrinking population and the worst labor shortage since the 1970s.
Youssef, a Kurd from the north of Syria, had applied for asylum in Japan in 2012, after saying he was persecuted for organizing pro-democracy demonstrations. 
The Japanese government rejected the claim a year later, saying he lacked proof of his involvement in protests in Syria.
The second plaintiff had claimed asylum after refusing military service in Syria. 
Although a major donor to international aid organizations, Japan has remained reluctant to take in refugees. 
It accepted only 20 last year, with a record 19,628 people applying for asylum.
Japan has said the majority of those seeking asylum do so for economic reasons. In January it limited asylum seekers' right to work, as it looks to stamp out what it calls the abuse of the asylum system.
More than 5.4 million people have fled from Syria since 2011, according to the U.N. refugee agency, with most seeking safety in other Middle Eastern countries and Europe. 
Some 81 Syrians have sought asylum in Japan during that period, with only 12 awarded refugee status, the Justice Ministry said. Another 56 have been allowed to stay for humanitarian reasons.

856,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>","China, not North Korea, to dominate Japan military planning","By Tim Kelly and Nobuhiro Kubo
TOKYO (Reuters) - North Korea's growing missile arsenal might be the most obvious and immediate military threat facing Japan, but defense planners in Tokyo are focused on a much larger and more challenging foe as they prepare for the years ahead.
China has stepped up military spending and already dominates the South China Sea, through which Japan's trade with major markets including Europe and the Middle East flows. 
Now, Japanese military experts are worried Beijing may be on the brink of opening access to the Pacific through a Japanese island chain that has marked the limit of China's military influence for decades.
Tokyo sees unfettered passage for Chinese warships and warplanes through the Okinawan island chain as a threat to vital sea lanes. For China that access is part and parcel of becoming a global superpower.
""Now, we are evenly matched but the reality Japan faces is that it is becoming the underdog,"" said Nozomu Yoshitomi, a professor at Nihon University in Tokyo who advised Japan's government as a Self Defence Forces military analyst. 
CHINESE AMBITION
In addition to having Asia's second-largest military, Japan is also defended by U.S. forces that have used the country as their main Asia base since the end of World War Two. Under a security treaty, Washington is obliged to aid Tokyo if its territory is attacked. 
China has ""essentially established de facto control over the South China Sea and the East China Sea is next,"" said a retired senior U.S. military commander on condition he wasn't identified. ""The United States, for its part, has been in relative retreat in the Western Pacific for a decade.""
Beijing is ramping up military spending to build a world-class fighting force by 2050 with advanced kit, including stealth jets and, according to state-run media, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. 
In 2018, Beijing plans to spend 1.11 trillion yuan ($175 billion) on its armed forces, more than three times as much as Japan.
That would also be around a third of what the United States pays for the world's most powerful military, including 30,000 marines in Okinawa and a navy carrier attack group based near Tokyo.
“The pace of Chinese activity in waters around Japanese territory has expanded and accelerated,"" Japan's Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera said this month. ""China is building the capacity to operate in distant seas and that can be see with China’s acquisition of its first carrier and its construction of a second flat top.” 
China says its military is for defensive purposes and its intentions in the region are peaceful. China's Defence Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
HUNKER DOWN
Japan's defense outlays for the past five years have risen by just 1 percent a year. It will likely grow at around the same pace over the next five year plan as health and welfare spending on an aging population takes priority, a government defense official said. 
""Finance is our weakness, but our strength is the resilience of our society,"" said another defense ministry adviser, who also asked not to be identified. If Japan is able to hunker down long enough, he explained, the threat from China should recede as future internal strife, economic woes or other events prompt a retreat. 
To restrain Beijing in the meantime, Japan needs advanced weaponry and new munitions able to strike targets further away, said the sources with knowledge of the plans. 
Japan's defense reviews, which will likely be released in December, may propose it establish its first joint command headquarters to coordinate air, ground and naval forces and strengthen cooperation with Washington, the sources said.
New equipment may include amphibious ships along with aerial drones to monitor Chinese activity and potentially target missiles in the boost phase of any launch.
Japan's military will get new air and ground missiles able to hit shipping and land targets at greater ranges. It will also place fresh orders for  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) F-35 stealth fighters including vertical take off and landing versions, the sources said. 
The review will lay out plans to train more Ground Self Defence troops (GSDF) in marine fighting tactics and for their wider deployment to Okinawa. The GSDF's unit there will grow to division strength from a battalion, said former defense minister Gen Nakatani. 
CHINESE PRESSURE
Yet as Tokyo formulates those plans, Beijing is already testing Japanese defenses. 
In a maneuver in January that Japan protested as a ""serious escalation"", a Chinese submarine entered waters contiguous to disputed islands in the East China Sea claimed as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. 
That followed a series of longer range sorties by People's Liberation Army Air Force bombers and fighters.
China can ""test the readiness and response of Japanese forces, to better understand Japanese defenses, and, over time, to engage in peacetime attrition,"" said Toshi Yoshihara, a professor and Senior Fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington. ""If Chinese operations become routine, they force Japan to accept the PLA’s growing presence as a fact of life.""
Tokyo was especially alarmed in November when six Xian H-6 bombers flew through a 290 km (180 mile) gap in Japan's island chain between Okinawa and Miyakojima, accompanied by an electronic warfare TU-154 and a Y-8 monitoring plane.
One senior defense official said the exercise ""looked like a practice strike package on Guam"", another major U.S. military base.
China's Defence Ministry did not respond to request for comment on the exercise.

""The pace of Chinese activity is faster than we anticipated,"" Nakatani said at his Tokyo office, where an arrow scribbled on a map of Japan on the wall highlighted the breach in the island chain. ""Japan's security environment has not been this harsh since World War Two.""

Abe's support ratings have dropped sharply since the finance ministry said it had altered records relating to a discounted sale of state-owned land to school operator Moritomo Gakuen, which had ties to Abe's wife, Akie Abe.
Opposition lawmakers have been calling for Sagawa, who headed the division that submitted the documents before he became tax agency chief in July, to testify in parliament. Sagawa resigned this month. 
Abe and Finance Minister Taro Aso have both denied wrongdoing.
But opposition parties are calling for Aso to resign, while the affair could dash Abe's hopes of winning a third three-year term as head of his Liberal Democratic Party in a September party leadership election.

Cambodia, a conservative Buddhist country, is frequented by young tourists backpacking through Southeast Asia.
Daniel Jones, who was tried on Thursday in the Siem Reap provincial court, was among 10 foreigners the police detained in a Jan. 25 raid on the event, called ""Pub Crawl or Let's Get Wet"".
Authorities said the group danced provocatively at a pool party and posted pictures of themselves dancing on social media.
Judge Um Chan Thol ordered Jones to serve just one month and 22 days of his one-year sentence, calling his act of producing pornography ""unintentional"".
""The accused said he unintentionally produced pornography that affects Khmer culture,"" the judge said while reading his verdict, referring to Cambodia.
Jones had denied producing pornography.
""There was no evidence against my client,"" said his lawyer, Ouch Sopheaktra. ""As a lawyer, I am not happy with this decision.""
The court had dropped charges against the other nine foreigners and deported them.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Mark Kingon was appointed acting head of South Africa's tax office on Tuesday, hours after President Cyril Ramaphosa suspended his predecessor and days before a Moody's review that could see the country lose its last investment-grade credit rating.
The move was seen as a signal of intent to ratings agencies and investors that had lost faith in Africa's most developed economy under former leader Jacob Zuma. It follows a cabinet reshuffle which sacked or demoted several allies of Zuma, who was forced to step down by the ruling ANC last month. 
Ramaphosa suspended Zuma-appointed Tom Moyane late on Tuesday, saying he had failed as head of the South African Revenue Service (SARS) and had lost the confidence of taxpayers.
Kingon, SARS chief officer for business and individual taxes, was announced as acting commissioner on Tuesday.
Mindful that investors who finance its big budget and current account deficits have lost confidence in South Africa, Ramaphosa has begun to reform the economy and state-owned companies like power utility Eskom and South African Airways.
A test of whether his early changes have helped shift sentiment will come on Friday when credit rating agency Moody's completes a review that could see it downgrade South Africa's local and foreign debt to ""junk"" status.
""This (Moyane's suspension) is a clear sign to Moody's that strong steps are being taken to turn financial institutions around,"" said Joon Chong, partner in Webber Wentzel’s Tax Practice. ""We may avoid a downgrade by the skin of our teeth.""
Rating agencies Fitch and S&P both demoted South Africa from investment-grade last year as economic growth slowed and public finances deteriorated.
Moyane, who was appointed in 2014, had been criticized by SARS employees and members of the ruling African National Congress after the tax agency missed revenue collection targets and faced allegations of corruption and mismanagement.
In last month's budget the Treasury said it faced a 48.2 billion rand ($4 billion) revenue gap in the current 2017/18 fiscal year, partly due to SARS missing its collection target.
Moyane was not available for comment on Tuesday. He has repeatedly defended his record and had the support of Zuma. 
But Ramaphosa said he had lost faith in his leadership. 

""The disrepute in which you have brought the SARS and the government as a whole and the risk to the national Revenue Fund are enormous,"" Ramaphosa said in a March 19 letter informing Moyane of his suspension that was seen by Reuters.

861,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 05:19AM ET</span>",Saudi Prince Alwaleed reached secret agreement with government: BBG TV,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the chairman of Kingdom Holding who spent nearly three months in detention in the kingdom's anti-corruption campaign, told Bloomberg TV he had reached an agreement with the government for his release.
The prince declined to disclose the details of his ""confirmed understanding"" with authorities in the interview, which aired on Tuesday, but said it was easy to verify that he still held a 95 percent stake in his global investment firm.
""When I say it is a confidential and secret agreement, an arrangement that is based on a confirmed understanding between me and government of Saudi Arabia, I have to respect that,"" he said. The process with the government was ongoing, he said.
The prince also said he was in talks with the country's emerging sovereign wealth fund about co-investments in domestic projects, and that Kingdom Holding was looking at splitting its $13 billion of assets by spinning off some holdings.
Prince Alwaleed, Saudi Arabia's most recognized business figure, was freed on Jan. 27 after being held at Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton, along with scores of royals, senior officials and businessmen, on the orders of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Most detainees were released after reaching financial settlements that netted just over $100 billion for the state, the attorney general has said, without providing details.
In an interview at Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton conducted hours before his release, Prince Alwaleed told Reuters he maintained his innocence and expected to keep full control of his firm. 
A senior Saudi official would not confirm that claim but said any settlements included an admission of guilt.
In the absence of more information, speculation has run rampant about whether Prince Alwaleed secured his freedom by forfeiting part of his fortune - estimated by Forbes magazine at $17 billion - or stood up to authorities and won.
'BUSINESS AS USUAL'
Prince Alwaleed told Bloomberg he would continue to invest in Saudi Arabia and that he held no ill will towards his uncle King Salman and his cousin Prince Mohammed.
""It's business as usual,"" he said.
The prince said he was in discussions with the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which is chaired by the crown prince, about making joint investments inside the kingdom.
Those talks began before his detention at the Ritz-Carlton and focused around putting his Four Seasons hotels in the PIF's Red Sea Project on the west coast and entertainment district outside the capital, he said.
The prince said he was open to considering investments in NEOM, the PIF's planned futuristic $500 billion city in Saudi Arabia's northwest corner, once its basic infrastructure was in place.
Asked about plans to restructure his firm, the prince said Kingdom Holding was planning to split its $13 billion of assets by spinning off its domestic property and other holdings. 
""It will take some time as we are still developing that matter,"" he said. 

The prince said he was working with advisers, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), to look for investments as large as $3 billion for Kingdom. The company is ""on the verge"" of getting between $1 billion and $2 billion in financing facilities, he said.

The shootings, which occurred in areas not generally marred by gun violence, were the latest incidents to weigh on the security record of the Mexican capital.
Mexico City has tended to be less affected by the lawlessness plaguing sizeable stretches of the country.
A spokeswoman for Mexico City Attorney General Edmundo Garrido said the Spaniard, Jose Gonzalez, died in hospital after being shot around 9:30 p.m. on Saturday in the northwestern borough of Miguel Hidalgo.
In a statement, the office of the attorney general said the man was shot outside one of his businesses, in a part of the borough known as Escandon, a normally peaceful area.
The motive for the shooting was under investigation, according to the spokeswoman. It was also unclear how many people took part in the attack on Gonzalez, she said.
Spanish newspapers, including El Pais, said Gonzalez had interests in hotels and gas stations.
El Pais said Gonzalez was a friend of some prominent Mexican entrepreneurs and that he customarily spent part of the year in his native Galicia in Spain, and part of it Mexico.
Separately, a man embroiled in a child custody dispute shot the mother of his daughter, then turned the gun on himself in the high-rise shopping center and residential complex known as Reforma 222 in central Mexico City, local police said.
The man went into a footwear shop where the woman was working on Monday afternoon and shot her in the abdomen before shooting himself in the head, police said in a statement.
The woman, 28, later died of her injuries, the office of the Mexico City attorney general said on Twitter.
The complex is a landmark on Paseo de la Reforma, one of the city's principal thoroughfares, and includes foreign diplomatic officials among its residents. 

Killings in Mexico hit a record high in 2017, and the violence has sapped confidence in the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto. His ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party faces an uphill battle to secure re-election in July.

865,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 08:27AM ET</span>",Xi warns Taiwan will face 'punishment of history' for separatism,"By Philip Wen and Ben Blanchard
BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping told self-ruled Taiwan on Tuesday that it would face the ""punishment of history"" for any attempt at separatism, offering his strongest warning yet to the island claimed by China as its sacred territory.
In response, the government of Taiwan, one of China's most sensitive issues and a potentially dangerous military flashpoint, said it hoped China could ""break free"" of the old clichés of threats and force.
China's hostility toward Taiwan has risen since the 2016 election of President Tsai Ing-wen, a member of the island's pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party.
China suspects Tsai wants to push for formal independence, which would cross a red line for Communist Party leaders in Beijing, though Tsai has said she wants to maintain the status quo and is committed to ensuring peace.
China has been infuriated by U.S. President Donald Trump's signing into law legislation last week that encourages the United States to send senior officials to Taiwan to meet Taiwan counterparts, and vice versa.
The United States does not have formal ties with Taiwan but is required by law to help it with self-defense and is the island's primary source of weapons.
China will push for the ""peaceful reunification of the motherland"" and work for more Taiwanese to enjoy the opportunities of its development, Xi told the 3,000-odd delegates to the annual session of parliament. 
""It is a shared aspiration of all Chinese people and in their basic interests to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and realize China's complete reunification,"" Xi said in a speech at the end of the session.
""Any actions and tricks to split China are doomed to failure and will meet with the people's condemnation and the punishment of history,"" he added, to loud applause.
China had the will, confidence and ability to defeat any separatist activity, Xi said.
""The Chinese people share a common belief that it is never allowed and it is absolutely impossible to separate any inch of our great country's territory from China.""
In Taiwan, the China policy-making Mainland Affairs Council said the government was firm in its conviction to protect Taiwan's ""sovereign dignity"" and the well-being of its people.
""We also hope that mainland China's leaders, at this time of entering into a new administration period, can break free of clichéd thinking of strong intimidation,"" it added.
In a visit likely to further irritate China, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Alex Wong will be in Taiwan this week, the island's foreign ministry said. 
PATRIOTIC SPIRIT
China has also been worried about independence activists in the former British colony of Hong Kong following big street protests there in 2014 calling for universal suffrage.
Xi said China would uphold Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy, but would also seek to increase ""national consciousness and patriotic spirit"" in the financial center. 
Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by China, and has accused China of not understanding how democracy works, pointing out that Taiwan's people have the right to decide its future.
The new U.S. law on Taiwan adds to strains between China and the United States over trade, as Trump has enacted tariffs and called for China to reduce its huge trade imbalance with the United States, even while Washington has sought Beijing's help to resolve tension with North Korea.
Taiwan has thanked the United States for the law and its support, but its foreign ministry said on Monday there were no plans for any senior leaders, such as the president, to visit the United States.
While stepped-up Chinese military exercises around Taiwan over the past year have rattled the island, Xi reiterated China's assertion that its rise was not a threat to any country, though China considers Taiwan to be merely a Chinese province not a nation. 

""Only those who are in the habit of threatening others will see everyone else as a threat,"" Xi said.

866,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 10:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. advancing toward first Guantanamo repatriation under Trump,"By Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is advancing toward the first transfer of a prisoner from the Guantanamo Bay detention center under U.S. President Donald Trump, the U.S. military told Reuters on Monday, a move that would repatriate the detainee to Saudi Arabia.
The transfer of 43-year-old Ahmed Muhammed Haza al-Darbi appeared to have stalled in February, when he became eligible but was not repatriated, as allowed under the terms of al-Darbi's 2014 plea bargain agreement. 
The U.S. military said at the time it was waiting for assurances from Saudi Arabia's government to move forward on his departure. 
On Monday, the Pentagon suggested that process was back on track. Navy Commander Sarah Higgins, a spokeswoman, said the Defense Department was ""reviewing information received from Saudi Arabia regarding al-Darbi's transfer.""
""The transfer process is moving forward,"" Higgins said. ""I have no further information on transfer timing.""
She did not elaborate.
Al-Darbi's transfer would decrease the prisoner population at the detention center in Cuba to 40 from 41 - despite Trump's campaign pledge to ""to load it up with some bad dudes.""
The prison, which was opened by Republican President George W. Bush to hold terrorism suspects captured overseas after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks came to symbolize harsh detention practices that opened the United States to accusations of torture.
U.S. officials have not ruled out again adding to the prisoner population and have acknowledged trouble repatriating Islamic State fighters being held by U.S.-backed forces in Syria, raising the possibility that Guantanamo Bay could be seen as a viable option in the future.
The news of progress in al-Darbi's case came before a high-profile trip to Washington by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, his first visit to the United States as Saudi heir apparent. 
The crown prince is due to meet Trump at the White House on Tuesday, in a visit that is expected to see both countries publicly emphasize their strong security ties, even as those ties come under intensifying scrutiny in Congress. 
'MESSAGE OF HOPE'
Al-Darbi became eligible for repatriation under the terms of his 2014 plea bargain agreement, in which he admitted to his role in a 2002 attack of against a French-flagged oil tanker off the coast of Yemen, and agreed to cooperate with U.S. authorities. He has been held at Guantanamo Bay for 15 years.
Ramzi Kassem, a law professor at the City University of New York who has been al-Darbi's lead defense counsel since 2008, told Reuters that a Trump administration move to honor the 2014 agreement would be significant and would be noticed by other inmates.
""Mr. Darbi's transfer to Saudi custody would send a qualified message of hope to other prisoners that leaving Guantanamo is possible,"" Kassem said.
He said the message was qualified in part because ""the U.S. government has no interest in prosecuting three quarters of the detainees left today,"" which would make them ineligible for such agreements. 
Critics of the U.S. military detention system say that militants can be best prosecuted in civilian courts and have seized on the high costs of housing inmates at Guantanamo Bay as one argument why indefinite detention is misguided.
Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, reduced the inmate population to 41 from 242, but fell short of fulfilling his promise to close the jail before leaving office last year.
Trump signed an order in January to keep the Guantanamo Bay detention center open and hinted in his State of the Union address to Congress that Islamic State or al Qaeda fighters could be added to the prison population 
Trump also asked the Pentagon to re-examine the U.S. military's detention policy.
The U.S. military has long struggled with what to do about prisoners of war in an open-ended battle against Islamist extremism, in which militants have come from all corners of the world to fight in places like Syria.
In February, U.S. officials expressed concerns about the lack of a clear path on how to deal with foreign fighters for Islamic State who were detained by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces.

U.S. officials say there are hundreds of foreign fighters and thousands of Syrian Islamic State militants in SDF hands.

""I wish a beautiful and blessed Nowruz to the millions of people around the world who are celebrating the arrival of spring,"" Trump said. He added, however, that the Iranian people were burdened by ""rulers who serve themselves instead of serving the people."" 
Trump, who has threatened to pull Washington out of a multilateral deal with Tehran to curb its nuclear program, called the Revolutionary Guard ""a hostile army that brutalizes and steals from the Iranian people to fund terrorism abroad.""
Trump said in the statement the Guard had spent more than $16 billion to prop up Syria's government and support militants and terrorists in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.
He also accused the group of impoverishing Iran's people, damaging its environment and suppressing civil rights.
The harsh language contrasted with Trump's Nowruz statement last year, which made no mention of politics.
In January, Trump delivered an ultimatum to the European signatories of the 2015 nuclear accord, which aimed to curb Iran's nuclear program in return for lifting various trade and economic sanctions.
The Republican president said they must agree to ""fix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear deal,"" which was agreed to under his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, or he would refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief on Iran. U.S. sanctions will resume unless Trump issues new ""waivers"" to suspend them on May 12.
Iran has said that if Washington pulls out of the deal, it will no longer abide by its terms.
In a bid to persuade Washington to remain in the nuclear accord, France urged the European Union on Monday to consider new sanctions on Iran over its involvement in Syria's civil war and its ballistic missile program.
Nowruz is Iran's most important national event and is celebrated with family gatherings, vacations and gift-giving. It is also celebrated by millions around the world, including in Turkey, Iraq and parts of South and Central Asia.

868,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 12:22AM ET</span>",U.S.-South Korea military exercises to resume next month,"By Hyonhee Shin and Idrees Ali
SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and South Korea will resume joint military drills next month, Seoul and Washington said on Tuesday, exercises that will go ahead despite U.S. President Donald Trump's planned meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Seoul and Washington said in January they would delay the annual exercises until after the Winter Olympics and Paralympics held in South Korea last month, helping to create conditions for a resumption of talks between South and North Korea.
The reclusive North routinely denounces the drills as preparation for war.
The Foal Eagle field exercise is scheduled to begin on April 1 and go on for a month, while the computer-simulated Key Resolve will be held for two weeks starting in mid-April, a South Korean military official told reporters in Seoul on Tuesday. 
There has been a flurry of diplomatic activity across Asia, the United States and Europe since the North sent delegations to the Winter Olympics, moves that culminated in North Korea's planned summits with the South and with the United States.
The South Korean and U.S. militaries usually stage the two drills in March for about two months but the period of this year's field exercise was cut by half, mainly due to the Olympics, said the South Korean official, who asked not to be identified.
The exercises will be of a ""scale similar to that of the previous years"" and are meant ""to improve our readiness against various North Korean threats"", the official said.
North Korea is pursuing nuclear and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.
Such plans, and the exchange of insults between Kim and Trump, had led to increased fears of confrontation on the Korean peninsula in recent months before the diplomatic contacts. China, North Korea's main ally, says it is happy to see an easing of tensions. 
'DEFENCE-ORIENTED'
The Pentagon said the North Korean military had been notified about the schedule for the drills by the United Nations Command.
""Our combined exercises are defence-oriented and there is no reason for North Korea to view them as a provocation,"" Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Logan said in a statement.
The South Korean official said consultations were underway over whether U.S. strategic assets such as nuclear-powered aircraft carriers or bombers would be deployed for the drills.
Logan said the two joint drills would involve about 23,700 U.S. troops and 300,000 South Korean forces. 
He said they were not in response to any specific North Korean actions or the current situation on the Korean peninsula. 
The Key Resolve simulated exercises would likely overlap with a summit between the two Koreas, planned for late April, the South Korean official said.
After the postponement of the drills was announced in January, Pyongyang agreed to hold the first official talks with Seoul in more than two years and then sent athletes and officials to the Winter Olympics.
Those talks led to a visit this month by a South Korean delegation to Pyongyang for a meeting with the North Korean leader. Delegation leader Chung Eui-yong, South Korea's national security adviser, said Kim committed to denuclearization and expressed eagerness to meet Trump as soon as possible, an offer the U.S. president quickly accepted. 
Chung said Kim was expected to meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April before meeting Trump by the end of May. 
The two Koreas held working-level talks on Tuesday at the border village of Panmunjom over Seoul's plan to send an artistic troupe for a concert in Pyongyang. 
Despite the North's denunciation of past drills, Chung said Kim understood that the allies must continue their ""routine"" joint military exercises.
Pyongyang has not confirmed the exchange and threatened earlier this month to take ""counteraction"" if the United States and South Korea went ahead with the exercises. 

The joint drills ran from March 1-April 30 in 2017 and included the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said no U.S. aircraft carriers would take part this year, which he said was according to plan and not related to the political situation.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria's capital Vienna once again defended its position as the city offering the best quality of life in the world, while Iraq's capital Baghdad remains the worst in an annual survey from consulting firm Mercer.
Mercer's survey of 231 cities helps companies and organizations determine compensation and hardship allowances for international staff. Its criteria include political stability, health care, education, crime, recreation and transport.
Europe has eight of the world's top 10 most pleasant cities: Germany and Switzerland each have three cities in the top 10, while New Zealand, Canada and Australia each have one.
With a population of 1.8 million, Vienna topped the survey for the ninth year in a row, boasting a vibrant cultural scene, comprehensive healthcare and moderate housing costs. 
Vienna is followed by Switzerland's Zurich and then New Zealand's Auckland and Germany's Munich in joint third.
Vancouver, ranked fifth, offers the best quality of living in North America. Singapore at 25 and Montevideo at 77 topped the Asian and Latin American places. The best African entry on the list was South Africa's Durban in 89th place.
A year before Britain is expected to leave the European Union, its highest ranked city, London, fell one rank to 41 in an annual comparison.
""Cities in the UK continue to rank highly for quality of living, and remain attractive destinations for multinationals and their employees,"" said Kate Fitzpatrick, Mercer's Global Mobility Practice Leader for Britain and Ireland. 
Over the past 20 years, living standards increased the most in some eastern European cities such as Sarajevo, now at 159, and Bratislava, at 80, the report said.
""As a result of increased living standards, a competitive labor market and talent availability, many of these cities have started attracting multinational businesses setting up new operations,"" said Martine Ferland, President Europe and Pacific.
Baghdad has been at the bottom of the list for a decade now. Waves of sectarian violence have swept through the city since the American-led invasion in 2003. 

Yemen's capital Sanaa, devastated by conflict, ranked two places above Baghdad, and Syria's Damascus, seven years into a civil war, ranked six places above Iraq's capital.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker elevated Martin Selmayr, a 47-year-old German, to be secretary-general of the EU body last month, triggering accusations from Brexit campaigner and MEP Nigel Farage of nepotism, from others about a lack of transparency and complaints to the European Ombudsman.

Juncker, whose five-year term ends in October next year, has defended the appointment as one he and his 27 fellow commissioners are entitled to make, as well as on the basis of Selmayr's capabilities. 
However, diplomats say member states have begun to worry that the issue was becoming an unwelcome distraction and could even fuel eurosceptics before EU elections next year.

AFRIN, Syria (Reuters) - A day after Turkish troops and their Syrian rebel allies seized control of Afrin, a Turkish aid group started distributing relief supplies in the town center on Monday, but residents continued to leave after widespread reports of looting.
Triumphant Syrian rebel fighters stood on a fallen statue, firing shots in the air, while military vehicles patrolled streets still littered with the debris from Turkey's eight-week offensive to drive out Kurdish YPG fighters.
Shops were closed and some people left for villages outside Afrin, the main town in a pocket of Kurdish-controlled territory in northwest Syria. One resident said the Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army rebel fighters who swept into Afrin on Sunday morning had been looting shops and homes. 
""The Free Syrian Army came and entered into Afrin and supposedly we were going to be safe. But it turned out to be the opposite,"" said the man, who did not give his name. 
""The Free Syrian Army looted our cars, looted our houses, looted our shops. It has become like we are all homeless (even) in our houses. No food, no drink, no security.""
Syria's foreign ministry, in a letter to the United Nations published by state media, said Afrin residents' belongings were looted and their houses destroyed in the Turkey-led campaign.
An FSA spokesman in the region was not immediately available for comment.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's spokesman said Ankara was taking reports of looting in Afrin seriously. ""We are looking into the incidents. Apparently they have happened. Some groups apparently did not follow the orders that were given by their commanders,"" Ibrahim Kalin told CNN.
Another man in Afrin, loading mattresses, carpets and other goods onto the back of a tractor trailer, said his family moved to the town from Bulbul, 30 km (20 miles) away, when Turkey launched its air and ground offensive in January. 
""The bombardment started so we fled to Afrin. Now we are returning from Afrin to our home because it's safer,"" he said.
The United Nations said two thirds of 323,000 residents had fled the wider Afrin region since the start of Turkey's campaign to drive out Kurdish YPG fighters, who it says are an extension of Kurdish militants waging a prolonged insurgency in southern Turkey.
It appealed for urgent supplies to ""stem the catastrophic situation"" for tens of thousands of people in Afrin and in Ghouta, where Syrian government forces are fighting to crush the last major rebel-held enclave on the edge of the capital.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) called on Monday for greater access to the civilian population of Afrin, saying that Turkey's Red Crescent lacked credibility among the Syrian Kurds after the Turkish military operation.
Turkey, however, has promised to support people in Afrin and on Monday its emergency relief agency AFAD was distributing aid in the center of the town. 
""Since yesterday when the Turkish Army and Free Syrian Army entered here our duty started for the humanitarian affairs,"" said AFAD's director Mehmed Gulluoglu.

""Today we are here for need assessment and also for the first distribution. We are distributing food, hygiene kits and some prepared food and some blankets any case.""

RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Monday called the U.S. ambassador to Israel a ""son of a dog"" because of his support for Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank.
Abbas, speaking at a Palestinian leadership gathering, also blamed Hamas for a bomb attack last week on the convoy of Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah in Gaza, remarks that threatened reconciliation efforts with the Islamist group.
The Palestinian leader accused Ambassador David Friedman of defending Israeli settlers in the West Bank by saying that they were building on ""their land"". The slur drew rebukes from the diplomat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
In an angry tone, Abbas said: ""The son of dog says they build on their land? He is a settler, and his family are settlers, and he is the U.S. ambassador in Tel Aviv. What should we expect from him?""
Friedman, a strong supporter of Israel's settler movement, was an early and enthusiastic advocate of U.S. President Donald Trump's Dec. 6 decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital and to move the U.S. embassy there.
Friedman responded during a speech in Jerusalem to a conference on combating global anti-Semitism, saying: ""His response was to refer to me as son of a dog. Anti-Semitism or political discourse? Not for me to judge, I leave that all up to you.""
U.S. Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt issued a statement calling Abbas' comment ""highly inappropriate."" He said the Palestinian leader needed ""to choose between hateful rhetoric and concrete and practical efforts to improve the quality of life of his people.""
Trump's announcement on Jerusalem delighted the Israeli government but infuriated Palestinians, who have staged regular protests since then.
Israel regards Jerusalem as its eternal and indivisible capital, although that is not recognised internationally. Palestinians feel equally strongly, saying that East Jerusalem must be the capital of a future Palestinian state.
Peace talks aimed at finding a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict have stalled, while Israeli settlement expansion has continued.
Netanyahu said Trump's decisions on Jerusalem appeared to have brought Abbas to the point of making a verbal attacks on a U.S. official. 
""For the first time in decades, the U.S. administration has stopped spoiling the Palestinian leaders and tells them: enough is enough,"" Netanyahu said on Twitter. ""Apparently the shock of the truth has caused them to lose it.""
BLAME FOR BOMBING
Addressing the rancour between Hamas and Fatah, Abbas said there had been ""zero"" progress in reconciliation, citing efforts to bring a power-sharing deal to bear on the crossings out of the Gaza Strip and on security within the enclave.
Relations have grown even worse since Hamdallah and Palestinian security chief Majid Faraj's convoy was attacked by a roadside bomb in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip on March 13. They were uninjured.
""We congratulate the two big brothers (Hamdallah and Faraj) that they are safe after the sinful and despicable attack that was carried out against them by the Hamas movement in the Gaza Strip,"" Abbas said. 
He offered no evidence of Hamas' involvement but said he did not trust Hamas to investigate the incident honestly.
""We do not want investigation from them, we do not want information from them and we do not want anything from them because we know exactly that they, the Hamas movement, were the ones who committed this incident,"" he said.
Abbas said Hamas would have to give up control of Gaza or risk taking full responsibility for the enclave and its two million residents without any help from his Western-backed Palestinian Authority. 
""In my capacity as the president of the Palestinian people I have tolerated much in order to regain unity and unite the homeland and I was met with rejection by Hamas and their illegitimate authority,"" he said.
Hamas called his comments irresponsible and said they aimed to ""burn bridges and reinforce divisions."" The group has previously denied involvement in the bombing.

Fatah and Hamas have tried for years to come to an accommodation over running the Gaza Strip, but have repeatedly failed to implement deals mainly brokered by Egypt.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Hungary defended its anti-immigration stance on Monday at the United Nations, saying it was determined to maintain a homogeneous, Christian society.
The U.N. Committee on Civil and Political Rights, composed of independent experts, began a two-day review of Hungary's record, less than three weeks before a parliamentary election.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban told a rally last Thursday that voters must fight ""external forces and international powers"" who wanted to foist mass immigration on their country.
Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told the panel: ""First and foremost, it is a firm conviction of the government that the Hungarian people have the right to live a life in security, without fear of terrorist atrocities."" 
In 2015, Hungary had a ""sad experience"" when some 400,000 migrants passed through on their way to western Europe, ""ignoring all rules"", he said. 
Hungary responded with a border fence and rejection of European Union proposals to settle migrants in member states under a quota system. Most of the migrants were Muslims fleeing conflict in the Middle East.
""The Hungarian government has not admitted illegal migrants and will not admit them in future,"" Szijjarto said.
""We Hungarians have lived the past 1,000 years in a Christian society, in an integrated, homogenous society; that is what we consider invaluable, and we continue to insist on this.""
He said non-governmental organizations that lobby for more tolerance of immigration were not elected and did not represent the Hungarian people.

The Liberal government, which will deliver the 2018-19 budget on March 28, said their focus includes the reduction of wait times for health care, providing more services for seniors choosing to stay at home and making investments in mental health and addictions services.
Finance Minister Charles Sousa said earlier this month that the government will run a deficit in 2018-19 of up to C$8 billion. The government has forecast a surplus in 2017-18.

""There is also an epidemic of sexual violence, most of it unreported and unaddressed, and much of it against children,"" said Mark Lowcock in a statement to the U.N. Security Council.
A long-delayed election to replace President Joseph Kabila is at the root of violence that has ravaged the Central African country. Earlier on Monday, the UN condemned an ""unlawful and unjustified"" crackdown by Congolese security forces on anti-government protests that killed at least 47 people in the year to January 2018.
About 2.2 million people became internally displaced in the DRC last year alone, nearly doubling the total number of internally displaced people to 4.5 million. 
With some 13 million people needing humanitarian assistance, more than 4.6 million acutely malnourished children and the worst outbreak of cholera in 15 years, Lowcock said about $1.7 billion is needed this year for humanitarian programs in the DRC, nearly four times what was secured in 2017.
Lowcock asked for ""immediate and substantial financial contributions"" ahead of the first high-level humanitarian conference on the DRC to be held in Geneva on April 13.
""Underfunding is the largest single impediment to the humanitarian response in the DRC,"" Lowcock said, adding that without a halt to the violence and a successful political transition the crisis will continue to escalate.

ROME (Reuters) - Pope Francis branded exploitation of women for prostitution a ""crime against humanity"" on Monday and asked forgiveness from society for Catholic men who use prostitutes.
The pope made his frank comments in a remarkable, freewheeling question-and-answer session with young people from around the world who came to Rome to prepare for a bishops' meeting scheduled for October at the Vatican.
Blessing Okoedion, a 32-year-old Nigerian who was once a victim of human sexual trafficking, told the pope she was troubled that many clients of prostitutes on the streets of Rome were Catholic.
""I ask myself and I ask you, is it possible for a Church that is still too male chauvinist to be able to question itself truthfully about this high demand by clients?"" she said.
Francis responded that in Italy it was likely that some 90 percent of male clients of prostitutes were baptized Catholics.
""I would like to take advantage of this moment to ask forgiveness from you (exploited women) and society for all the Catholics who carry out this criminal act,"" he said.
""I think of the disgust these girls must feel when men make them do these things,"" he added.
Prostitutes, most of them victims of human trafficking from Nigeria, other African countries and Eastern Europe, are found at night on the streets of Rome's periphery and around parks.
At the meeting with the some 300 delegates at a university in Rome, Francis said sexual exploitation of women stemmed from a ""sick mentality"" embedded in many people. He added that feminism had still not be able to remove it and asked the young people to fight against it.
""(It says) women are to be exploited in one way or another. And that is what explains this ... it is a sickness of humanity, a sickness of looking at society in a certain way, a crime against humanity,"" he said.
Francis rejected the idea that going to prostitutes could be considered harmless.
""Who does this is a criminal. This is not making love, this is torturing a woman. Let's not confuse terms. This is criminal, a sick mentality,"" he said.
Francis also heard some tough talk from Angela Markas, 22, of Australia. ""There is a tendency in the Church to avoid matters that are not-so-easy to talk about. This includes same-sex marriage, our sexuality, and also, the role of women in the Church,"" she told the pope.

Earlier this month, Catholic women led by former Irish president Mary McAleese demanded a greater decision-making role for women in the Church, urging the pope to tear down its ""walls of misogyny"". [L5N1QQ5ZN]

BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Slovakia's ruling party sought on Monday to avert an election by offering the job of Interior Minister to a non-partisan official, to investigate the murder of a journalist whose death caused a crisis that brought down Prime Minister Robert Fico.
Fico, head of the ruling Smer party and prime minister for 10 of the last 12 years, resigned last week in the face of the biggest anti-government demonstrations since the fall of Communism in 1989, triggered by the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak, 27, who was investigating government corruption.
Fico's choice for successor, long-time ally Peter Pellegrini, was due to meet President Andrej Kiska later on Monday to propose a new cabinet.
Thousands of Slovaks have taken to the streets to demand an investigation and new elections since Kuciak and his fiancee were shot dead in their home last month.
Kiska, whose role as president is otherwise largely ceremonial, must decide whether to accept a proposal for a new government of the Smer-led coalition, or call a new election.
Pellegrini, a deputy prime minister under Fico, said the new interior minister in charge of law and order would be Jozef Raz, a political independent who now serves as chief of staff at the Health Ministry.
Kiska has backed protesters' demand to sideline Fico's close ally Robert Kalinak, who has run the Interior Ministry in all three Fico-led governments, to guarantee a thorough investigation of the murder.
""I believe I am going to the president with nominations that should not raise any aversion,"" Pellegrini told a news conference after a Smer leadership meeting.
""We decided to pick a non-partisan (for the Interior Ministry). That gives us a chance that he will not be just an expert, but will also bring calm in these complicated times and not raise suspicions of pushing someone's party interests.""
""If we proposed the best candidate that would be a Smer party member, it would raise passions and it would be a handicap even if it was the best candidate we had.""
Raz studied economics and law. He has led the Defence Ministry's acquisition and organization departments and served as a manager at the state-owned postal service prior to joining the Health Ministry in 2016.

LONDON (Reuters) - A London couple murdered their French nanny and burnt her body in their garden after holding her captive and accusing her of crimes she had not committed, a British court heard on Monday. 
Mother-of-two Sabrina Kouider, 35, and her partner Ouissem Medouni, 40, both French nationals, stand accused of murdering 21-year-old Sophie Lionnet. They deny the charge. 
Prosecutor Richard Horwell told a jury at London's Old Bailey criminal court that after killing Lionnet, the pair had planned to dispose of her body by cremating it in the garden of their flat in the well-to-do Wimbledon area of south London. 
They planned to explain her disappearance by saying she had left their employment under a cloud and as far as they knew had returned to France. 
But Horwell said the ""wicked plan"" was frustrated by a neighbor who became concerned about the fire. Firefighters were called and found Lionnet's remains under the ashes. 
Horwell said that during Lionnet's time in the Wimbledon flat, she had not been paid, had been beaten, and had not been given enough to eat. 
Kouider had made a series of accusations against the young nanny, including that she was colluding with the father of one of the children to allow him to sexually abuse the family. 
""Sophie had a great desire to please, even in adversity, and if she did not have the strength to walk out of this horrendous household, as she plainly did not, she must have found this increasingly toxic situation wholly outside her experience and ability to manage,"" Horwell said. 
Horwell said none of the accusations were true, but Lionnet was so badly treated and so weak that she sometimes made confessions. 
He told the jury that Kouider was ""vindictive, overbearing and controlling"" while Lionnet was ""timid, uncomplaining and especially vulnerable to manipulation and threats"".
The trial, expected to last five weeks, continues.

Ties between the African countries have appeared to fray in recent months, as Cairo grew restless over a Sudan-Turkey naval agreement and a dispute over a dam Ethiopia is building on the Nile river that runs through all three countries.
Sudan last year banned imports of all Egyptian agricultural goods, a move analysts saw as largely political and tied to a litany of Sudanese grievances, chief among them disputed land in Egypt's south.
Sudan recalled its ambassador to Egypt in January without explanation, but allowed him to return earlier this month.
On Monday both leaders agreed to strengthen ties and work together to bolster trade, military and energy cooperation, though the trade spat was not mentioned.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Abdel Fattah al-Sisi needs no election campaign. The general-turned-president's crackdown on challengers and dissent, which critics say surpasses that before Egypt's 2011 uprising, has already ensured he will win a second term.
Central Cairo is nonetheless adorned with banners and billboards proclaiming support for Sisi, who led the overthrow of Egypt's first freely elected president in 2013 and returned the military establishment to power.
Next Monday, seven years after the Arab Spring protests that ousted Egypt's Hosni Mubarak and others in the Middle East, Egypt will once again hold the kind of vote that kept those leaders in power for decades.
Voters have two choices: Sisi, or a second, barely known candidate who backs Sisi. The election commission says the vote will be free and fair.
For activists who led the 2011 protests demanding accountability and free and fair elections, next week's vote shows how those hopes have been dashed.
""There's no meaning to the election ... people aren't interested in it,"" human rights campaigner Laila Soueif, 61, said by phone. The vote is simply a way for Sisi to show he is ""well and truly in control"", she said.
Sisi has supporters. Those who will turn out to re-elect the former field marshal for another four years hope he can restore security and improve the economy of the most populous Arab country by crushing Islamist militants and seeing through austerity measures.
In downtown Cairo, posters showing the president standing at podiums, wearing a hard hat and looking through binoculars read: ""Sisi for stability"" and ""to eradicate terrorism"".
Opponents, however, say his presidency has brought Egypt's toughest crackdown on dissent and freedoms, while his popularity has eroded as the economic reforms, including a steep currency devaluation, have left most Egyptians worse off.
""In terms of oppression ... it's worse than the days of Mubarak,"" Soueif said.
DISSENT SILENCED
In the months before the vote, two prominent former military men made surprise announcements that they would run against Sisi, with indications from the street that their bids might be popular.
One of them, ex-military chief of staff Sami Anan, was arrested in January, accused of illegally running for public office, and remains detained. The other, former air force commander and prime minister Ahmed Shafik, dropped his presidential bid after reports he had been detained at a hotel. 
One of Anan's top campaign managers was beaten and hospitalized, accusing authorities of being behind his assault, and another former presidential candidate was arrested. All other serious opposition pulled out of the race citing intimidation.
Rights groups say authorities have also cracked down on media ahead of the vote in a bid to silence criticism.
The United Nations rights chief this month expressed concern over a ""climate of intimidation"", and urged much greater respect for Egyptians' fundamental freedoms and rights.
Sisi's campaign spokesman this week said the government had not prevented any candidate from running.
But after opposition withdrawals the only other choice for voters, Moussa Mostafa Moussa, supports Sisi and hopes the incumbent will win.
Moussa has little support and his campaigning has been half-hearted. At one Cairo square, there are nearly 40 banners of Sisi, and two of Moussa - one obscured behind an image of the president.
SECURITY, ECONOMIC CHALLENGES AHEAD
Although almost certain to win, Sisi faces big challenges after the vote: an ailing economy with a fast-growing population of nearly 100 million, and a stubborn insurgency by Islamic State fighters trying to destabilize the country.
The military is battling jihadists in a conflict that has driven residents from their homes in impoverished areas of Egypt's northern Sinai Peninsula.
The biggest concern for most Egyptians, however, is the economy and unemployment. Although overall unemployment fell below 12 percent last year, a quarter of Egypt's swelling youth are jobless, according to the central statistics office.
Even Egyptians with jobs have seen their spending power slashed after austerity measures tied to a $12 billion International Monetary Fund loan.
As people feel the pinch, Sisi has pressed on with massive infrastructure projects such as an expansion of the Suez Canal and a new capital being built east of Cairo, with none of the promised financial relief yet filtering down. 
""It's got so expensive,"" retired civil servant Ahmed, 62, said outside a Cairo metro station. ""I get a 1,200 pound ($60) pension, half of which goes on utilities.""
""They (authorities) go on about GDP growth and so on, but what good are those figures and what's the point of big projects if people can't afford anything?""
Ahmed, who gave only his first name fearing reprisals by authorities, said he would not bother voting.
""It's a referendum, not an election. The rest of the world must be laughing at us. We want a civilian president, not a military one.""
MILITARY BACK IN CHARGE
Sisi's overthrow of president Mohamed Mursi of the now banned Muslim Brotherhood in 2013 put a former armed forces chief in charge of Egypt once again. Senior military officers have dominated Egypt's politics and much of its economy for decades.
Analysts say the military's role is more overt than it has been in the past.
""What's different about today is how 'out front' it (the military) is"" in its role in the economy, said HA Hellyer, senior nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council.
As authorities keep thousands of suspected Islamists behind bars and courts hand down death sentences, Mubarak-era officials accused of corruption and killings have under Sisi been released or had cases against them dropped.
Nationalism encouraged by the military has accompanied the build-up to the election. An army official recently told journalists at a briefing near Cairo not to ""harm your nation"" by publishing news not from state outlets.
In the 2014 election, Sisi won 96.91 percent of the vote, with turnout of about 47 percent of 54 million voters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia called the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers a ""flawed agreement"" on Monday, on the eve of a meeting between the Saudi crown prince and U.S. President Donald Trump who have both been highly critical of Iran.
""Our view of the nuclear deal is that it's a flawed agreement,"" Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told reporters in Washington.
The meeting between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Trump comes at a time when Riyadh and Washington have been strengthening their relationship after tensions under the previous U.S. administration, in part over Iran.
Jubeir called out Iran for what Riyadh has long slammed as Tehran's destabilizing behavior in the region.
""We've called for tougher policies towards Iran for years,"" Jubeir said.
""We're looking at ways in which we can push back against Iran's nefarious activities in the region,"" Jubeir said, lambasting Tehran's support for the Houthi militia in Yemen and support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.
Iran denies interference in the region's affairs.
Saudi Arabia had viewed with unease the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama, whom they felt considered Riyadh’s alliance with Washington less important than negotiating the Iran nuclear deal.
Saudi state news agency SPA said the crown prince left for the United States on Monday to begin the visit, which is also expected to include meetings with business leaders and stops in New York, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Houston.
It is first visit by Mohammed bin Salman, or MbS as he known in Western circles, to the United States since he became heir apparent.
The ambitious young prince, has embarked on reforms to modernize deeply conservative Saudi Arabia. 
He visited Britain earlier this month on his first foreign tour since his rise as part of efforts to persuade Western allies that ""shock"" reforms have made his country, the world's top oil exporter, a better place to invest and a more tolerant society.
He will meet Trump on Tuesday at the White House as well as senior administration officials. The crown prince is also due to meet with members of Congress, some of whom have been critical of the Saudi campaign in Yemen, particularly the humanitarian situation and civilian casualties.
In his meetings with business, industry and entertainment leaders, the prince is aiming to cultivate investments and political support. Several dozen Saudi chief executives are expected to join him in touting investment opportunities in the kingdom.
Jubeir said he would meet with executives in the oil and gas industry in Houston. He added that Riyadh would look to sign memorandums of understanding, without providing additional details. 
The crown prince will have meetings at Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT). He will also participate in a Saudi-U.S. CEO forum in New York and will meet with U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres.
Jubeir lauded the U.S.-Saudi relationship at an ""all time high."" 
Any visit to the New York Stock Exchange will be watched closely by investors because of the potentially lucrative listing of up to 5 percent of Saudi Aramco expected later this year.
Sources close to the process said the kingdom is increasingly looking to just float the oil giant locally as plans for an initial public offering on an international exchange such as New York or London appear to be receding.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said recently that Aramco was too important to risk listing in the United States because of litigation concerns, such as existing lawsuits against rival oil companies for their role in climate change.
Prince Mohammed has won Western plaudits for seeking to ease Saudi Arabia's reliance on oil, tackle chronic corruption and transform the Sunni Muslim kingdom. 
But the severity and secrecy of an anti-corruption crackdown
last November, after Prince Mohammed was named heir to the throne, has unnerved some investors.
The crown prince is also likely to reiterate to Washington the view of Saudi Arabia that its regional arch-rival, Iran, should not be trusted given its nuclear program.
Under a deal reached with major powers including the United States in 2015, Tehran curbed its enrichment of uranium for nuclear fuel, a process that can also yield atomic bombs, in exchange for a removal of tough international sanctions.

Trump delivered an ultimatum to the European powers on Jan. 12, saying they must agree to “fix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear deal” or he would refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief on Iran that it calls for.

About 1,300 psychiatric patients were shifted from a unit of the Life Healthcare Group to charities as part of cost-cutting measures by Gauteng's health department, sparking public outrage.
Retired Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke, who headed an inquiry into the deaths, ruled on Monday that the Gauteng provincial government - which oversees the capital Pretoria and economic hub Johannesburg - had violated the constitutional rights of the patients who died under its custody.
Moseneke said the provincial government's actions were ""unjustified and reckless"" and he ordered compensation be paid to the family members of the patients. However, he said there was also proof of irregular expenditure or fraud in the decision to move the patients to unregistered facilities.
Lawyers for the Gauteng health department had offered a settlement of 200,000 rand ($16,573), arguing the compensation be limited to common law damages, which would have excluded compensation for the violation of the patients' rights.
South Africa's health ombudsman reported in early 2017 that at least 94 psychiatric patients died of negligence after their move to unregistered facilities, but said that number could rise as more people were coming forward with information. 
Experts say mental health care has taken a backseat in funding and public hospitals lack sufficient equipment or staff.

893,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 10:21AM ET</span>",Thousands flock to auction of vehicles owned by Saudi tycoon,"By Marwa Rashad
DAMMAM, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Thousands of people attended the first day of an auction of vehicles owned by indebted Saudi Arabian tycoon Maan al-Sanea and his company, a sale which officials say will go towards repaying about 18 billion riyals ($4.8 billion) owed to creditors.
Authorities say the auction, the subject of huge interest in the Eastern Province where his business is based, reflects their focus on improving corporate governance and by extension Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s commitment to economic reforms. 
Creditors ranging from unpaid workers to local and international banks hope the process, which at a later stage will include sale of bigger assets such as property, will lead to repayment of at least part of their debt.
The businessman, ranked in 2007 by Forbes as one of the world's 100 richest people, was detained by authorities late last year for unpaid debt dating back to 2009 when his company, Saad Group, defaulted on payments in what was Saudi Arabia’s biggest financial meltdown.
His case is separate from the dozens of Saudi businessmen and prominent figures who have been held in a corruption crackdown, although the dispute touches on similar investor concerns about Saudi corporate governance.
A three-judge tribunal established in 2016 to resolve Saad's debt dispute late last year appointed a consortium called Etqaan Alliance to liquidate assets owned by the billionaire.
The first phase of the auction was launched this week, with around 900 vehicles including trucks, buses, diggers, forklift trucks and golf carts, owned by Saad Group, based in the city of Khobar, going under the hammer.
Later stages of the process will include other parts of his business empire and personal wealth including property - estimated at around 10.3 billion riyals, as well as machinery, ceramics and furniture in auctions in the Eastern Province, Riyadh, Jeddah and Yanbu, said Abdulaziz al-Rashid, head of Etqaan Alliance, a coalition of companies including two real estate companies, accountants and lawyers. 
After a series of TV, online and billboard adverts run by Etqaan Alliance in recent weeks anticipation about the auction has been building.
Roads around the auction site were jammed on Sunday afternoon as people queued to enter the dusty land plot where the event was taking place.
""Can you believe this man was once a billionaire and today he came to the ground level and has to start from scratch?,” said a buyer of a forklift truck, giving his first name as Nasser.
DUBAI MEETING 
Prospective buyers were mainly businessmen from local construction companies and other contractors. 
""This auction gives a clear message that the court is serious to carry out the liquidation process of all assets to repay creditors,"" said al-Rashid. ""We expect to finalize liquidation of all assets during this year.""
Money raised from the first phase of the auction, expected to be completed by the end of April, will go towards repaying creditors owed around 18 billion riyals, he said.
A further 30 billion riyals of debt claims hadn't been processed by the court yet, he said.
Other people familiar with the sale process said the assets to be auctioned under the first phase were expected to cover around 10 to 15 percent of the 18 billion riyals in claims so far recognized by the court.
Priority for the repayment would first go to repaying unpaid workers, some of whom haven't been paid for more than a year. Vendors and other companies owed money would be given next priority, with banks at a later stage, the people said.
Some of the workers who hope to get paid through the liquidation process were among those attending the event. 
Outside the court process, advisers to Saad Group recently asked some bank creditors to meet in Dubai in a bid to try to reach a consensual debt settlement on 16 billion riyals of claims, Reuters reported last week.
The advisers were seeking a deal before Saudi authorities make progress in the auction process.
The people familiar with the auction process said that the legal procedures were on track and would not be affected by any possible settlement Saad Group reaches with its creditors.

CARACAS (Reuters) - An Argentine-Venezuelan rights lawyer became the latest activist to escape detention by President Nicolas Maduro's government and flee Venezuela over the weekend.
""I am so happy to be free, but so sad for what's left behind,"" Marcelo Crovato, 51, told Reuters after reaching Colombia from where he was flying to Argentina later on Monday.
Crovato was detained at his Caracas home in 2014 while working for a rights group defending young protesters during a wave of demonstrations against Maduro's socialist government. Forty-three people were killed and thousands were injured during the unrest. 
He spent 10 months at a prison where he had once served as director, before being granted house arrest.
Speaking by telephone from Colombia, Crovato declined to give full details of his escape for fear of retaliation against friends or relatives by Venezuelan intelligence agents.
""I was planning it for months after I concluded there was no possibility of justice in Venezuela,"" Crovato said.
""It was an incredible sensation crossing the border. I kept telling myself 'I'm invisible, I'm like a ghost passing through, they won't stop me'. When I saw the 'welcome to Colombia' sign, my eyes welled up and I thought 'I did it!'"" he said. 
The lawyer was due to fly to Buenos Aires with his wife and two young sons who left Venezuela before him. 
He has Argentine nationality via his father, and was hoping to meet President Mauricio Macri, one of the region's fiercest critics of Maduro over rights and democracy. 
The Venezuelan government did not respond to a request for comment on Crovato's case. Critics say Maduro has turned Venezuela into a dictatorship, while he accuses foes of plotting with the United States to overthrow him and seize the nation's oil.
Crovato's departure was the latest in a trickle of escapes by detained activists. Prominent opposition leader Antonio Ledezma fled to Spain via Colombia in November and former opposition mayor David Smolansky settled in the United States the same month after creeping over the border to Brazil. 
Several hundred activists remain held, most notably Leopoldo Lopez, the hardline leader of Popular Will party who is under house arrest in Caracas. ""My commitment now is to fight for the other political prisoners,"" said Crovato.

Syrian government forces have splintered eastern Ghouta into three separate zones in a month-long assault to crush the last major opposition stronghold near Damascus, confronting the rebels with their biggest defeat since 2016.
Damascus and its Russian allies are offering rebels in eastern Ghouta similar terms to those offered in other parts of the country that have been recaptured: safe passage out for those who agree to surrender territory, or a reconciliation agreement for those who wish to stay under government rule.
Ali Haidar, the Syrian minister responsible for such agreements, told Reuters in an interview that rebels in an enclave centered around the town of Harasta - one of three rebel pockets in eastern Ghouta - may be ready for such a deal.
Haidar said there were contacts with Ghouta rebels and ""to a certain extent there are acceptable results in part of the file"".
""There may be an accomplishment in Harasta in the coming period. I don't commit to specific timeframes because the matter is linked to the militants accepting departure or settling their situation (with the authorities) and the army entering the area,"" Haidar said.

He said ""what remains of Ghouta is, I believe, open to discussion ... to accomplish reconciliations at a certain level"".

CAIRO (Reuters) - Days ahead of Egypt's presidential election, Moussa Mostafa Moussa, the only candidate standing against incumbent Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, is avoiding the limelight.
Moussa's presidential bid seemed to come as a surprise even to his own party. Hours before the candidate nomination window closed in January, a member of his team was photographed running down a Cairo street to the election commission to make the deadline.
Until then, the obscure leader of the Ghad party had been organizing events to endorse a second term for Sisi.
Moussa denies suggestions by critics that he is running just to provide a candidate other than Sisi in the election, but is still vocally supportive of the former general and army commander and has said he hopes he wins.
The former businessman's apparent change of heart came after all other opposition candidates dropped out, citing intimidation of supporters, media vilification and an unfair campaigning environment after the arrest of the only serious challenger.
Egypt's election commission says the vote will be free and fair, and Sisi's campaign says no candidate wanting to run has been blocked, but the events around other challengers have all but guaranteed Sisi a landslide victory.
Moussa said in several interviews that leaving Sisi as the sole contender was ""an image that was not suitable for Egypt.""
""We have a positive role to play in the competition, so (our bid) comes not just due to our nationalistic motivations - we also think we have ideas to offer,"" Moussa said in a January appearance on a TV show.
Supporters say Sisi has brought more security since 2013, when as army chief he overthrew Islamist President Mohamed Mursi, though Egypt faces a stubborn Islamic State insurgency in the North Sinai region. Critics say Sisi's popularity has been damaged by austerity reforms and a crackdown on political opponents, activists and independent media.
AVOIDING CRITICISM OF SISI
Moussa says he disagrees with Sisi on some policies, chiefly the implementation of a tough economic reform program since late 2016 which has included a currency float and subsidy cuts.
He promises to help farmers, reduce the soaring prices of basic goods, and increase wages to assist the many Egyptians who say they can barely afford enough food.
But most Egyptians know little about Moussa.
For weeks, he was not seen in public apart from some television appearances while thousands of posters supporting Sisi bedecked the streets of Cairo.
When asked about donations to his campaign, he told evening talk show host Lamis al-Hadidi that support has been scant.
""Some people imagine that if they came out and showed support for me they'd be perceived as being against the state, and that's wrong,"" Moussa said.
His first public rally through the streets of central Cairo was attended mostly by journalists eager for a glimpse of the last-minute competitor, rather than supporters. 
Moussa has avoided criticizing Sisi's policies, promising instead to continue along the same path should he win.
Opposition activists, journalists and analysts have dismissed Moussa as a dummy candidate, standing only to give the impression of a full democratic contest.
""I am not an extra!"" Moussa said heatedly at a press conference last month - a line he has often repeated since.
Hadidi asked him during the TV interview if anyone in his family thought the personal funds going into a campaign destined to fail were wasteful. ""They understand my national duty and that I have something to offer,"" Moussa replied.
Despite the ridicule, Moussa has continued to give interviews to local television channels and newspapers, but has declined to be interviewed by the foreign media. 

""I do not want to meet with the foreign press at a time so full of uncertainty...I do not know how they will utilize this meeting, and I know they will not use it against me but against the president and the country. Their goals are full of evil,"" he told state newspaper al-Ahram.

ROME (Reuters) - An Italian court has seized a charity ship on charges that its crew helped illegal immigration by rescuing more than 200 migrants from boats before Libya's coastguard could move in to take them back to Africa, the aid group said.
The case highlighted an increasingly highly charged stand-off between humanitarian groups seeking to save lives on the open seas and European authorities trying to stem the number of people making the dangerous crossing in the first place.
The Spanish charity Proactiva Open Arms picked up the migrants who were in unsafe rubber boats in international waters 73 miles (117 km) off Libya's coast on Thursday, Italy's coast guard said.
The charity ignored orders to stay away by Libya's coastguard, which claimed responsibility for taking in migrants in that stretch of sea, the Italian coastguard added. 
Proactiva released footage that it said showed a young boy sitting in his father's lap on its ship. ""He would have never forgiven us had we returned him to hell,"" Oscar Camps, the founder of Proactiva, said on Twitter. The United Nations has said migrants face dire conditions in Libya.
The charity said it took the migrants to the Sicilian port of Pozzallo on Saturday.
A day later, a court on the island ordered the ship's seizure on suspicion that three Proactiva members, including the captain of the ship and Camps, were operating it as part of a criminal association that favored illegal immigration, Proactiva lawyer Rosa Emanuela Lo Faro said.
""The courts says that Proactiva violated an international agreement,"" Lo Faro told Reuters by telephone, denying any wrongdoing. 
""This is an agreement made with the Libyan government that Open Arms knows nothing about. Open Arms was never notified that the area was a rescue zone managed by the Libyans,"" she said.
SECOND SEIZURE
It is the second time Italy has seized a rescue vessel. A German ship, the Iuventa, was impounded in August on accusations it had aided illegal immigration. The group, Jugend Rettet, denies the charges and is seeking to get the ship back.
Italy has agreed to hand over full responsibility for sea rescues across about a tenth of the Mediterranean to Libya's coast guard by 2020, an accord first reported by Reuters in December.
The country has been on the frontline of boat migrant arrivals for the past four years, when more than 600,000 migrants have reached the country's shores. 
Like in Germany, which took in hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015, the issue was one of the most divisive of the Italy's election campaign. The March 4 vote awarded both the anti-immigrant League party and the 5-Star Movement for their hard line on migrants. 
""Finally an Italian prosecutor who blocks human trafficking,"" League leader Matteo Salvini said on Twitter.
Vincent Cochetel, the U.N. refugee agency's special envoy for the central Mediterranean, said on Twitter he hoped the case did not mark a return of what he called ""the campaign we saw in 2017 against NGOs involved in rescue-at-sea"".

Saleh Muslim formerly headed the PYD, the major part of a coalition governing Kurdish-held areas of northern Syria and which is deemed by Turkey to be a terrorist organization. 
His release from detention, under a February 27 court order, caused a diplomatic row with Ankara which has accused him of aggravated murder and disrupting the Turkish state. 
On his release, he pledged to remain on European Union territory and to cooperate in further proceedings.
The new decision means that the Czech authorities conclude the case completely. 
""The state attorney has halted the proceedings because the person is not on the Czech Republic's territory and thus the extradition process cannot continue,"" spokeswoman Stepanka Zenklova said.
Muslim's lawyer Miroslav Krutina said the decision also meant his client was no longer bound by a pledge to remain in the EU.
""He is free,"" Krutina said.
Ankara, describing his release as a political decision against international law, swore to follow Muslim ""wherever he goes"".
Turkey later asked Germany and Sweden, where Muslim traveled after leaving the Czech Republic, to detain him, but in vain.

The body of Nikolai Glushkov was found at his home in New Malden, southwest London, with a postmortem concluding he had died of ""compression to the neck"".
Glushkov, who had once worked for Russian airline Aeroflot was an associate of late tycoon Boris Berezovsky, a longtime critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Police said there was nothing to link his death to the poisoning of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the English southern city of Salisbury on March 4, an attack Britain has blamed on Russia.
""We have found no sign of forced entry thus far, but the forensic examination at Mr Glushkov's home continues and we expect to be there for some time,"" said Commander Clarke Jarrett from London's Counter Terrorism Command.
""I must stress that there is nothing we have found in our investigation so far to suggest any link to the attempted murders in Salisbury and I would like to reassure the public in New Malden that there are no wider public health concerns in relation to this investigation.""
Jarrett said there was also no evidence Glushkov had been poisoned.
Berezovsky, 67, one of Russia's most powerful figures in the years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, fled to London after a row with Putin in 2000. He was found dead in March 2013 with a scarf tied around his neck in the bathroom of a luxury mansion west of London. 
Police and forensic experts concluded that Berezovsky had committed suicide but a British coroner concluded he could not be sure if the Russian killed himself or was the victim of foul play.
His death is one of 14 being re-examined by British police and security services in the wake of Skripal's attempted murder.

Glushkov was also friends with Marina Litvinenko whose husband Alexander was poisoned with a rare radioactive isotope in 2006, a killing a British public inquiry said was carried out by two Russians in an operation probably ordered by Putin. Moscow has rejected any suggestion of involvement in the murder.

The Philippines, which has the largest Catholic population in Asia, and the Vatican are the only two states in the world without a divorce law, Philippine politicians say.
Congresswoman Emmi de Jesus said the bill was in response to a clamor from women who wanted to get out of failed relationships, particularly from abusive husbands.
""It is not at the president's bidding that we file legislation,"" de Jesus told reporters, referring to opposition to the bill, passed with 134 votes in favor, 57 against and two abstentions, from President Rodrigo Duterte.
De Jesus said the legislative process should ""take its course"". To become law, the upper house Senate must also pass what is known as a counterpart bill but it has yet to begin drafting one.
Duterte, who is legally separated from his wife, opposes making divorce legal. His spokesman Harry Roque, who told reporters Duterte was concerned about the welfare of children whose parents divorce.

""The road is open... everything is running now in the city and in Syria,"" he said in the video, describing a road that had previously been cut by sniper fire and saying it was now easier to travel around the country.
The video, released overnight after a trip on Sunday, showed Assad in sunglasses at the wheel of his Honda car, speaking about the government's increasing strength as peaceful scenery behind him gave way to battle-scarred concrete. 
His visit to the battle front in eastern Ghouta, where state television showed him cheered by soldiers as smoke rose in the distance, came after tens of thousands of civilians began fleeing the opposition area for government lines. 
The army offensive began a month ago with a massive bombardment and has so far retaken most of the area, the biggest rebel enclave near Damascus, cutting it into three zones.
It is the latest in a series of military gains for Assad after Russia entered the war on his side in 2015, ending rebel hopes of toppling him by force. Large areas remain outside his grip, but he now controls the main cities of Syria's heavily-populated west.
IN CONTROL
""This is the picture he wants to give... he is in control and finishing off the opposition in eastern Ghouta,"" said Nikolaos Van Dam, a former diplomat in Syria and author of two books on the country. 
While Assad has increasingly been shown traveling around Syria in recent years, it is unusual for him to visit areas close to the battlefront, as he did on Sunday, meeting cheering soldiers as well as civilians who had escaped the fighting. 
There have been numerous other signs of his increasing confidence, including the release last year of a banknote bearing his image for the first time since he became president in 2000. 
Wearing a suit without a tie and speaking informally to the in-car camera, Assad gave a running commentary on the areas he was driving through and discussed the military campaign. 
He drove into eastern Ghouta from the east - the direction from which the army campaign began a month ago - into the district of Jisreen, which was captured late on Friday. 
""When we see that people are returning to the state, it affirms what we are saying: that people want the state, and the state is the mother and father of everybody,"" he said as he passed civilians who had left the rebel enclave. 
His government and its ally Russia describe the opposition as terrorists and the population in rebel-held areas as human shields for armed groups. 
The opposition says residents of eastern Ghouta - an early center of the uprising against Assad - do not want to return to his rule for fear of persecution, which he denies would happen. 
Speaking to the camera as his car passed from fields into a town pocked with shell holes, Assad said Syria's long-term challenge would be to ""rehabilitate"" children brought up under rebel rule. 
""This generation has lived five years with dark thoughts, and with elements that resemble the days of the Middle Ages,"" he said, saying they needed to be brought back ""onto the right path"".

He said their lost education was the price of the war. ""It can't be avoided one way or another,"" he said.

Cardinal Keith O'Brien, an outspoken critic of gay marriage, resigned after three priests and one former priest complained about incidents of sexual misconduct dating back to the 1980s.
O'Brien initially denied the allegations but then apologized for sexual conduct he said had ""fallen below the standards expected of me"". He quit as archbishop of St. Andrews and Edinburgh in 2013 shortly after Pope Benedict shocked the Catholic world with his own resignation.
O'Brien, once Britain's most senior Catholic cleric, promised to play no further role in the Church in Scotland and did not take part in the conclave that elected Benedict's successor, Pope Francis.
With the agreement of the Holy See, O'Brien subsequently moved to the north of England, where a statement said he had died surrounded by family.
The Catholic Church has been embroiled for years in sexual scandals, most notoriously involving the abuse of children in the United States and Ireland, which were covered up by senior clerics.
""In life, Cardinal O'Brien may have divided opinion,"" said Archbishop Leo Cushley of St. Andrews and Edinburgh. 

""In death, however, I think all can be united in praying for the repose of his soul, for comfort for his grieving family and that support and solace be given to those whom he offended, hurt and let down.""

SALISBURY, England (Reuters) - Inspectors from the world's chemical weapons watchdog on Monday began examining the poison used to strike down a former Russian double agent in England, in an attack that London blames on Moscow.
Britain says Sergei Skripal and his daughter, who are critically ill in hospital, were targeted with the Soviet-era military-grade nerve agent Novichok. It accuses Moscow of stockpiling the toxin and investigating how to use it in assassinations.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, who easily won another six-year term on Sunday, said the claims were nonsense and that Russia had destroyed all its chemical weapons. While the Kremlin told Britain to back up its assertions or apologize, Britain's fellow EU members offered it ""unqualified solidarity"". 
Skripal, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who betrayed dozens of Russian agents to Britain, was found collapsed along with his daughter on a bench in the small southern city of Salisbury two weeks ago.
The identification of Novichok as the weapon has become the central pillar of Britain's case for Russia's culpability. Each has expelled 23 of the other's diplomats as their relations have sunk to a post-Cold War low. 
On Monday, inspectors from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) began running independent tests on samples taken from Salisbury to verify the British analysis, said an OPCW source speaking on condition of anonymity.
""The team from The Hague will meet with officials from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory and the police to discuss the process for collecting samples, including environmental ones,"" Britain's Foreign Office said.
""ABSURD DENIALS""
British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Monday, before meeting his European Union counterparts in Brussels, that Russian denials of responsibility were ""increasingly absurd"".
""This is a classic Russian strategy of trying to conceal the needle of truth in a haystack of lies and obfuscation. They're not fooling anybody any more,"" Johnson told reporters.
""There is scarcely a country around the table here in Brussels that has not been affected in recent years by some kind of malign or disruptive Russian behavior.""
EU diplomats cautioned there was no immediate prospect of fresh economic sanctions on Russia, but the assembled EU foreign ministers did offer strong verbal support.
""The European Union takes extremely seriously the UK government's assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible,"" said their statement.

They said using a nerve agent for the first time on European soil for 70 years would be a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which the OPCW safeguards, and that it represented a ""security threat to us all"".

907,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 07:31AM ET</span>",Saudi women should have choice whether to wear abaya robe: crown prince,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Women in Saudi Arabia need not wear headcover or the black abaya - the loose-fitting, full-length robes symbolic of Islamic piety - as long as their attire is ""decent and respectful"", the kingdom's reform-minded crown prince said.
With the ascent to power of young Prince Mohammad bin Salman, the kingdom has seen an expansion in women's rights including a decision to allow women to attend mixed public sporting events and the right to drive cars from this summer.
The changes have been hailed as proof of a new progressive trend toward modernization in the deeply conservative Muslim kingdom, although the gender-segregated nation continues to be criticized for its continued constraints on women.
""The laws are very clear and stipulated in the laws of sharia (Islamic law): that women wear decent, respectful clothing, like men,"" Prince Mohammed said in an interview with CBS television aired late on Sunday.
""This, however, does not particularly specify a black abaya or a black head cover. The decision is entirely left for women to decide what type of decent and respectful attire she chooses to wear.""
A senior cleric said last month that women should dress modestly, but this did not necessitate wearing the abaya.
It remains unclear if these statements signal a change in the enforcement of women's dress code in the kingdom. Saudi Arabia has no written legal code to go with the texts making up sharia, and police and judiciary have long enforced a strict dress code requiring Saudi women to wear abayas and in many cases to cover their hair and faces.
But the kingdom has witnessed a cautious new climate of social freedoms with the rise of the 32-year-old crown prince to power after decades of elderly rulers. 
Saudi women have started wearing more colorful abayas in recent years, the light blues and pinks in stark contrast with the traditional black. Open abayas over long skirts or jeans are also becoming more common in some parts of the country.
On March 8, a group of women in the Saudi city of Jeddah marked International Women's Day by exercising one of their newly acquired freedoms: the right to go for a jog, paying no heed to bemused onlookers.
However, activists have blasted the country’s continued guardianship system requiring a male family member to grant permission for a woman to study abroad, travel and other activities.

Last week, a U.N. rights watchdog called on Saudi Arabia to end discriminatory practices against women including male guardianship, and give them full access to justice.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish forces will press their offensive against Kurdish YPG fighters along the length of Turkey's border with Syria and if necessary into northern Iraq, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday, threatening wider conflict in Syria's civil war.
A day after Turkish troops swept into Afrin, the main town in a pocket of Kurdish-controlled territory in northwest Syria, Erdogan said Turkey would also target a region stretching nearly 400 km (250 miles) east to the northern Syrian town of Qamishli.
Expanding Turkey's military campaign into the much larger Kurdish-held territory further east would risk confronting troops of a NATO ally, the United States, that are deployed alongside a YPG-dominated force in northern Syria.
The YPG has been Washington's main ally against Islamic State in Syria, in a partnership that has infuriated Turkey which sees the Kurdish force as an extension of a militant group waging a decades-long insurgency in its own southeast.
It launched an air and ground offensive two months ago against the YPG in Afrin, a campaign it dubbed ""Olive Branch"". 
""By controlling Afrin city center yesterday, we have passed the most important step of the Olive Branch operation,"" Erdogan told a gathering of judges and prosecutors in Ankara.
""After this, we will continue now to Manbij, Ayn al-Arab, Tel Abyad, Ras al-Ain and Qamishli until this corridor is fully removed,"" he said, referring to a string of towns along Syria's border region with Turkey.
Turkish authorities have described the stretch of northern Syria under Kurdish control as a ""terror corridor"" on the long southern border. YPG officials have said their focus is on guaranteeing legal and constitutional rights for Syrian Kurds.
INTO IRAQ?
The United States called for those in the area to remain focused on defeating Islamic State, de-escalating conflict and protecting civilian lives, a Pentagon spokesman, Colonel Robert Manning, said.
""We are very concerned about the effect that fighting there has had"" on efforts to defeat Islamic State, he said, adding that Washington wanted to see an end to hostilities before the group had a chance to regroup in eastern Syria. 
The U.S. State Department also called for international aid organizations to be given access to deliver humanitarian assistance in the area. 
Turkey is also concerned about the presence in northern Iraq of militants of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) which has waged the insurgency in Turkey since the 1980s.
The PKK has been based in Qandil mountain region near Iraq's border with Iran, but Erdogan said a ""second Qandil"" was being established in Sinjar, further west. 
He said Turkey had told the Iraqi government to deal with the threat. ""If you are unable to handle it, we can suddenly come into Sinjar one night and clean the PKK from there. If we are friends, if we are brothers, then you will provide us with the necessary facilitations.""
Turkey's prime minister Binali Yildirim was holding talks with the Iraqi government, Erdogan added. ""However, if this issue is prolonged much longer there will be an Olive Branch there too.""
Earlier on Monday government spokesman Bekir Bozdag said Turkish forces would return Afrin to its ""real owners"" after driving the YPG out. 
""We are not permanent there (in Afrin) and we are certainly not invaders. Our goal is to hand the region back to its real owners after clearing it of terrorists,"" Bozdag, who is also a deputy prime minister, told reporters.
A Syrian Kurdish official told Reuters that more than 200,000 people who had fled the Afrin offensive were without shelter, food or water in nearby areas.
""The people with cars are sleeping in the cars, the people without are sleeping under the trees with their children,"" said Hevi Mustafa, a senior member of the Afrin civil authority.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) called for greater access to the civilian population of Afrin. It said the Turkish Red Crescent aid group lacked credibility among Syrian Kurds after Turkey's military operation.
Turkey's emergency aid agency AFAD sent a convoy into Afrin town center on Monday and distributed Turkish Red Crescent materials including food, water and hygiene products.
The Afrin campaign was Turkey's second cross-border operation into Syria during its seven-year-old civil war. The first, dubbed ""Euphrates Shield"", targeted Islamic State and Kurdish fighters further east than Afrin.
After the completion of Euphrates Shield in early 2017, Turkey set up local systems of governance in the swathe of land captured, protected by Turkish forces.

Bozdag said Turkey now aimed to form similar systems in Afrin region, without elaborating.

The former commander, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, was not hurt in the blast that came 10 minutes after his rally ended, in the eastern city of Jalalabad, as people were leaving the site, said Attahullah Khogyani, spokesman for the provincial governor.
Hekmatyar, a major figure in Afghanistan's decades of conflict who served as prime minister for a period during civil war in the 1990s, was in recent years allied with the Taliban.
He returned to Kabul last year under a peace deal with the government, as head of his powerful Hizb-i-Islami party.
No group has claimed responsibility for the blast.

Nangarhar province, of which Jalalabad is capital, shares a long and porous border with Pakistan, and has recent years become a hotbed of militants affiliated to both Islamic State and the Taliban.

The Hague (Reuters) - Bolivian President Evo Morales arrived in The Hague on Monday for the opening of hearings at the World Court, where his land-locked Latin American country is seeking to force Chile to grant it access to the Pacific Ocean.
Bolivia has asked the court, formally known as the International Court of Justice, to order Chile to enter negotiations on the issue, over which it filed the suit in 2013. 
Bolivia, which lost former coastal territory during a war in the 19th century, argues that Chile has not kept later diplomatic promises and obligations under international law to negotiate over ""sovereign access"" -- presumably a land corridor and port under its control.
But in opening arguments, Bolivian lawyers said the country was not asking ""the court to rule on how sovereign access should be arranged... but simply (to ensure) that Chile return to the negotiating table in good faith""
""For 150 years Bolivia has suffered the historical injustice of being landlocked,"" said lawyer Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, adding that Chile had made many promises ""to reconnect Bolivia to the sea"".
Chile was due to respond on Tuesday to those arguments.
Bolivia currently has access to the Pacific via Chilean ports, but must pay fees. Chile argues that the matter was settled by the 1904 peace treaty struck after the War of the Pacific, which fixed current boundaries.
In 2015, the court found it had jurisdiction in the case, despite Chilean opposition.
The issue has been a recurring bone of contention between the Andean neighbors over decades.
Bolivia, which still retains a navy, wants a corridor to the sea to boost its exports of natural gas and minerals. Chile argues Bolivia already has access on favorable terms. 
Oral arguments run through March 28. Then judges will deliberate for several months before setting the date for a ruling.

The International Court of Justice is the United Nations' highest court for disputes between nations. Its rulings are binding and cannot be appealed, though countries have occasionally flouted them.

""The European Union strongly condemns the attack that took place against Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, UK on 4 March 2018, that also left a police officer seriously ill.

""The European Union is shocked at the offensive use of any military-grade nerve agent, of a type developed by Russia, for the first time on European soil in over 70 years. The use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances is completely unacceptable and constitutes a security threat to us all.

914,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 05:44AM ET</span>",Collateral damage: How Trump threw Canada's refugee system into turmoil,"By Anna Mehler Paperny
TORONTO (Reuters) - Buffered by three oceans and the United States to the south, Canada has for decades had the luxury of being able to pick and choose its newcomers. So few asylum seekers crossed the U.S. border illegally over the years that Canada didn’t consistently track the numbers.
That has changed dramatically over the past 14 months. U.S. President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration and his move to strip Haitians, Salvadorans and others of their temporary legal status have had a broad effect on Canada’s refugee system, Reuters interviews with social service providers, government officials and a review of Canadian immigration data show.
More than 20,000 people, including thousands of Haitians and Nigerians and hundreds of Turks, Syrians and Eritreans, have crossed the border into Canada illegally over the past year in search of asylum, many fleeing in fear that Trump would deport them to their home countries. 
This unexpected northward migration has overwhelmed Canada's system for processing asylum claims, leading to the worst delays in years. Aid agencies are also struggling to house asylum-seekers because of a shortage of accommodation in the four cities most affected by the migration wave - Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg and Vancouver.
(For graphics on the impact see http://tmsnrt.rs/2HCp4aD)
While some of this has been reported, this story offers the most complete picture to date of the unintended effect of Trump's immigration policies on the United States' northern neighbor.
The Canadian government was forced to set aside C$173 million in its latest budget to pay for extra patrols at border crossings to cope with the influx, as well as security screening and processing of refugee applications.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has discussed the situation with the Trump administration, but it has been careful not to publicly blame the U.S. president's policies for triggering the migration wave. Nevertheless, it is already making preparations for more people to cross the border once the weather warms.
“We will be ready,” Immigration and Refugee Minister Ahmed Hussen said in an interview.
Aid agencies who are at the forefront of dealing with the influx say they are struggling and need more funding, a comprehensive long-term plan and better coordination with Ottawa.
“It’s going to get worse. The numbers keep climbing,” said Ilona Beiks, vice president of the Inland Refugee Society of British Columbia, which had to turn away refugees last year for the first time in its 35-year history because it did not have enough money to cope with the growing number of asylum seekers.
The influx shows no signs of abating. More than 1,500 asylum seekers walked across the border in January. Those working with refugee claimants say this is no blip: It’s the new normal.
Since January 2017 Reuters has sought to obtain the numbers of asylum seekers who walked across the U.S. border into Canada in the years prior to Trump's election. The Canadian government has said no national historical data is available.
 
WORSENING DELAYS
Trump's tougher immigration policies have had a major impact on Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Board, which determines refugee claims. It has become so overwhelmed with cases it is ignoring legislated time limits for dealing with them.
All refugee claims are supposed to be processed within 60 days. Increasingly, the board has failed to meet those targets. In December 2017, 86 percent of hearings did not happen within prescribed time frames, according to previously unpublished data reviewed by Reuters. That was up from 66 percent in December 2016, a month after Trump was elected president, and 26 percent in December 2015.
On Feb. 20 the board said it will effectively prioritize those applicants who have been waiting months or years. This will mean a longer wait for more recent arrivals than the current 20-month average estimated time for processing claims.
The government is “committed to an efficient and fair asylum system,"" said a spokesman for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, the government department responsible for the Immigration and Refugee Board.
Canada’s refugee tribunals have historically been leery of claims made by people who come through its wealthy southern neighbor. But of the more than 2,500 claims finalized last year, 53 percent were granted refugee status.
Rulings reviewed by Reuters indicate the tribunals are giving credence to claimants who say they feared deportation or racist attacks following Trump's election on a platform advocating more restrictions on immigration.
 
ACCOMMODATION SQUEEZE
Asylum seekers are walking across the border into some of the tightest housing markets on the continent.
Last summer, thousands slept in Montreal’s Olympic stadium.
In Toronto, 31 percent of the people sleeping in city-run shelters in January were refugee claimants – up from nearly 19 percent a year ago, according to city data.
In November, Toronto approved the booking of more hotel rooms for refugee claimants through the end of 2018, at a cost of about C$20 million, according to city documents.
The city is working on a more comprehensive refugee plan but it needs more help from the federal government, said councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam. The status quo, renting thousands of hotel beds, “is absolutely unsustainable,” she said.
“We are not saying ‘No’ to refugees. We are saying, ‘Absolutely: Come and live in Toronto. Build your life in Toronto.’ But we cannot do this without the support of other orders of government,” she said.
Toronto’s mayor “has raised this issue repeatedly with the federal government,” the mayor's spokesman, Don Peat, wrote in an email.
The federal government says it won’t give cities more money for asylum seekers, who are barred from accessing a C$762 million federal fund that is for permanent residents or people who have already been granted refugee status.
A spokesman for Hussen, the immigration minister, said asylum seekers can access provincial programs. Some agencies Reuters spoke with, however, said that isn’t enough and that a national effort is needed.
Toronto is not alone in asking for help. Vancouver has asked the British Columbia provincial government for more money for refugee aid agencies, said city spokesman Jag Sandhu, and the province has promised C$6 million a year over three years. Winnipeg is coordinating with the Manitoba government to find accommodation for refugee claimants, the city said.
'WE'RE STRUGGLING'
Canada has no formal system for integrating refugee claimants and depends heavily on aid agencies that operate independently but are funded through a combination of government grants and private donations.
Dozens of agencies in Toronto, Winnipeg, Vancouver and Montreal are taking the lead in housing and feeding new arrivals and helping them find schools and employment.
Of 17 organizations Reuters spoke with, 11 said interviews with border crossers confirmed that many were fleeing because of Trump's immigration policies.
“We know the numbers have increased because of what’s going on in the U.S.,” said Toronto-based doctor Meb Rashid, who runs the provincially funded Crossroads Clinic.
The number of patients at the clinic grew 40 percent in a year and people now wait several weeks for an appointment, Rashid said.
“We’re struggling, I have to be honest with you.""
Two aid groups said they have had to turn people away, one has had to intensify its fundraising, two have had to extend their operating hours to meet demand, while six who help to house new arrivals are struggling to find accommodation for them.
The Manitoba Interfaith Immigration Council in Winnipeg has seen its refugee claimant caseload increase fivefold in the past year, said executive director Rita Chahal.
“The impact has been huge,” she said, adding that the organization had to launch its first fundraising drive in years to meet the additional costs.
The Canadian government has dispatched lawmakers to diaspora communities in the United States to persuade people not to come. But it has said little about what conversations it has had with Washington on stemming the migration.
The spokesman for Hussen, the immigration minister, said Canada has a “long-standing, solid working relationship” with the United States.
Meanwhile, the contingency plans being developed to deal with the expected surge in border crossers include redeploying police and border agents to overwhelmed areas and setting up accommodation such as tents and trailers at ports of entry, said a spokesman for the Canada Border Services Agency.
“There is an expectation the numbers will go up ... as the weather gets better,” said a source familiar with the Canadian government's thinking. “And who knows what the next order coming from down south will be?""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain's foreign minister won further support from the European Union and NATO on Monday over a nerve agent attack on a former Russian double agent as he denounced Moscow's denials of involvement as ""increasingly absurd"".
Johnson discussed the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia at a session of EU foreign ministers, which he addressed, and in a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg after statements of solidarity last week by a host of Western governments.
""Our NATO allies have shown such undivided support,"" Johnson told reporters after meeting Stoltenberg.
All 28 EU foreign ministers issued a joint statement on the attack, expressing ""unqualified solidarity"".
""The European Union takes extremely seriously the UK government's assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible,"" the statement said.
Russia, including its president, Vladimir Putin, denies any involvement.
The Russian Foreign Ministry later said it regretted the EU comments, which it said were motivated by ""anti-Russian reflexes.""
""This state of affairs, of course, does not bring honour on the common foreign policy of the EU,"" it said in a statement.
Johnson said he saw a ""classic Russian strategy"" as he arrived for the EU meeting, a day after Putin was re-elected for another six-year term as president.
""They're not fooling anybody anymore,"" Johnson said.
""There is scarcely a country around the table here in Brussels that has not been affected in recent years by some kind of malign or disruptive Russian behaviour.""
Stoltenberg echoed that position, saying: ""Russia will continue to seek to divide us.""
Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom meanwhile accused the Russian Foreign Ministry of deliberately sowing confusion by suggesting the nerve agent used in the attack on the Skripals might have come from Sweden. 
""This is just ridiculous and totally unfounded,"" Wallstrom said. ""I think they are trying to divert the real issues here.""
Moscow on Saturday announced the expulsion of 23 British diplomats in a tit-for-tat response to Britain's decision last week to expel the same number of Russian diplomats from London. 
On Sunday, Johnson accused Russia of stockpiling the deadly Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok used to poison the Skripals, a charge Moscow denies.
The couple were found unconscious on a bench in the English city of Salisbury on March 4 and remain in a critical condition in hospital.
British police meanwhile said the investigation into the attack was likely to take many months since it was a highly complex operation.
""This is one of the largest and most complex investigations undertaken by British counter terrorism policing,"" the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.
Asked what support Britain had requested from the EU and NATO to counter Russia, Johnson said he was seeking to intensify work on a range of strategies, such as defences against Russian attacks on computer networks, challenging disinformation campaigns and acting against criminal financial networks.
""There are things we can and must do together,"" Johnson said, adding that Britain was ""going after the money that has been illicitly or corruptly obtained,"" without giving details. 
While there was no immediate prospect of further sanctions on Russia, British Prime Minister Theresa May will have an opportunity to present her case for any such measures at an EU summit on Thursday, or call for others to expel diplomats.

""We need to put pressure on Russia to take part in a real enquiry about the attack,"" Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders told reporters.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - France urged the European Union on Monday to consider new sanctions on Iran over its involvement in Syria's civil war and its ballistic missile program, as Paris tries to persuade Washington to preserve a 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran.
U.S. President Donald Trump has given the European signatories a May 12 deadline to ""fix the terrible flaws"" of the deal, which was agreed under his predecessor Barack Obama, or he will refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief on Iran.
In response, the three European signatories - France, Britain and Germany - have proposed new EU sanctions targeting Iranians who support Syria's government in that country's civil war and Tehran's ballistic missile program, according to a confidential document seen by Reuters. 
""We are determined to ensure that the Vienna accord is respected,"" French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters on arrival for talks with his EU counterparts, referring to the city where the 2015 deal was signed.
""But we must not exclude (from consideration) Iran's responsibility in the proliferation of ballistic missiles and in its very questionable role in the near- and Middle East,"" he said. ""That must also be discussed to reach a common position."" 
The confidential document cites ""transfers of Iranian missiles and missile technology"" to Syria and allies of Tehran, such as Houthi rebels in Yemen and Lebanon's Shi'ite Hezbollah.
SANCTIONS
Any EU-wide measures would be the first significant punitive steps since the bloc lifted broad economic sanctions on Iran last year following the 2015 accord to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions for at least a decade. 
But new sanctions would need the support of all 28 EU member states. Some of them are keen to rebuild a business relationship that once made the EU Iran's top trading partner and its second-biggest oil customer.
""We have to explore all the possible measures to have the same type of pressure as we had in the nuclear dossier,"" Belgium's Foreign Minister Didier Reynders told reporters.
""We have to examine all the possibilities that we have to put pressure on Iran in these areas,"" he said.
EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, who chaired the final stages of the nuclear negotiations between Iran and Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States, stressed that there was no formal EU position on new sanctions.

""We'll discuss ways in which we can keep the full implementation of the nuclear deal with Iran,"" Mogherini said of the EU strategy so far. ""There's no (EU) proposal of additional sanctions against Iran.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU Brexit negotiators summoned national envoys and journalists at short notice on Monday as speculation mounted among diplomats of an interim deal to grant Britain a transition -- though some urged caution.
""There could be a deal,"" one senior EU diplomat said. Another, however, played down talk that good progress in negotiations with Britain over the weekend had covered enough ground to assure London of a transition deal after Brexit. 
A major sticking point is Britain's reluctance to agree to terms on the Irish border set out in a separate part of the draft withdrawal treaty currently under discussion. 
Britain has been hoping for an interim accord on the transition to ease fears among businesses before Prime Minister Theresa May meets fellow EU leaders at a summit in Brussels on Thursday. The following day, the other leaders are expected to agree terms for talks on future trade relations and May hopes that they will also endorse the interim accord on transition.
Member states' representatives in Brussels were summoned to an urgent meeting by the bloc's Brexit negotiators on Monday, diplomats and officials said. It was convening shortly before British Brexit Secretary David Davis was due to arrive about 11 a.m. (1000 GMT) to meet EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.
The European Commission scheduled a news conference on Brexit for 12:45 p.m. Officials did not immediately confirm that it would be given by Davis and Barnier. They have typically spoken together after rounds of negotiation have concluded.
Their teams negotiated into the night on Saturday and Sunday to clear outstanding issues and -- London hopes -- secure a status-quo adaptation period of about two years after Brexit, which is due in March 2019.
Several EU officials and diplomats said the intense weekend talks aimed, among other things, at resolving serious differences over the Irish border had made good progress. 
But one senior EU source involved in discussions said talk of a deal being agreed already was ""hype"". 
Spokesmen for Barnier and the British government declined official comment.
The transition period is crucial for businesses and sterling has weakened several times in recent weeks as Barnier warned that negotiations were slow and the transition was not a given. 
But talks have intensified since and the EU has said Britain was giving ground to ensure the transition agreement. Differences over how to avoid border checks on the island of Ireland have emerged as the key remaining obstacle.
The EU says a border between the Republic of Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland would be unavoidable since London has said it will also be leaving the bloc's single market and customs union.
But both sides are determined to avoid erecting border checks again, fearing it could reignite violence the island experienced for decades. 
Britain says the Irish settlement should only be decided as part of a future agreement between Britain and the bloc on their new relations following Brexit and the end of the transition period. 

London has proposed using top-notch technology to make the checks seamless but the EU dismisses that as unrealistic.

918,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 10:46AM ET</span>","After landslide re-election, Russia's Putin tells West: I don't want arms race","By Andrew Osborn and Christian Lowe
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin struck a softer tone toward the West on Monday after winning his biggest ever election victory, saying he had no desire for an arms race and would do everything he could to resolve differences with other countries.
Putin's victory, which comes at a time when his relations with the West are on a hostile trajectory, will extend his political dominance of Russia by six years to 2024. That will make him the longest-serving ruler since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin and has raised Western fears of spiraling confrontation.
But Putin, 65, used a Kremlin meeting with the candidates he soundly defeated in Sunday's election to signal his desire to focus on domestic, not international, matters, and to try to raise living standards by investing more in education, infrastructure and health while reducing defense spending.
""Nobody plans to accelerate an arms race,"" said Putin.
""We will do everything to resolve all the differences with our partners using political and diplomatic channels.""
His comments, which are likely to be heard with some scepticism in the West following years of confrontation, mark a change in tone after a bellicose election campaign during which Putin unveiled new nuclear weapons he said could strike almost any point in the world..
Russia is currently at odds with the West over Syria and Ukraine; allegations of cyber attacks and meddling in foreign elections; and the poisoning in Britain of a former Russian spy and his daughter. As a result, relations with the West have hit a post-Cold-War low. 
FREE AND FAIR?
With nearly 100 percent of the votes counted, the Central Election Commission (CEC), announced that Putin, who has run Russia as president or prime minister since 1999, had won 76.69 percent of the vote.
With more than 56 million votes, it was Putin's biggest ever win and the largest by any post-Soviet Russian leader.
But the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), a rights watchdog, said restrictions on fundamental freedoms, as well as on candidate registration, had restricted the scope for political engagement and crimped competition.
""Choice without real competition, as we have seen here, is not real choice,"" the OSCE said in a statement.
The CEC said earlier on Monday it had not registered any serious complaints of violations. 
Backed by state TV and the ruling party, and credited with an approval rating of around 80 percent, Putin faced no credible threat from a field of seven challengers.
His nearest rival, Communist Party candidate Pavel Grudinin, won 11.8 percent while nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky got 5.6 percent. His most vocal opponent, anti-corruption campaigner Alexei Navalny, was barred from running.
Navalny, who had called on voters to boycott the election, urged his supporters not to lose heart and said his campaign had succeeded in lowering the turnout, accusing authorities of being forced to falsify the numbers.
EXIT STRATEGY?
Near-final figures put turnout at 67.7 percent, just shy of the 70 percent the Kremlin was reported to have been aiming for before the vote.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov played down suggestions that tensions with the West had boosted turnout, saying the result showed that Russians were united behind Putin's plans to develop the country. 
He said Putin would spend the day fielding calls of congratulation, meeting supporters, and holding talks with the losing candidates.
Chinese President Xi Jinping was among the first to offer his congratulations to Putin, but Heiko Maas, Germany's new foreign minister, questioned whether there had been fair political competition.
French President Emmanuel Macron was one of the few Western leaders to speak by telephone to Putin on Monday, wishing Russia and its people success in modernizing the country.
How long Putin wants to stay in power remains uncertain.
The constitution limits the president to two successive terms, obliging him to step down at the end of his new mandate. 
Asked after his re-election if he would run for yet another term in the future, Putin laughed off the idea.
""Let's count. What, do you think I will sit (in power) until I'm 100 years old?"" he said, calling the question ""funny"".
Although Putin has six years to consider a possible successor, uncertainty about his future is a potential source of instability in a fractious ruling elite that only he can keep in check. 

""The longer he stays in power, the harder it will be to exit,"" said Andrei Kolesnikov, senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, a think-tank. ""How can he abandon such a complicated system, which is essentially his personal project?""

920,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 04:31AM ET</span>","Court hears some alleged historical offences by Vatican's Pell were at a pool, cinema","MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Some alleged historical sexual offences by Vatican treasurer George Pell took place at a movie theater and at a swimming pool, a court heard on Monday during a hearing to determine whether to send the case against the Australian Cardinal to trial.
Pell, 76, is the most senior Catholic official worldwide to face such charges, the details of which have not been made public.
His lawyers have said at previous administrative hearings he will plead not guilty to all charges. Pell is not required to enter a formal plea unless a magistrate determines there is cause for a full trial.
The Melbourne Magistrates' Court heard at the start of the third week of pre-trial hearings that one alleged offense had taken place about 40 years ago at a movie theater in a regional area in the state of Victoria.
However, a person who was a projectionist at the cinema at that time and knew Pell from attending church told the court that he did not recall ever having seen him at the theater.
Pell's lawyer also mentioned an alleged offense more than four decades ago at a swimming pool.
A witness told the court that he had seen Pell at the pool ""on numerous occasions"", but had never seen anything untoward nor experienced anything improper.
""For me personally, no. I don't recall it ever being inappropriate,"" he said. His name cannot be disclosed as it might help identify Pell's accusers.
At the hearing last week, the court heard of alleged offences at other locations in Victoria state.
Australian police last year summoned Pell to return to his home country to appear on charges of historical sexual offences from multiple complainants. He is on a leave of absence from his Vatican role as Pope Francis' economy minister, which he started in 2014.
The pontiff has said he will not comment on the case until it is over. 

The pre-trial hearing is scheduled to go on until the end of March.

The explosion hit after the Syrian rebels swept into the town with Turkish forces on Sunday, declaring full control after an eight-week campaign to drive out Kurdish YPG forces.
Anadolu said the bomb, which it described as planted by terrorists, exploded as the Syrian fighters conducted a search. It ripped out a hole four meters (4.37 yards) deep and badly damaged other buildings and vehicles, it said.
A spokesman for the Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army rebels said on Sunday they had entered Afrin before dawn, meeting no resistance. A war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said some YPG fighters defied orders to withdraw, but Turkish forces were in control.
Turkey says the YPG is an extension of the militant PKK group fighting an insurgency inside Turkey, and vowed to crush what it described as a ""terror corridor"" of YPG-controlled territory along Turkey's southern border with Syria.
It has said its next target would be a Syrian region further east where U.S. forces are stationed alongside the YPG, Washington's ally against Islamic State in Syria.

The ruling by the Hakodate District Court in Hokkaido prefecture on the Ohma plant will be welcomed by many utilities as they push for a return to nuclear power following the 2011 Fukushima disaster, despite strong opposition from chunks of the public.
More than 1,100 residents in Hokkaido, among others, had filed the lawsuit in 2010 to prevent Ohma from starting. The construction of the 1,383-megawatt plant, which will use mixed oxide fuel, a blend of uranium and plutonium recycled from spent nuclear fuel, started in 2008, but work was suspended after Fukushima in 2011.
Building resumed in 2012, but has been delayed as the company has to meet new safety requirements imposed after the 2011 disaster, a company spokesman said. The station is about 38-percent complete, he said.
J-Power in 2016 pushed back the planned start of operation by two years to 2024/25.
""We are doing all we can for the start of operations in the 2024/25 business year,"" the spokesman added.
The ruling marks the latest judgment on atomic power in the country, with critics of nuclear energy having more success in some other cases.
A high court in western Japan sided with residents last December to prevent the restart of a nuclear plant idled for scheduled maintenance, although lower court decisions have usually been turned down on appeal.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel said on Monday it had arrested a French citizen, an employee of France's consulate in Jerusalem, on suspicion of using a diplomatic car to smuggle guns from the Islamist Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip to Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.
Held since Feb 15, Romain Franck is accused of moving a total of 70 pistols and two assault rifles between the Palestinian territories on at least five occasions, the Shin Bet security agency said after a gag order on the case was lifted.
Franck ""acted for financial profit, on his own initiative and without the knowledge of his superiors,"" a Shin Bet statement said. He is not believed to have also had an ideological motives such as support for Palestinian militants, a Shin Bet official told Reuters.
""This is a very serious incident in which the immunity and privileges granted to foreign diplomatic missions in Israel were cynically exploited to smuggle dozens of weapons that may be used for terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians and security forces,"" the statement said.
Franck, 23, was due to appear at a 1230 GMT Israeli court hearing at which formal charges would be filed. His lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment on how Franck might plead. 
A Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page under the name Roman Franck, and carrying photographs that looked similar to the mugshot published by the Shin Bet, shows images of the young man against desert vistas.
""Feeling good in Palestine,"" says one caption. 
A Jan. 17 posting said the Facebook account-holder was ""traveling to Jerusalem starting to (sic) a new adventure"". 
A spokesman for the French Embassy in Tel Aviv described Franck as ""a member of the consulate-general in Jerusalem"" and said France was taking the case seriously and cooperating with Israeli authorities.
Franck was arrested along with a Palestinian from East Jerusalem employed as a security guard at the consulate as well as seven other suspects, the Shin Bet said. 
It accused him of using a consulate-owned sports utility vehicle, which enjoyed more cursory Israeli security checks due to its diplomatic status, to bring the factory-produced guns from Gaza to Palestinian arms dealers in the West Bank. 
According to the Shin Bet statement, Franck received the guns from a Palestinian employed by the French Cultural Centre in Gaza. It could not immediately be reached for comment.
Most countries keep their embassies to Israel in Tel Aviv, as well as consulates in Jerusalem that handle diplomatic outreach to the Palestinians.
Israel counts all of Jerusalem as its capital, a status not recognized abroad although the United States, breaking with other world powers, plans to move its embassy in Israel to the city in May.
Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a state they seek to establish in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

927,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 02:31AM ET</span>",Norway's Christian Democrats to decide government's fate in terror row,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's Christian Democrats, holding the balance of power in parliament, are expected to decide on Monday whether to back a no-confidence vote against Justice Minister Sylvi Listhaug, a rarely used step that would probably bring down the government.
Listhaug recently rocked Norway's traditionally consensual politics by accusing the opposition Labour Party - target of the country's worst peacetime massacre - of putting terrorists' rights before national security.
Five center-left parties last week said they would vote on Tuesday to oust the minister, leaving her fate in the hands of the small Christian Democratic Party, which has scheduled meetings on Monday to discuss its vote.
On Sunday, daily Verdens Gang and broadcasters NRK and TV2 quoted sources close to Prime Minister Erna Solberg saying her cabinet would stand by Listhaug and resign if the no-confidence vote succeeds.
Snap elections are not allowed, and Norway's next general election is not due until 2021. This may allow Solberg to form a new government, but may also throw the job to Labour leader Jonas Gahr Stoere if the Christian Democrats switch sides.
On July 22, 2011, far-right extremist Anders Behring Breivik killed eight people in downtown Oslo with a car bomb and then shot dead 69 people, many of them teenagers, at a Labour party camp on Utoeya Island.
On Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Listhaug recently posted a photograph of masked people clad in military fatigues, black scarves and ammunition with the text: ""Labour thinks terrorists' rights are more important than the nation's security. Like and Share"".
The comments unleashed a political storm, and Listhaug, a member of the right-wing Progress Party, apologized in parliament on March 13. Most opposition parties, however, said her gesture was not sincere enough.
But although many attempts have been made by parties in parliament to oust governments via no-confidence motions, the last vote to succeed in bringing down a cabinet was in 1963.
Daily Aftenposten on Monday said that Solberg and Christian Democrats leader Knut Arild Hareide had discussed the possibility of defusing the situation by having Listhaug apologize a second time.
The dispute erupted after Labour and the Christian Democrats helped defeat a bill allowing the state the right, without judicial review, to strip individuals of Norwegian citizenship if they are suspected of terrorism or joining foreign militant groups.

While Hareide's party has backed Conservative leader Solberg for prime minister since 2013, it has declined invitations to join the cabinet, primarily due to its opposition to the Progress Party.

Dinh La Thang, 57, was sentenced to 13 years in prison in January in a separate case to become the highest-level politician to have been sentenced for decades.
He was back in a Hanoi court on Monday facing an accusation of ""deliberate violation of state regulations on economic management"", his lawyer, Nguyen Huy Thiep, said.
Thang faces up to 20 years in prison if found guilty, in addition to the 13-year sentence handed down in January, after he was found guilty of ""economic mismanagement"" at a coal-fired power plant overseen by state-owned energy firm PetroVietnam, of which Thang was chairman.
The Poltiburo is Vietnam's top decision-making body. Thang lost his position in the Politburo last year, after he came under suspicion of wrongdoing.
In the new trial, he and six other defendants are accused of wrongdoing in connection with causing losses of up to 800 billion dong ($35.1 million) in PetroVietnam's investment in Ocean Commercial Joint Stock Bank.
Ocean Bank suffered heavy losses and was forcibly taken over in 2015 by the State Bank of Vietnam, the central bank.
The trial is the latest in a string of high-profile cases in coming from a crackdown on graft in Vietnam, where dozens of state officials have been prosecuted over the past year. Critics say the crackdown is also politically motivated. 
The trial is expected to last until March 31, said Thiep, who added that Thang was in good health.

No deaths or serious injuries were reported on Monday but the bushfires have caused extensive damage in rural areas of Victoria and New South Wales (NSW), Australia's two most populous states. More than 100 houses were damaged or destroyed, authorities said.
""At this stage (there have been) no lives lost,"" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said at a news conference in the small NSW coastal town of Tathra.
""It is just a great credit to the firefighters, to the volunteers, the emergency workers - all of the community has pulled together and provided such great support,"" he said. 
The fires, believed to have been sparked by lightning on Saturday, were fanned by dry, hot winds as temperatures reached 41 degrees Celsius (106 Fahrenheit) on Sunday.
Emergency officials said conditions should ease later on Monday but ""watch and act"" warnings remained in place for five locations.
The fire also set off an argument among Australia's politicians on whether climate change was a contributing factor to the blazes.
""You can't attribute any particular event, whether it's a flood or fire or a drought ...to climate change. We are the land of droughts and flooding rains, we're the land of bushfires,"" Turnbull said.
Authorities said some 69 houses were destroyed and a further 39 were damaged and 30 caravans or cabins were also wiped out in Tathra, where residents fled to the beach on Sunday to avoid the flames as flying embers quickly carried the firefront forward.
About 700 residents were evacuated to centers set up at the nearby town of Bega and several schools in affected areas were closed on Monday.
NSW Rural Fire Service Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers earlier told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that five of 22 fires had not yet been contained. 
""There's still a lot of fire around the landscape,"" he said, warning that it would still be several days before they were extinguished.
About 280 firefighters were battling the blazes, while 22,000 homes were without power in the region after high winds brought down trees, Emergency Management Commissioner Craig Lapsley said late on Sunday.
Bushfires are a common and deadly threat in Australia's hot, dry summers, fueled by highly flammable eucalyptus trees.
In January, hundreds of holidaymakers had to be evacuated by boat from the beaches of the Royal National Park south of Sydney when they became trapped by bushfires.

The 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria killed 173 people and injured more than 400.

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A serial bomber is suspected of planting four bombs detonated this month around Austin, Texas, that have killed two people and injured four others and unnerved residents of the Texas capital. 
""We are clearly dealing with what we expect to be a serial bomber at this point,"" Austin Police Chief Brian Manley told a news conference on Monday. ""We have seen similarities in the devices that exploded here last night and the other three devices.""
Two men were injured on Sunday by the latest bomb, which police said may have been activated by a trip wire across a sidewalk, a more advanced design than the previous bombs that were set off when victims handled packages left on doorsteps. 
The men, 22 and 23 years old, were taken to a hospital with what police described as ""substantial"" but not life threatening injuries.
Manley said that more than 500 federal agents were involved in the investigation, including from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. 
On Sunday agents swept the relatively affluent neighborhood called Travis Country where Sunday's bomb exploded and asked residents for home surveillance videos.
""It's scary,"" Thad Holt, a 76-year-old retiree, said in an interview, recalling that he and his wife had strolled near the bomb site about half an hour before the explosion. ""It's one of those things ... that happens elsewhere.""
Austin, with a population of nearly 1 million people, is home to the University of Texas and a plethora of tech companies and has been one of the fastest growing major U.S. cities. 
MOTIVE UNKNOWN
Investigators were trying to identify the person or persons responsible for three parcel bombs that exploded in three east side neighborhoods, killing a man and a teenage boy, both black and leaving a Hispanic woman fighting for her life.
Police said the fourth bomb had similarities to the three parcel bombs. They said whoever was responsible was trying to send a message and should contact authorities to explain.
Chief Manley has said police were also investigating the bombings as possible hate crimes, but cautioned on Monday that the theory may not hold up as Sunday's attack did not appear to have targeted specific people and both victims were white.
The first parcel bomb on March 2 killed Anthony Stephan House, a 39-year-old black man. A bomb last Monday morning killed Draylen Mason, a 17-year-old African-American teenager and budding musician, and injured his mother, whose name was not made public. A few hours later, a third bomb injured a 75-year-old Hispanic woman, who has not been identified.
Police have received more than 700 calls about suspicious packages since the three parcel bombs, but authorities have not found any that posed a security risk, Manley said.

A reward of $115,000 has been offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible.

All the victims were employees at the hotel casino owned and operated by state gaming regulator Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp.
The Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) said it was still verifying a report that another victim that was brought to the hospital had also died. Several people were injured.
Around 300 guests and more than 70 Pagcor employees, who were evacuated from the Manila Pavilion Hotel and Casino as the fire raged through several floors, have all been accounted for, firefighters said.
The hotel is owned and operated by Acesite (Phils.) Hotel Corp, a subsidiary of Waterfront Philippines Inc.
""Hotel operations have been temporarily suspended until the proper clearances from the government regulatory agencies have been obtained,"" Acesite told the Philippine Stock Exchange on Monday.
The company said it was still waiting for the BFP's final report on what really caused the fire.
Firefighters said several floors of the 509-room hotel were ""totally damaged"" but their investigation was still incomplete.
Shares of Acesite, which said the hotel was its main operating asset, fell as much as 10 percent at one time during morning trade, while Waterfront shares declined as much as 8.3 percent.

The project ""will develop a pipeline of high-quality infrastructure projects, to attract private and public investment"", according to a statement from Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop issued on Sunday.
Australia, the United States, India and Japan have been seeking to establish a regional alternative to China's multibillion-dollar Belt and Road infrastructure scheme, according to a report in the Australian Financial Review last month that cited a senior U.S. official.
A spokeswoman for Bishop said on Monday the agreement was purely an ASEAN initiative and ""not to counter China"".
Australia hosted the special ASEAN meeting, despite not being a member of the 10-nation bloc, looking to tighten political and trade ties in a region where Chinese presence is growing stronger. 
A joint communique issued by Australia and ASEAN at the end of the meeting called for ""self-restraint"" in the South China Sea, where aggressive Chinese expansion has irked ASEAN members who also have territorial claims in the busy waterway.
""This is a security and stability question in Southeast Asia which will affect all ASEAN countries if it goes wrong,"" Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told a news conference shortly after the communique was issued.
Chinese President Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road plan is a vehicle for the world's second-largest economy to take a greater role on the international stage by funding and building transport and trade links in more than 60 countries.

Xi has promoted the initiative heavily, inviting world leaders to Beijing last May for an inaugural summit at which he pledged $124 billion in funding for the plan, and enshrining it into the ruling Communist Party's constitution in October.

Suu Kyi has been in Australia since Friday, attending a special summit of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) leaders in Sydney, where her presence drew street protests and a lawsuit accusing her of crimes against humanity.
Australia's Attorney General has said he would not allow the lawsuit, lodged by activist lawyers in Melbourne on behalf of Australia's Rohingya community, to proceed because Suu Kyi had diplomatic immunity. 
Since coming to power in 2016, Suu Kyi, who won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for her struggle for democracy in Myanmar, has faced growing criticism for failing to condemn or stop military attacks on her country's minority Rohingya Muslims.
U.N. officials say nearly 700,000 Muslim Rohingya have fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar to Bangladesh after militant attacks on Aug. 25 last year sparked a crackdown, led by security forces, in Rakhine state that the United Nations and United States have said constitutes ethnic cleansing.
The U.N. independent investigator on human rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, said in Geneva this month she saw growing evidence to suspect genocide had been committed.
Myanmar denies the charges and has asked for ""clear evidence"" of abuses by security forces. 
Neither Suu Kyi nor Turnbull made public remarks before their meeting, but the Australian leader said on Sunday that Suu Kyi spoke ""at considerable length"" during the ASEAN meeting about Rakhine State, appealing to her Southeast Asian neighbors for humanitarian help.
Suu Kyi had been scheduled to give a speech and answer questions at a foreign policy think-tank event in Sydney on Tuesday but canceled because she was not feeling well, event organizers said, without giving more details.

Suu Kyi's spokesman Zaw Htay declined comment and referred questions to the Myanmar embassy in Canberra. A Reuters call to the embassy went unanswered.

Sources had previously told Reuters that Wang would probably become a state councillor with responsibility for foreign affairs, and that he may also keep his job as foreign minister.
He has been likened to a ""silver fox"" in China's state media, and online, for his looks and his staunch defense of Chinese positions, which has won him a loyal following. Foreign diplomats say he can be suave and charming, as well as tough.
Unusually friendly to the foreign media for a senior Chinese official, Wang has won plaudits in China for his tough line on issues like the disputed South China Sea and quick-witted - sometimes bad-tempered quips - to counter criticism of China.
Wang, 64, has been China's foreign minister since 2013. A career diplomat and fluent Japanese speaker, Wang has also served as China's ambassador in Tokyo and head of China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office.
The country's largely rubber stamp parliament approved Wang's job in a mostly ceremonial vote in the Great Hall of the People with reporters present.
State councillors, who report to the Cabinet, are more senior than the ministers responsible for the same portfolio. While unusual, it is possible to be both a minister and state councillor at the same time.
It was not immediately clear what position former state councillor Yang Jiechi would get. Diplomatic sources said previously he may have become a vice premier, but his name was not included in the list for that position. 
Yang still sits on the Communist Party's Politburo, the second-largest of the party's elite ruling bodies, meaning he will retain an influential voice in China's foreign policy. 
Previously China's foreign minister himself, Yang speaks perfect English but has a low-key public profile and rarely talks to foreign reporters.
Yang has served as one of China's main go-betweens with the Trump administration, with his deep knowledge of the United States coming from previous stints in the Chinese embassy in Washington, including as ambassador from 2000-2004.
Newly appointed Vice President Wang Qishan, a key ally of President Xi Jinping, is likely to have handling the Trump administration and festering trade tensions between the two countries as part of his job.
China also gets a new defense minister, Wei Fenghe, who already sits on the Central Military Commission which runs China's armed forces. Wei has been appointed to a state councillor as well.

The defense minister is more of a figurehead position, as real power rests with Xi and the Central Military Commission. Wei is the fourth-ranked member of that seven-man body.

BERLIN/WARSAW (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel will emphasize bilateral ties and the need for European unity when she meets with top Polish officials, amid ongoing differences between the allies over Polish judicial reforms, migration and a new gas pipeline.
Merkel will meet with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and President Andrzej Duda on Monday, using her second foreign trip since being sworn in for a fourth term to highlight Germany's commitment to the former Soviet bloc member at a time of heightened tensions with both Russia and the United States.
The German leader must pull off a delicate balancing act - reassuring Poland about Berlin's commitment to NATO military spending targets and enlisting its backing for the European Union, without backing away from EU core principles that have been challenged by Poland's sweeping judicial changes.
The stakes are high, given concerns that gains by anti-migrant parties in Austria and Italy could exacerbate tensions between Brussels and central European countries such as Poland.
Michal Dworczyk, head of the Polish prime minister's office, told private broadcaster TVN24 the two sides had a lot to discuss.
The gas pipeline ""North Stream 2 will be one of the important issues on this meeting agenda, as well as the future of the European Union, the EU future budget and many other issues,"" he said.
The pipeline would ship Russian gas to Germany, avoiding transit through Ukraine. It has Germany's approval, but Poland has urged that Western sanctions be imposed on it .
Polish government spokeswoman Joanna Kopcinska said Warsaw hoped for ""a good and pragmatic cooperation with Berlin.""
German government officials say they are upbeat, given Poland's growing concerns about Russian military aggression, uncertainty about U.S. policy shifts, and Warsaw's pending loss of Britain as an ally opposing further euro zone expansion.
""Merkel has the chance to make clear to the Polish government that Europe's democrats must stand together against Putin and Trump, also for the sake of Poland,"" said Franziska Brantner, foreign policy spokeswoman for the German Greens.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, a Social Democrat, stressed close ties between the two neighbors during a meeting with Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz on Friday.
The two men urged the revival of the Weimar Triangle, a platform of political cooperation between Germany, France and Poland created in 1991. Foreign ministers from the three countries last met in Weimar in August 2016.
""The visit of Chancellor Merkel shows that Germany cares about good relations with Poland,"" said Michal Baranowski, head of the Warsaw office of the German Marshall Fund. ""(It) shows a desire at the highest level to fix the relationship.""
Ties between Germany and Poland have grown increasingly strained since the since the nationalist conservative Law and Justice Party (PiS) came to power in Warsaw in 2015, with Berlin rejecting calls by PiS for German war reparations.
The two countries are also at odds over the North Stream II gas pipeline project and Poland's refusal to take in asylum seekers under an EU-wide quota system.

939,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2018 05:40PM ET</span>",Putin says 'nonsense' to think Russia would poison spy in Britain,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday it was nonsense to think that Moscow would have poisoned former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, who are critically ill in a British hospital.
Britain has said that Skripal and his daughter were poisoned by the Soviet-era 'Novichok' nerve agent, and British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Sunday that Russia has been stockpiling it and investigating how such weapons could be used in assassinations.
But Putin, in his first detailed comments on the poisoning, said Russia had been falsely accused.
""As for the tragedy that you mentioned, I found out about it from the media. The first thing that entered my head was that if it had been a military-grade nerve agent, the people would have died on the spot,"" Putin told reporters.
""Secondly, Russia does not have such (nerve) agents. We destroyed all our chemical weapons under the supervision of international organizations, and we did it first, unlike some of our partners who promised to do it, but unfortunately did not keep their promises,"" Putin said.
Despite the tensions, Putin said Moscow was ready to cooperate with London. 
""... We are ready to cooperate, we said that straight away, we are ready to take part in the necessary investigations, but for that there needs be a desire from the other side, and we don't see that yet. But we are not taking it off the agenda, joint efforts are possible.""
""As a whole, of course, I think any sensible person would understand that it would be rubbish, drivel, nonsense, for Russia to embark on such an escapade on the eve of a presidential election. It's just unthinkable.""
Putin was speaking after winning a new term in a presidential election. 
British officials have said Moscow was culpable for the poisoning and expelled 23 Russian diplomats based in London.

Moscow retaliated on Saturday by expelling the same number of British diplomats from Moscow, shuttering the British consulate in Russia's second city of St Petersburg and closing down the Russian activities of the British Council, which promoted British culture overseas.

The small and impoverished Central Africa nation has been unstable since 2015, when Nkurunziza decided to seek a third term in office that his opponents said was unconstitutional.
The referendum will decide whether to amend the constitution to extend presidential terms to seven years from five. 
The proposed changes would limit the president to two consecutive terms but would not take into account previous terms, potentially extending Nkurunziza's rule to 2034.
""The draft constitution submitted to the referendum will be adopted if the absolute majority of votes or fifty percent plus one vote, approve it,"" Nkurunziza said in a statement issued by his office announcing the date.
Several leaders around Africa have sought to void laws or use other tactics to thwart opponents and prolong their reigns beyond constitutional limits, sometimes for decades.
Those who opposed Nkurunziza's third five-term launched an armed struggle against his government, and the resulting violence has left hundreds dead and forced at least 400,000 people into exile.
Regional efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict have dragged on without results so far.
This month, the ruling CNDD-FDD decided to give Nkurunziza the title of ""CNDD-FDD Party Visionary"" after appraising his ideas and teachings. 
The title has no specific role attached to it and appeared to be aimed at shoring up support for the president ahead of the referendum.

941,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2018 03:11PM ET</span>",Mexico leftist says he would try to halt energy auctions if president-elect,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's leftist presidential front-runner said on Sunday that if he wins the July election, he will ask President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop at least two energy auctions scheduled to take place before the new president takes office.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is a long-time skeptic of Pena Nieto's energy reform, enshrined in 2014, and he and his team have delivered fluctuating messages on what they would do if they win. Foreign investors and energy companies are paying close attention to what might happen in one of the most important, and recently opened, energy markets in the Americas. 
There are two official authorized oil auctions - in July and September - that could be threatened by Lopez Obrador's comments, and the energy ministry wants to squeeze in another before Pena Nieto leaves office, although it has yet to be given the green light.
Speaking in Mexico City on the 80th anniversary of the nationalization of the country's oil industry, Lopez Obrador also said that within three years of his possible six-year term, Mexico would stop buying foreign fuel, following extensive upgrades of the country's refining sector. 
His government would also stop selling crude abroad to focus on value-added fuel production, he added.
""I'm going to ask (Pena Nieto) that he doesn't hand out any more oil blocks, neither onshore or shallow waters, and that he puts a stop to the privatization of oil and electricity sectors,"" Lopez Obrador said.
If Lopez Obrador wins the July 1 vote, he would take office on Dec. 1.
Since the energy reform was enacted, Mexico has conducted eight oil and gas auctions, awarding some 90 contracts covering onshore and offshore acreage.
The energy reform ended state oil company Pemex's nearly 80 years of monopoly control over the sector and paved the way for the auctions, ending a long-standing constitutional prohibition on private companies operating fields on their own.
Lopez Obrador, who enjoys a double-digit poll lead over his rivals, also gave a clear indication of what his government's larger energy polices would be.
""I'm committed to having stopped buying foreign fuels by midway through the next six-year term, because we're going to rehabilitate the six existing refineries and we will build two big refineries,"" he said. 

""We're not going to sell crude oil abroad. We're going to process all the raw material in our country to lower the price of fuel.""

943,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2018 02:10PM ET</span>",Peru president says he used offshore firm to legally avoid U.S. taxes: audio,"By Mitra Taj and Marco Aquino
LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's embattled President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski told a congressional investigative committee that he used a company in the British Virgin Islands to legally avoid paying U.S. taxes, according to audio heard by Reuters on Sunday.
Kuczynski made the disclosure during more than seven hours of questioning on Friday as he tried to disentangle himself from a growing corruption scandal less than a week before a new impeachment vote in Congress.
A former Wall Street banker who is married to an American, Kuczynski told the committee that the offshore company, Dorado Asset Management Ltd, was controlled by his daughter and helped him sidestep U.S. taxes on his properties in Peru.
""Why would we pay Uncle Sam and Mr. Trump a bunch of money that's here in Peru?"" Kuczynski is heard telling the committee in a four-minute segment of the audio recording from the closed session.
Kuczynski will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump, who himself has called tax avoidance ""smart,"" at a gathering of the region's leaders in Lima next month.
In response to the recording, one of Kuczynski's attorneys who was present during the session, Gonzalo del Rio, told Reuters the transaction was legal and praised Kuczynski for being willing to discuss his personal finances with the committee despite the heated political climate.
Karina Beteta, the opposition congresswoman who asked Kuczynski about Dorado, confirmed the contents of the recording were accurate.
Despite being legal, tax avoidance schemes have faced a wave of criticism since the 2016 publication of the Panama Papers, an investigation into the shadowy world of offshore holdings and hidden wealth by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
Kuczynski held U.S. citizenship before renouncing it to run for president in 2016, when he was elected on hopes he would use his private sector experience to clean up government corruption.
But less than two years into his term, Kuczynski's wealth and financial history has come under increasing scrutiny as opposition lawmakers accuse him of colluding with Odebrecht [ODBES.UL], a Brazilian construction company under investigation for bribery.
'DIE POOR'
A report by Peru's banking superintendent this week found Kuczynski registered the sale of his house in Lima to Dorado for $695,000 in 2006, before the company relocated to Peru under Kuczynski's control nearly a decade later.
When asked about the property sale, Kuczynski told the committee ""it's very simple. In the United States there's a big tax if you give up your citizenship, and the less property you have, the less you have to pay,"" Kuczynski said. ""So I have to offload my property or I die poor.""
Opposition lawmakers in the committee said Kuczynski's use of the offshore company only raised new questions about his moral fitness for holding public office.
""I'm more convinced than ever that the impeachment motion must succeed,"" Beteta said in an interview.
Beteta added that Kuczynski was unable to provide evidence that he relinquished management of his consulting firm, Westfield Capital Ltd, before it signed business deals with Odebrecht while Kuczynski was a finance minister in the early 2000s.
The banking superintendent report said Westfield agreed to provide financial advising services on three Odebrecht projects within a year of Kuczynski becoming finance minister in 2004.
Del Rio said Kuczynski relinquished management of Westfield via a verbal agreement with a business associate and never worked as a financial adviser while holding public office.
Until December, Kuczynski had denied having professional links to Odebrecht and has since said there was nothing improper or illegal about them.
""The president's professional and public career has always been carried out transparently, within the banking system and paying corresponding taxes,"" Kuczynski's office said in a statement on Friday.
Congress will vote on whether to force Kuczynski from office on Thursday. A similar impeachment motion failed passage by eight votes in December. 

If Kuczynski is impeached in a vote on Thursday, Vice President Martin Vizcarra would replace him as president.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi spoke at length about her country's troubled western state of Rakhine at a Sydney conference on Sunday and appealed to Southeast Asian neighbors for help, Australia's prime minister said.
    ""We discussed the situation in Rakhine state at considerable length today,"" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told reporters at the end of a summit of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Australia, much of it held behind closed doors.
""Daw Aung San Suu Kyi addressed the matter comprehensively at some considerable length herself... She seeks support from ASEAN and other nations to provide help from a humanitarian and capacity-building point of view,"" he said, using a Burmese honorific.
Suu Kyi's spokesman, Zaw Htay, was not immediately available for comment on Turnbull's comments.
Turnbull did not tell reporters whether Suu Kyi gave details of what support she was seeking or whether she spoke specifically about violence against the Rohingya, however ASEAN's Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance has been providing some aid since October.
U.N. officials say nearly 700,000 Muslim Rohingya have fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar to Bangladesh after militant attacks on Aug. 25 last year sparked a crackdown, led by security forces, in Rakhine that the United Nations and United States have said constitutes ethnic cleansing.
The U.N. independent investigator on human rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, said in Geneva this month she saw growing evidence to suspect genocide had been committed.
Myanmar denies the charges and has asked for ""clear evidence"" of abuses by security forces.
Since coming to power in 2016, Suu Kyi - who won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for her struggle for democracy - has failed to condemn the violence against the Rohingya.
Australia's attorney general on Saturday rejected a private bid by activist lawyers to have Suu Kyi face charges for crimes against humanity, saying she has diplomatic immunity.
In response to questions posed by Reuters about the lawyers' move, Suu Kyi spokesman Zaw Htay said earlier in the day such ""pressure"" was unhelpful in solving the conflict in Rakhine, which he called ""the Bengali problem"" - using a term to describe the Rohingya that suggests they are interlopers from Bangladesh. 
Militants from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) had instigated the violence with attacks on government forces in October 2016 and August 2017, said Zaw Htay, director general at the State Counsellor's Office in Myanmar's capital, Naypyitaw.
""All of this happened because of ARSA. The government did nothing,"" he said in response to a question about the legal move.
""Those who are putting pressure like this need to be careful that doesn't become encouraging terrorists.""
Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said it was a ""complex inter-communal situation"" which ASEAN leaders would continue to discuss ""frankly"".
""It's an issue which is also in the public attention and it's one of those where intense public attention sometimes makes it more difficult to solve,"" he added.

Suu Kyi's attendance at the ASEAN summit, hosted by Australia despite it not being a member of the 10-nation bloc, drew street protests in Sydney on Saturday.

Long-serving Prime Minister Robert Fico resigned last Thursday after his leftist Smer party and coalition partners agreed to hand the reins to his deputy after the murder of an investigative journalist provoked the country's biggest protests since the fall of communism. Fico's interior minister also quit this week.
However, the government revamp aimed at keeping the three-party coalition in power failed to quell public anger and tens of thousands of Slovaks rallied across the country for a third consecutive Friday, demanding early elections.
Organizers of the protests on Friday called for a non-partisan nominee as new interior minister to ensure unbiased investigation of the death of Jan Kuciak, 27, and his fiancee, who were found shot dead at home last month. 
Speaking on privately-owned Markiza TV on Sunday, Pellegrini said he wants a non-polarizing government and does not want a long-time member of the ruling Smer party or a person with limited experience to be appointed as interior minister.
""I want to inform the president on ministers' names tomorrow or Tuesday and I want parliament to start discussion on the new government's program on Tuesday or Wednesday,"" Pellegrini said. 
According to a coalition deal between the Smer party, the ethnic Hungarian centrist Most-Hid party and center-right Slovak National Party, each will be allowed to pick their ministers. 

Smer's Peter Kazimir is expected to remain as finance minister.

GAZA (Reuters) - Hamas-run security services in Gaza have shut down a cellular company's headquarters over its alleged failure to cooperate in their investigation of a suspected attempt to assassinate the Palestinian prime minister, security officials said on Sunday.
In addition to the closure on Saturday of the Wataniya firm's main office in Gaza, several employees of a second Palestinian mobile operator, Jawwal, were briefly detained as part of the probe into Tuesday's bomb blast, the officials said.
Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah, who is based in the occupied West Bank, was unhurt when a roadside device exploded next to his motorcade shortly after it entered the Gaza Strip via Israel.
He has been spearheading efforts by the Western-backed Palestinian Authority (PA) to reconcile with Hamas, an Islamist group that won control of the Gaza Strip in 2007. There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack.
Despite a unity deal signed in October, differences remain between Hamas and the PA on sharing administrative and security responsibilities in the Gaza Strip.
Sources familiar with the bombing investigation said the rift came into play in the refusal of Wataniya and Jawwal to cooperate in the probe and the security service's subsequent moves against them.
The two companies declined to comment. But the sources said both had conditioned their cooperation on permission from the West Bank-based attorney-general who serves in the Palestinian Authority.
Adnan Dmairi, spokesman for the PA's security services in the West Bank, said the request to the two firms by the Hamas-run security apparatus in Gaza was illegal.
Dmairi, writing on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, echoed demands by Hamdallah last week that Hamas must hand over security responsibilities for Gaza to the PA.
Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum accused Hamdallah of failing to support security services in Gaza in their search for the attackers.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, a source familiar with the investigation said Hamas security services want Wataniya and Jawwal to provide information about the owners of cellular SIM cards.
The source did not elaborate on how the cards might be linked to the attack. Some roadside bombs have detonators triggered by cellular signals.
There appeared to be no disruption to mobile services in Gaza. Although Wataniya's headquarters remained closed on Sunday, a company employee said its other Gaza offices were open.
A Jawwal source said four employees had been questioned and released since Wednesday. The firm has three million subscribers in Gaza and the West Bank.
Wataniya, a subsidiary of Qatar’s Ooredoo Group, has 800,000 West Bank subscribers and launched in Gaza in October.

Duterte's comments during a speech to graduating cadets at the Philippine Military Academy in northern Philippines comes after ICC prosecutors last month opened a preliminary examination into the president's ""war on drugs"", which has led to the death of thousands since it began in July 2016.
The Southeast Asian nation last week notified the United Nations secretary-general of its decision to withdraw from the ICC because of what the outspoken Philippine leader called ""outrageous"" attacks by U.N. officials and violations of due process.
""I will convince everybody now under the treaty to get out, get out,"" Duterte said. ""It is not a document that was prepared by anybody, it's EU-sponsored.""
About 4,000 Filipinos have been killed by police in the past 19 months in a brutal crackdown that has alarmed the international community. Activists believe the death toll is far higher.

Police say those thousands of deaths were during legitimate anti-drugs operations in which the suspects had violently resisted arrest.

ISTANBUL/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies swept into the northwestern Syrian town of Afrin on Sunday, raising their flags in the town center and declaring full control after an eight-week campaign to drive out Kurdish YPG forces.
A spokesman for the rebel fighters said they entered Afrin before dawn, meeting no resistance. A war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said pockets of YPG fighters defied orders to withdraw, but Turkish forces were in control.
The fight for Afrin, a once-stable pocket of northwest Syria, has opened a new front in Syria's multi-sided civil war and highlighted the ever-greater role of foreign powers such as Turkey in the seven-year-old conflict. 
Ankara says Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters are an extension of a militant group waging an insurgency inside Turkey, and vowed to crush what it described as a ""terror corridor"" of YPG-controlled territory along Turkey's southern border with Syria. 
It has threatened to extend the Afrin offensive to another Kurdish-controlled region further east where U.S. forces are stationed alongside the YPG, Washington's ally against Islamic State in Syria.
""Afrin city center is under control as of 8:30 this morning,"" Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told a rally commemorating the World War One Gallipoli campaign, adding that Turkish and Free Syrian Army flags had been raised in the town center.
""Most of the terrorists have already fled with tails between their legs. Our special forces and members of the Free Syrian Army are cleaning the remains and the traps they left behind,"" Erdogan said. ""In the center of Afrin, symbols of trust and stability are waving instead of rags of terrorists.""
An official from the local Kurdish authority raised the prospect of a guerrilla campaign against Turkey, saying Kurdish forces were still present across the Afrin region and would ""strike the positions of the Turkish enemy and its mercenaries at every opportunity.""
""Our forces all over Afrin will become a constant nightmare for them,"" Othman Sheikh Issa, co-chair of the Afrin executive council, said in a televised statement.
STATUE TORN DOWN
A Whatsapp group run by the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces said Turkish and Syrian rebel troops tore down a statue in Afrin, in what it called a ""blatant violation of Kurdish people's culture and history"".
In Turkey, dozens of pro-Kurdish and leftist groups appealed to world powers to press for the Turkish and Syrian rebel forces to withdraw from Afrin and avoid a ""human tragedy"".
Free Syrian Army spokesman Mohammad al-Hamadeen said the fighters entered the town from the north, east and west. Kurdish forces had pulled back to Syrian government-controlled areas around the city of Aleppo, or to the Kurdish-held region east of the Euphrates river, he said.
""Maybe (Afrin) will be cleared by the end of the day -- it's empty of fighters, they cleared out,"" Hamadeen told Reuters.
Turkey's armed forces said that troops were combing the streets for mines and improvised explosive devices. 
Government spokesman Bekir Bozdag said the military campaign would continue to secure areas around Afrin and make sure food and medicine were available.
""We have more to do. But the project of building a terrorism corridor and building a terrorist state is over,"" he said.
The World Food Programme said it was distributing food to 25,000 people in the nearby towns of Nubl and Zahra, including people just arriving from Afrin.
More than 150,000 people fled Afrin in recent days, the Syrian Observatory said, as Turkey pressed on with its campaign despite a U.N. Security Council call for a 30-day ceasefire across Syria.
Ankara said the demand did not apply to Afrin, but its operation has faced criticism in the West.
France's foreign minister said Turkey's concerns for its border security did not justify ""the deep incursion of Turkish troops in the Afrin zone"", which could also weaken international action against remaining Islamic State fighters in Syria. 

France, like the United States, has given arms and training to a YPG-led militia in the fight against Islamic State in Syria, and also has dozens of special forces personnel based in the region.

They will also be the first without Mugabe's name on the ballot since independence from Britain in 1980.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Sunday that Russia has been stockpiling the deadly nerve agent used to poison a Russian former double agent in England and has been investigating how such weapons can be used in assassinations.
Britain has said Russia used the Soviet-era nerve agent called Novichok to attack Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the first known offensive use of such a weapon on European soil since World War Two. Russia has denied any involvement.
""We actually have evidence within the last 10 years that Russia has not only been investigating the delivery of nerve agents for the purposes of assassination, but has also been creating and stockpiling Novichok,"" Johnson told the BBC.
The identification of Novichok as the weapon has become the central pillar of Britain's case for Russia's culpability in the poisoning. Britain and Russia have each expelled 23 diplomats over the attack as relations between the two countries reach a post-Cold War low. 
Skripal, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who betrayed dozens of Russian agents to Britain, and his daughter are fighting for their lives after they were found collapsed on a bench in the city of Salisbury two weeks ago.
Officials from the world's chemical weapons watchdog will arrive in Britain on Monday to investigate the samples used in the attack and the results should be known in about two weeks, Britain's foreign ministry said.
The foreign ministry said that if Russia has been stockpiling nerve agents this would amount to a violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, of which Moscow is a signatory.
Russia's ambassador to the European Union Vladimir Chizhov told the same program that his country has destroyed its reserves of such substances and a British research laboratory could be the source of the nerve agent used in the attack.
Johnson dismissed those claims and said Russia's reaction ""was not the response of a country that really believes itself to be innocent"". 
""Their response has been a mix of smug sarcasm and denial and obfuscation,"" he said.
Skripal and his daughter may have been exposed to the nerve agent used in their attempted assassination through his car ventilation system, intelligence sources told the US television channel ABC news.
The sources said the toxin was used in a ""dust-like powdered form"" and that it circulated through the vents of the car, the channel said. 
Johnson said Britain's National Security Council will meet later this week to decide ""what further measures, if any"" may be taken, and that the government may decide to target Russian wealth in Britain.
The British capital has been dubbed ""Londongrad"" due to the large quantities of Russian money that have poured in since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Some British lawmakers have urged Prime Minister Theresa May to freeze the private assets of senior members in Russian President Vladimir Putin's circle. 

Putin is expected to easily win a presidential election on Sunday which would take him to nearly a quarter of a century in power.

""We are engaged in arranging serious negotiations to guarantee the safety and protection of civilians,"" said Wael Alwan, the Istanbul-based spokesman for Failaq al-Rahman, in a voice recording. 
""The most important points under negotiation are a ceasefire, ensuring aid for civilians and the exit of medical cases and injured people needing treatment outside Ghouta."" 
Alwan said the subject of ""exit and evacuation"" was ""not on the table"".
In a month-long assault, pro-Syrian government forces have marched into much of eastern Ghouta, the last major insurgent bastion around Damascus.
Troops have splintered Ghouta into three besieged zones in one of the bloodiest offensives of the seven-year war.
A number of patients requiring urgent medical attention have been evacuated from the northern pocket and some aid has entered there. This has not yet happened in the southern pocket.

The Syrian army opened a corridor near Hammouriyeh this week and civilians have been making their way out towards army positions on foot, hauling their belongings with them.
OCHA said conditions for those remaining in eastern Ghouta are ""dire"".

SRINAGAR/MUZZAFARABAD (Reuters) - Five members of an Indian family were killed and two injured by shelling from Pakistani troops on Sunday along the Line of Control, the de facto border between India and Pakistan, according to army and police officials.
Both sides were engaging in heavy shelling despite a 15-year-old ceasefire between the nuclear-armed rivals in the area, the officials said.
Nine people were also wounded across the border in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir due to the shelling from India that began late Saturday night, Pakistani officials said on Sunday.
Tension has been running high since an attack on an Indian army camp in India-controlled Kashmir last month in which six soldiers were killed. India blamed Pakistan for the attack and said it would make its rival pay for the ""misadventure"".
The South Asian neighbors have fought two of their three wars since independence in 1947 over Muslim-majority Kashmir, which they both claim in full but rule in part.
Indian Defence spokesman Lt Col Devender Anand said on Sunday that Pakistani troops started the shelling around 7:45 in the morning.
""They are specifically targeting civilian areas,"" Anand said. ""Army troops retaliated strongly and effectively to silence Pakistani guns.""
Director General of Indian Police in Kashmir, S P Vaid said the five people were killed in the village of Devta Dhar when a shell hit the house of Choudhary Mohammad Ramzan.
Ramzan, 45, his wife Malka Bi, 45, and three sons - Muhammad Rehman, 19, Muhammad Rizwan, 18, and Muhammad Razaq, 8 all died, Vaid said.
Two of Ramzan's daughters - Nooren Akhtar, 14, and Marin Akhtar, 7, were critically injured in the incident and were airlifted to a hospital in Jammu, Vaid said.

The tunnel had been cut off during the 2014 Gaza war and Hamas had tried to put it back into operation, a military spokesman said. It had been dug inside the Hamas-ruled enclave several hundred meters away from Israel's border fence.
The Israeli forces did not cross the border to render the tunnel inoperable but used a new technique, Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus told reporters.
""We did not use explosives. It (the tunnel) was filled with a certain material, with a certain compound,"" Conricus said.
A spokesman for Hamas, the dominant Palestinian group in the Gaza Strip and Israel's arch foe, said the military was ""marketing fake achievements"" to boost the morale of soldiers and Israelis living near the enclave.
Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but still maintains tight control of its land and sea borders. Also citing security concerns, Egypt keeps its border with Gaza largely closed.
During the 2014 war, Hamas fighters used dozens of tunnels to blindside Israel's superior forces. Since then, Israel has been working on advanced counter-measures including a sensor-equipped underground wall along the 60-km (36-mile) Gaza border, a $1.1 billion project it aims to complete by mid-2019.
""On the basis of quality intelligence and groundbreaking technology, Israel is destroying Hamas tunnels one-by-one,"" Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said in a statement.
Israel last went public with an operation against a Gaza tunnel in the area in January, saying that the secret passage had also run through neighboring Egypt.

956,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",Majority believe Japan PM bears some responsibility for altered documents: poll,"TOKYO (Reuters) - A majority of Japanese believe Prime Minister Shinzo Abe bears some responsibility for altered documents at the center of suspicions of a cover-up linked to cronyism, according to an opinion poll on Sunday that also showed his support sliding.
In his worst crisis since taking office in 2012, Abe and Finance Minister Taro Aso have been under fire since the finance ministry said on March 12 it had altered records relating to a discounted sale of state-owned land to school operator Moritomo Gakuen, which had ties to Abe's wife, Akie. 
References to Abe, his wife, and Aso were removed from the finance ministry's records of the sale, copies of documents released by the ministry showed. 
Both men have denied any wrongdoing in the affair. 
But 66.1 percent of respondents to a poll conducted by Kyodo news agency on Saturday and Sunday said they felt the premier had some responsibility for the altered documents. Only 25.8 percent said they thought he didn't.
Protesters have flocked to the streets by the prime minister's office every night since the ministry admitted altering the documents, with some 2,000 on Friday calling for Abe and Aso to resign. 
The poll also showed Abe's support slipping by 9.4 percent to 38.7 percent in the two weeks since the last poll was conducted, while 48.2 percent said they did not support him. 
A Friday survey had a similar drop in support but only 40.4 percent said then that they did not support Abe.
Opposition parties are calling for Aso to resign, while the affair could dash Abe's hopes of winning a third three-year term as head of his Liberal Democratic Party in a September party leadership election. Abe took office in December 2012.
Aso has repeatedly refused to resign and has said the responsibility for the land sale lay with Nobuhisa Sagawa, who stepped down as tax chief ten days ago. Sagawa headed the division that submitted the documents before he became tax agency chief in July.

But the finance ministry announced on Friday that Aso will not attend a meeting of G20 finance leaders this week. A ruling party source told Reuters this was so he can address parliament on Monday about the scandal.

North Korea is pursuing its weapons programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions and has boasted of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.
It defends the programs as a necessary deterrent against perceived plans by the United States, which stations 28,500 troops in South Korea, for invasion - a plan the United States denies.
""We strongly urge the DPRK to immediately and fully comply with its obligations under all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions,"" the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Australia said in a joint declaration, using the initials for North Korea's official name.
The country's nuclear and ballistic missile development ""threaten regional and global security"" the declaration added, calling for the ""complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization"" of the nation.
Tensions have eased in recent weeks, coinciding with North Korea's participation in the Winter Olympics held in the South last month.
U.S. President Donald Trump also announced surprise plans to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un before May, after Kim ""committed to denuclearization"", according to South Korea's National Security Office.
""We are cautiously encouraged by these developments,"" Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsein Loong told reporters in Sydney after the publication of the ASEAN declaration.
""The situation on the Korean peninsula is a complicated problem which will take time to resolve, and we hope these recent steps will contribute to lasting peace and stability.""
Australia hosted ASEAN meetings this weekend, despite not being a member of the 10-nation bloc, as it seeks to tighten political and trade ties in the region amid China's rising influence.

The summit focused on fostering closer economic and security ties among ASEAN and Australia, with the nations also railing against protectionist sentiment and calling for ""self-restraint"" in the disputed South China Sea, a regional flashpoint.

959,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2018 02:10AM ET</span>","Ahead of contentious vote, Egypt sets sights on 'fake news'","CAIRO (Reuters) - Mostafa al-Asar's lawyer said he had barely started work on a documentary critical of Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi when police arrested him and charged him with publishing ""fake news"".
The journalist was detained before he had even begun filming, his lawyer said. The government did not respond to requests for comment.
The arrest on Feb. 4 came ahead of a presidential election later this month which Sisi is virtually guaranteed to win. All opposition candidates except one have dropped out citing intimidation, while the remaining challenger has said he supports the president. The election commission says it has been receptive to any complaints and the vote will be fair and transparent.
As the March 26-28 election nears, Egypt has turned its attention to news outlets and journalists it accuses of spreading lies, including some foreign media and even one pro-government commentator.
Authorities say curbing fictitious news is necessary for national security. They regularly accuse outlets of a lack of professionalism in covering Egypt and urge reporters to use only official outlets as sources.
Egyptian prosecutors have long urged that critical outlets should be silenced.
Authorities have now gone further, with the public prosecutor calling for legal action over what he deems fake news, saying the ""forces of evil"" are undermining the Egyptian state.
Makram Mohammed Ahmed, head of Egypt's Supreme Media Council, a state media regulator, voiced concerns about media standards.
""I no longer believe that there's an independent press, or that there's professionalism ... there is a lack of accuracy, whether in Egyptian papers or the foreign press,"" he told Reuters.
Rights groups such as the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE) and the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms say the charge of publishing false news is intended to rein in dissent, targeting journalists, politicians and even pop stars.
The public prosecutor this week announced telephone hotlines for citizens to report ""news relying on lies and rumors"".
Sisi weighed in on March 1, saying that anyone who insults the army or police - and by extension himself as commander in chief - is guilty of treason.
His words prompted lawmakers to consider new legislation that would jail such offenders for up to three years, according to pro-government media.
The debate over media standards heated up last month when the BBC released a report on human rights detailing the alleged forced disappearance of an Egyptian woman who later appeared on a pro-government talk show to refute the claim.
Egypt's government press center said the BBC report was ""flagrantly fraught with lies"" and urged officials to boycott the British public broadcaster.
The BBC said it ""stands by the integrity"" of its reporting teams. A Cairo court has said it will in April hear a case filed by a lawyer over the report, calling for the closure of the BBC's Cairo office.
CAMPAIGN
Egypt's campaign against the media has included state television presenter Khairy Ramadan, whose brief detention of prompted alarmed comments by pro-government talk show hosts who rarely speak out against authorities.
""Khairy Ramadan (and other Egyptian journalists) are not our enemy - he's a national broadcaster,"" TV host Amr Adib said on his nightly show last week.
Ramadan, who was questioned for defaming the police after a segment on an officer's family struggling to get by financially, was released on bail last week. Neither Ramadan or his lawyer could immediately be reached for comment.
Lower-profile reporters have also been held.
According to his lawyer, the documentary maker Asar was setting up interviews for a film about Sisi supporters turned dissidents when he was arrested on his way to work.
""(Asar) was talking to a guest to coordinate an interview and the call was recorded and monitored,"" Halim Hanish, his lawyer, said.
Another journalist, Hassan al-Banna, was arrested with him as they rode in a bus together ""simply because he happened to be with Asar,"" Hanish said.
Egypt's Interior Ministry and government press center did not respond to phone calls or Whatsapp messages asking for comment on the allegations of phone tapping and the arrests of journalists.
The two could now face jail after being charged with publishing false news and joining an outlawed organization, typically a reference to the banned Muslim Brotherhood, Fatma Serag, an AFTE lawyer who works with journalists, said.
Figures from the Cairo-based AFTE show that at least six journalists have been arrested in Egypt during the first two months of 2018, and that 18 were arrested in 2017.
""The state is now using (the fake news charge) to harass journalists - anyone that publishes information they don't want,"" Serag said.
Egypt has also blocked hundreds of websites in recent months in increased censorship of online media, AFTE said.
The United Nations rights chief last week criticized Egypt's crackdown on political and press freedom, describing a ""pervasive climate of intimidation"" ahead of the election. The U.N. report said more than 400 media and NGO websites had been blocked. Egypt's foreign ministry dismissed the comments as ""baseless allegations"".
In 2015, Sisi pardoned three Al Jazeera television journalists who had been jailed for three years for operating without a press license and broadcasting material harmful to Egypt. The state news agency said the pardons, which included about 100 prisoners held for other offences, were part of an initiative by Sisi to release a number of young people.

960,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2018 12:20AM ET</span>",Maduro challenger shakes up Venezuela's presidential vote,"By Andrew Cawthorne
CARACAS (Reuters) - At each other's throats for two decades, militants of Venezuela's socialist state and opposition seldom agree on anything. Yet mention the name of presidential candidate Henri Falcon, and both are liable to spit. 
""Traitor!"" cry socialist stalwarts, who cannot forgive the former state governor for breaking with their beloved late leader Hugo Chavez in 2010. 
""Chavista lite!"" say opposition radicals, always suspicious that Falcon came into their ranks as a Trojan horse.
Now that the 56-year-old former soldier is running for president in a May 20 vote, both groups are united in scoffing at his chances.
After all, Falcon is up against not just a powerful President Nicolas Maduro but also an election system widely considered unfair and an opposition boycott that will deprive him of votes. 
And yet, a clutch of opinion polls show Falcon ahead, bolstering his campaign mantra that he is a natural transition candidate with appeal to a moderate majority fed up with political polarization and economic chaos.
Widely-followed pollster Datanalisis, for example, put him more than 10 percentage points ahead in voter intentions. 
""This government is finished,"" Falcon told Reuters, noting how few governments in history had survived hyper-inflation and economic chaos like Venezuela's current crisis.
Opinion surveys in Venezuela are often divergent, politicized and misleading in hindsight. But Falcon, his campaign team and some pundits think he may be able to create an avalanche as the campaign gets underway.
""If we really unite, get organized, construct a single narrative, and instead of discouraging people by asking them to abstain, we call them to vote, there's no way this government can beat us,"" said Falcon.
MADURO'S ADVANTAGES
Despite such optimism and Maduro's unpopularity on the streets, there appear to be plenty of ways for the government to assure victory.
It is ratcheting up welfare handouts and pressure on state workers, has skilfully fomented divisions within the opposition, barred Maduro's two main rivals from standing, brazenly uses state resources in its campaigns, and benefits from a compliant election board. 
The board's head, Tibisay Lucena, is on U.S., EU and Canadian sanctions lists accused of violating democracy. Even its chosen vote machine operator, UK-based Smartmatic, accused her institution of fraud in a vote last year.
""Though Falcon is twice as popular as Maduro and could beat him in a competitive race, the 20 May vote will not be competitive,"" wrote Eurasia consultancy.
In line with his promise of a government of ""national unity"", Falcon is reaching out to opposition leaders like former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles to relax the boycott and join his campaign.
He has picked a Wall Street bank analyst, Francisco Rodriguez, to head his economic team.
And in a nod to his former allies in the ruling ""Chavismo"" movement and a signal to the armed forces that they need not fear him, Falcon may keep Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino should he win, a campaign aide said.
But to win, Falcon needs to convince voters in places like La Vega, a poor hillside 'barrio' of Caracas that is a traditional 'Chavista' stronghold. 
At a bread shop there, chatter revolved around impossibly high food prices and the growing migration of Venezuelans to Colombia. There was next to no enthusiasm either for Falcon or Maduro. 
""I want to vote to change this disaster! But there are no good candidates,"" said Jose Sanchez, 25, an internet cafe worker whose minimum monthly wage - less than $2 at the black market rate - does not even cover diapers for his twin babies. 
""Let's see if Falcon has changed since his Chavista days. I suppose I might vote for him, but only to get rid of Maduro,"" added Sanchez, who voted for the opposition in recent polls. 
'HUNGER PUMMELING US'
Driver Gustavo Isturiz, 56, said he voted for the government in multiple polls since Chavez won office in 1998 but was fed up with rising penury. 
""Hunger is pummeling our stomachs, but the opposition still has no chance,"" he said. ""I can't go over to them until a good candidate appears. I don't like Henri Falcon: he has no political project and he's not inspiring hope."" 
Some in La Vega's winding streets said they were so reliant on state handouts they would not dare to vote against Maduro for fear officials would see their ballot and cancel their benefits. 
Falcon, whose energy is evident in his daily pre-dawn jogs, plans to start street campaigning in the next few days. He vows to keep popular welfare benefits but also open Venezuela's economy along more business-friendly lines. 
His adviser Rodriguez recommends dollarizing the economy, seeking $15-20 billion in annual foreign funding, lowering taxes for oil investors, and dismantling currency controls. 
Falcon faces a tough job persuading western nations to withdraw their objections to the May 20 vote. 
The United States has been vociferous, threatening to extend sanctions on the Maduro government to hit the oil sector if it goes ahead with what critics are calling a ""coronation"" on May 20.
Its top diplomat in Venezuela, Todd Robinson, met with Falcon recently, sources close to the candidate said, trying to persuade him to withdraw as his challenge was undermining U.S. efforts to isolate Maduro. 
Washington seems to be calculating that if Maduro scores a Pyrrhic victory, and is left governing a ravaged economy, military and social pressure will become unbearable.

""If Maduro wins, as looks likely, it will be a very unstable government,"" said Caracas-based consultant Dimitris Pantoulas. ""At home, he is flirting with a coup d'etat and abroad he will be a pariah.""

Seehofer, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's CSU Bavarian allies, made the comments in an interview with German Sunday newspaper Die Welt am Sonntag, days after sparking a public outcry by saying Islam did not belong to Germany.
The former Bavarian premier is keen to show his party is tough on migration abuses ahead of October state elections in Bavaria, to win back voters who defected in large numbers to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the Sept. 24 national election. The AfD has also been critical of the EU.
Seehofer called for continued German border controls as long as the EU is unable to protect its external borders, and criticized the European Commission for what he called a ""moralizing"" tone toward eastern European states who have refused to take in asylum seekers under an EU-wide quota system.
Such an attitude was ""counter-productive,"" Seehofer said, adding, ""Every country has its pride.""
The conservative politician, whose party has long been to the right of Merkel's Christian Democrats, urged the EU to stop making decisions ""over the heads"" of member states.
""The EU commission is often patronizing,"" he told the newspaper. ""We need to put more energy into dialogue on the distribution of refugees. If we keep negotiating patiently, a majority of countries will support (it).""
Other countries could contribute in other ways, perhaps by sending more personnel to the EU borders, or by contributing more for joint border patrols, he said.
Seehofer's remarks could exacerbate tensions in the uneasy new ""grand coalition"" between Merkel's conservatives and the center-left Social Democrats.
Merkel firmly rebuffed Seehofer last week, saying that Germany's 4 million Muslims belonged to the country, as did their religion. Leading SPD members also criticized his remarks on Islam.
Johannes Kahrs, a member of parliament and spokesman for the conservative wing of the SPD, accused Seehofer of using his new ministerial post to campaign for the CSU in Bavaria.

""Building bridges and not digging trenches is the responsibility of all decent Germans,"" he told the Handelsblatt newspaper.

SEOUL/BEIJING (Reuters) - A senior North Korean diplomat left for Finland on Sunday for talks with former U.S. and South Korean officials, Yonhap News Agency reported, amid a series of diplomatic encounters ahead of a possible U.S.-North Korean summit.
North Korea is pursuing its nuclear and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.
It defends the programs as a necessary deterrent against perceived plans by the United States, which stations 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the Korean war, for invasion.
The United States denies such plans. Tensions have eased in recent weeks, coinciding with North Korea's participation in the Winter Olympics held in the South last month.
Choe Kang Il, a deputy director general for North American affairs at North Korea's foreign ministry, plans to attend the ""track 1.5 talks"", according to Yonhap, reflecting planned contact between former U.S. officials and current North Korean ones in a broader bid to end the standoff over North Korea's weapons programs.
South Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement North Korea would participate in the meeting joined by former South Korean officials and academics but did not provide further details. 
The talks in Finland will add to a flurry of diplomatic activity in face of the proposed North Korean summits with South Korea and the United States, respectively, in April and May.
Arriving at a Beijing airport en route to Finland, Choe declined to comment. 
North Korean and Swedish foreign ministers ended three days of talks on Saturday on security on the Korean peninsula in preparation of the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un.
South Korea said on Friday it was seeking high-level talks this month with North Korea to prepare for a summit and that South Korean President Moon Jae-in may meet Trump before the U.S. president's planned meeting with the North Korean leader.
In a telephone call, Moon and Trump both voiced ""cautious optimism"" about efforts to resolve the crisis over North Korea's nuclear weapons.

BEIJING (Reuters) - With pictures of ecstatic citizens standing in applause, happily tearful legislators and even a social media game, China's propaganda drive has kicked into high gear following Xi Jinping's unanimous reappointment as president.
Xi's face dominated the front pages of major Sunday newspapers, many carrying the same editorial from the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily using language once more associated with Mao Zedong to say he was a ""leader loved and respected by the people"" and ""helmsman of the country"".
""The voyage of a great country cannot do without a helmsman,"" the paper wrote.
The military's official People's Liberation Army Daily pledged its loyalty to Xi in its editorial, saying his election would ensure the country's long-term peace and stability. Xi is also head of the armed forces, the world's largest.
There was never any doubt that the largely rubber-stamp parliament would not have re-elected Xi as president on Saturday, especially following a constitutional amendment a week earlier which lifts presidential term limits, meaning Xi can stay on indefinitely.
While the amendment was passed with just six dissenters - two no votes, three abstentions and one invalidated ballot - none of the roughly 3,000 legislators voted against Xi, a point made repeatedly in state media coverage.
State television showed images from the floor in the Great Hall of the People of some legislators in tears after Xi swore an oath to the constitution following his re-election, a vote it described as a ""solemn and sacred historic moment"".
In a moment of high political theater, a copy of the constitution was carried onto the main stage by three members of the armed forces.
Other pictures on state media showed ordinary people standing in applause in front of television screens around the country at Xi's re-appointment.
The government has presented this month's parliament session and its controversial removal of presidential term limits as widely welcomed despite criticism that has evaded the censors and seeped onto Chinese social media at times.
Social media accounts of state media have leapt into action to offer their support, even as the comments sections have either been disabled or only show supportive remarks from users.
Late on Saturday, the People's Daily WeChat account went live with a game where players have 20 seconds to press the screen as many times as they can to register a ""like"" for all the government's achievements of the past five years, Xi's first term in office.
The top-rated comment on Sunday morning was one user proudly saying he had pressed ""like"" 181 times.

""Press like for Uncle Xi!"" wrote another user, using a popular term of endearment for Xi.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican ""Lettergate"" scandal came to a head on Saturday when the Holy See, under pressure from the media and conservatives, released a full text by former Pope Benedict that before was cited only selectively.
The Vatican Secretariat for Communication, which had come under sharp criticism all week for blurring part of a photograph of the letter and for withholding another section, said in a statement there had been ""no intent of censorship"".
It said the letter, written for the presentation of a Vatican-published 11-booklet series on the theology of Pope Francis, was private and therefore officials had cited only the ""opportune and relative"" parts.
But the episode, which has cast a shadow over the Vatican for a week, has proven to be a public relations fiasco, particularly for its communications chief, Monsignor Dario Vigano.
At the book presentation on Monday, Vigano read out the parts of the letter in which Benedict rejected the ""stupid prejudice"" of those who say Francis' theology is lacking.
Benedict also disputed suggestions by conservatives that Francis' academic qualities were lacking, praising his successor as a ""man of deep philosophical and theological formation"" and finding an ""interior continuity between the two pontificates"".
But a press release handed out at the event omitted a paragraph in which Benedict apologized for not having had the time to read all 11 volumes and thus declining a request to write a ""short and dense theological"" introduction for the series.
The final paragraph, released for the first time on Saturday, went further, showing that Benedict was irritated by the fact German theologian Peter Hunermann had been chosen by the Vatican publishing house LEV to write one of the volumes.
Hunermann, Benedict noted had ""led anti-papal initiatives"" during Benedict's 2005-2013 papacy and had also attacked some of the writings of Pope John Paul II, who died in 2005.
""I am certain that you will understand my denial (of the request to write an introduction),"" Benedict tells Vigano.
Luis Badilla, who writes for the Vatican-affiliated website Il Sismografo, issued a thinly veiled call for Vigano's head, calling the whole episode ""a gigantic mess"". In an editorial on Saturday, Badilla said Vigano and the head of the Vatican's publishing house, Father Bruno Cesareo, ""have some explaining to do"" and that ""consequences must be drawn"".
Conservative critics of Francis saw the blurring and the selective citings from the letter as part of a plot to censor the thoughts of the former pope.

Many conservative Catholics still look up to Benedict as a bulwark against liberals, and have lambasted Francis for being too lenient on divorced Catholics and homosexuals.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain should consider a limited extension to its exit process from the European Union if needed to ensure details of its future relationship with the bloc are agreed, a committee of lawmakers said in a report.
Prime Minister Theresa May formally notified the EU of Britain's intention to leave by triggering Article 50 of the membership treaty on March 29 2017, setting the clock ticking on a two-year exit process.
Britain has said it wants to have the basis of a trade deal set out with the EU by October, but the Exiting the EU Committee said in a report published on Sunday that deadline would be tight.
""In the short time that remains, it is difficult to see how it will be possible to negotiate a full, bespoke trade and market access agreement, along with a range of other agreements, including on foreign affairs and defense cooperation,"" the committee said.
""If substantial aspects of the future partnership remain to be agreed in October, the government should seek a limited extension to the Article 50 time to ensure that a political declaration on the future partnership that is sufficiently detailed and comprehensive can be concluded.""
The report also said the length of any post-Brexit transition agreed between Britain and the EU should be possible to prolong if necessary.
Britain has said it is confident it can reach a deal on the transition period at an EU summit later this month. It expects the transition to last around two years after its departure date, although the European Union has said it should be shorter, ending on Dec. 31, 2020.
The Exiting the EU committee, made up of lawmakers from all the main political parties, also called on the government to present a detailed plan on how a ""frictionless"" border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would work.

The Irish border is a key sticking point in negotiations between the UK and the EU, as Britain has said it wants to leave the customs union but does not want a ""hard"" land border with customs checks.

Two U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity and citing initial reports, said on Thursday the aircraft crashed near al-Qaim, a town in Anbar province close to the Syrian border.
The United States says it has about 5,200 troops in Iraq that are part of a coalition fighting Islamic State militants.

968,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2018 07:14PM ET</span>",Putin on track for commanding win as Russians head to polls,"PETROPAVLOVSK-KAMCHATSKY, Russia (Reuters) - Russians began voting in a presidential election on Sunday set to give Vladimir Putin a commanding victory that could only be blemished if large numbers do not bother taking part because the result is so predictable.
On Russia's eastern edge, in the Pacific coast city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, polling stations opened at 2000 hrs GMT, and voting across the vast country will run until polls close at the westernmost point, the Kaliningrad region, 22 hours later.
Opinion polls give Putin, the incumbent, support of around 70 percent, or nearly 10 times the backing of his nearest challenger. Another term will take him to nearly a quarter century in power — a longevity among Kremlin leaders second only to Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
Many voters credit Putin, a 65-year-old former KGB spy, with standing up for Russia's interests in a hostile outside world, even though the cost is confrontation with the West. 
A row with Britain over allegations the Kremlin used a nerve toxin to poison a Russian double agent in a sleepy English town — denied by Moscow — has not dented his standing.
The majority of voters see no viable alternative to Putin: he has total dominance of the political scene and the state-run television, where most people get their news, gives lavish coverage of Putin and little airtime to his rivals.
""He (Putin) is our president. We take pride in him,"" said Marianna Shanina, a resident of the Crimea region. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine four years ago, earning Putin admiration from many Russians and condemnation from the West.
""We wish him victory at the election. Our whole family will vote for Putin. Putin! Good health to you, beloved president!,"" Shanina said at a Putin election rally.
SHOO-IN CONTEST
A March 9 survey by state-run pollster VTsIOM gave Putin, who was first elected president in 2000, support of 69 percent. His nearest rival Pavel Grudinin, the Communist Party's candidate, is on just 7 percent.
The first politician in years to challenge the Kremlin's grip on power, Alexei Navalny, is barred from the race because of a corruption conviction he says was fabricated by the Kremlin.
He is calling for a boycott of the election, saying it is an undemocratic farce, and deploying supporters to collect evidence of anyone rigging the ballot to inflate turnout and support for Putin. The Kremlin and election officials say any fraud will be stamped out. 
Kremlin officials privately acknowledge a worry that some of Russia's 110 million eligible voters will not bother casting ballots because they believe Putin is a shoo-in. A low turnout would diminish his authority in his next term, which, under the constitution, has to be his last.
""There is no intrigue. I do not see any point for me in going to the election,"" said Alexei Khvorostov, a resident of Krasnodar, in southern Russia.
In an address to the nation broadcast on national television on Friday, Putin said voters held the fate of the country in their hands.
""I therefore ask you to come to the polling stations on Sunday, use your right to choose a future for the great Russia that we love."" 
In Khabarovsk region, on Russia's Pacific coast, local officials delivered supplies of eggs, tinned peas, and frozen pike to polling stations. It will be sold to voters on polling day at a discount of between 10 and 30 percent compared to prices in local shops.

""By doing this we hope to attract voters to the polling stations and we think we can increase turnout,"" said Nikolai Kretsu, chairman of the consumer market committee in the regional administration. ""The second objective is to strengthen allegiance towards the authorities.""

MALE (Reuters) - Police in Maldives arrested at least 139 opposition protesters, its spokesman said on Saturday, as they attempted to defy orders under the state of emergency and march into the high security zone in capital Male. 
Maldives President Abdulla Yameen has extended the state of emergency for 30 days through March 22 after declaring it on Feb. 5 following an order by the Supreme Court for nine opposition leaders to be released.
The protesters are calling for the arrest of Yameen and for the Supreme Court ruling, which the president has defied, to be enforced.
Police spokesman Ahmed Shifan told Reuters that 141 people were arrested in protests late on Friday, though two men were subsequently released. 
Witnesses said masked special operations policemen arrested several protesters, while riot police charged with shields and used pepper spray and tear gas to break up the protests.
The arrest came after authorities warned last week that the protests would not be allowed, saying that police had received word that there was an attempt to violently overthrow the government and create unrest.
Rights group Amnesty International said, Maldivian authorities are using the state of emergency as a licence for heightened repression and the 139 people have been detained ""solely for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly"".
""They must be released immediately and unconditionally,” Omar Waraich, Amnesty's deputy South Asia director said in a statement.
Police accused a protester of fracturing an officer’s arm in a tweet and said: ""A policemen is injured after being attacked by a protester. The policemen has a fracture in his hand.""
The government has said that there were no plans to extend the state of emergency after it expires on March 22.

Since Albania embraced democracy in 1990, many Albanians have chosen to migrate for a better life, even paying hefty sums to smugglers. Now they can travel freely in and out of the European Union's Schengen zone, but still need visas for Britain and North America.
National police chief Ardi Veliu said seven criminal groups operating in Albania, Bulgaria, Spain, France, the Dominican Republic, Italy, Britain, Ireland, the United States and Canada had smuggled some 1,000 people to Britain, the United States and Canada.
""Every person paid at least 7,000 pounds ($9,764) to get to the United Kingdom and from $24,000 to $30,000 to reach the U.S. and Canada,"" Veliu told reporters.
He said the group had forged passports for those traveling and helped them reach their destinations by traveling via other European countries, or through the Dominican Republic or other countries in South America.
Veliu said Albanian police had worked with U.S. colleagues and European agencies as well as with Interpol and EUROPOL. 
In a drive to convince the European Union to agree to start accession negotiations this June, Albania has stepped up its fight against crime and has lately seized 613 kilos of cocaine and busted a large cannabis smuggling group.

The website describes itself as ""a dossier on the world's leading state sponsor of extremism"" and refers several times to what it considers Qatar's support for terrorists and terrorist groups.
Operators of the accounts mentioned in the lawsuit could not immediately be reached on Saturday for comment.
The government communications office said the defendants, who it identified as John Does 1-10, have used their anonymity to spread negative information, causing irreparable harm and injury to its operations and reputation.
It also said about 5 percent of Twitter followers of @QatarExposed are automated ""bots,"" which means most of the false statements are spread to real accounts and people.
""Defendants' social media posts and attacks do not constitute opinion or protected political speech in its substance, content and purpose,"" the complaint said.

Zuma, who was forced to resign by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) last month, was at the center of a 1990s deal to buy European military kit that has cast a shadow over politics in South Africa for years.
Chief state prosecutor Shaun Abrahams told a media conference on Friday that Zuma's attempts to head off the charges hanging over him for more than a decade had failed.
He said the 75-year-old Zuma denies all the allegations against him.
Zuma's lawyer Michael Hulley said the reason behind Abrahams' decision was not clear from the ""one-page and somewhat terse response"" received from him ""advising that the representations made on behalf of Zuma were unsuccessful,"" eNCA said on its news website.
""In the circumstances, the likely course of action would be to take the decision of the NDPP (National Director of Public Prosecutions) on review. The decision will however only be made after careful consideration and consultation with Mr Zuma,"" Hulley was quoted as saying in a screengrabbed text.
Zuma will face 16 charges relating to 783 instances of alleged wrongdoing, National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku said on Friday.

Twelve are of fraud, one of racketeering, two of corruption and one of money laundering.

North Korea's Ri Yong Ho arrived in Stockholm on Thursday for talks with his Swedish counterpart Margot Wallstrom amid a flurry of diplomatic activity concerning the reclusive country and its nuclear ambitions. 
Trump reaffirmed on Friday that he was willing to meet Kim after South Korean officials passed on an invitation earlier this month. North Korea has so far not publicly acknowledged the invitation.
""The foreign ministers discussed opportunities and challenges for continued diplomatic efforts to reach a peaceful solution to the conflict as well as bilateral relations,"" the Swedish foreign ministry said in a statement after Ri and Wallstrom wound up their talks.
""Sweden underlined the need for North Korea to dismantle its nuclear arms and missiles program in line with several Security Council resolutions.""
No U.S. government officials participated in the talks this week in Sweden, a State Department official said.
The Central Intelligence Agency has taken the lead on organizing potential discussions between the U.S. and North Korea, The New York Times reported on Saturday. The head of the CIA, Mike Pompeo, has been named as a successor to run the State Department in the wake of the ouster of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
The talks in Stockholm had initially been scheduled to conclude on Friday but were extended into the weekend.
""The dialogue has been constructive,"" a source with knowledge of the discussions said. ""It should be seen as a positive sign that the meeting was extended (until Saturday).""
The source said that Sweden had been in close touch with the United States and South Korea before the Stockholm meetings and hoped the talks would lead to further progress towards defusing tensions.
""Sweden will continue to do what it can, but it is the protagonists themselves who have to drive the process forward,"" the source said.
In the wake of the Stockholm talks, Wallstrom will meet her South Korean counterpart Kang Kyung-wha, who was in Washington this week for talks on North Korea and trade, in Brussels on Monday, Wallstrom's spokesman said. 

Sweden is one of a handful of countries considered a possible venue for a meeting between Trump and Kim, who have engaged in bellicose mudslinging over North Korea and its nuclear arms program.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's attorney general said that Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has diplomatic immunity, rejecting a bid by activist lawyers to prosecute her for crimes against humanity over the country's treatment of minority Rohingya Muslims.
Nearly 700,000 Rohingya fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar to Bangladesh after militant attacks on Aug. 25 last year sparked a crackdown led by security forces in the western state of Rakhine that the United Nations and United States have said constituted ethnic cleansing.
Myanmar denies the charge. It has asked for ""clear evidence"" of abuses by security forces. After repeated attempts, neither Suu Kyi's spokesman nor the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was available for comment.
Australian Attorney General Christian Porter said he would not allow the prosecution of Suu Kyi, who arrived in Sydney on Saturday for regional talks, because heads of state cannot be arrested, detained or served with court proceedings.
""Aung San Suu Kyi has complete immunity, including from being served with court documents, because under customary international law, heads of state, heads of government and ministers of foreign affairs are immune from foreign criminal proceedings and are inviolable,"" Porter told Reuters by email.
The legal action in Australia coincided with the start of Association of Southeast Asian Nations meetings.
Australia is hosting the meetings, despite not being a member of the 10-nation bloc, as it seeks to tighten political and trade ties in the region amid China's rising influence.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi's invitation has sparked protests, which included about 100 activists gathering in Sydney's Hyde Park where they chanted ""Aung San Suu Kyi, shame on you"".

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Friday he would raise the issue of human rights abuses with Suu Kyi during her three-day visit.

MIAMI (Reuters) - Engineers and state and university officials met hours before a newly built pedestrian bridge collapsed, killing six people, but concluded that a crack in the bridge was not a safety concern, Florida International University said on Saturday.
The two-hour meeting on Thursday involved FIGG, which is the private contractor for the overall design of the bridge, the school, Florida Department of Transportation officials and Munilla Construction Management (MCM), which installed the bridge.
A FIGG engineer ""concluded there were no safety concerns and the crack did not compromise the structural integrity of the bridge,"" FIU said in a statement on Saturday. 
About three hours after the meeting concluded, the 950-ton, $14.2 million bridge fell down, crushing vehicles stopped at a traffic light on the eight-lane roadway below. At least six people, including three whose bodies were recovered on Saturday, were killed. Police said four vehicles are believed to be still under the collapsed bridge and more bodies may be recovered from the rubble.
News of the meeting followed a revelation late on Friday that the engineer overseeing the bridge, which linked the FIU campus with the city of Sweetwater, had called a state official two days before the collapse to report cracks.
However, the voicemail message from FIGG's lead engineer Denney Pate, including his assertion that the cracking posed no safety issue, was not retrieved until Friday, a day after the tragedy, according to the state transportation agency.
Pate did not immediately respond to email queries from Reuters. 
In the message, Pate said his team had observed ""some cracking"" at one end of the bridge and that repairs were warranted, ""but from a safety perspective we don't see that there's any issue there, so we're not concerned about it from that perspective.""
He added: ""Obviously the cracking is not good and something's going to have to be, ya know, done to repair that.""

The bill, which is non-binding, would have gone into effect on Saturday morning, even if Trump had not signed it.
The move adds to strains between the two countries over trade, as Trump has enacted tariffs and called for China to reduce its huge trade imbalance with the United States, even while Washington has leaned on Beijing to help resolve tensions with North Korea.
In a statement, China's Foreign Ministry said it had lodged ""stern representations"" with the United States, saying the law sent a ""seriously wrong signal"" to the forces of Taiwan independence.
""We urge the U.S. side to correct its mistake, stop official exchanges between U.S. and Taiwan officials and substantively raising relations, and prudently and appropriately handle the Taiwan issue to avoid causing serious harm to Sino-U.S. ties and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait region.""
China considers self-ruled and democratic Taiwan to be a wayward province ineligible for state-to-state relations.
China's hostility towards Taiwan has risen since the election of President Tsai Ing-wen, of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, in 2016.
It suspects Tsai wants to push for formal independence, which would cross a red line for Communist Party leaders in Beijing, though Tsai has said she wants to maintain the status quo and is committed to ensuring peace.
Taiwan's government has welcomed the new U.S. legislation, saying it looks forward to continuing to deepen its relationship with Washington.
Taiwan's presidential office said in a statement earlier on Saturday that the United States was Taiwan's most important ally and thanked the country for its steadfast support.
The United States does not have formal ties with Taiwan but is required by law to help it with self-defense and is the island's primary source of weapons. 

Defeated Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Chinese civil war to the Communists.

Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, made the comment during a meeting with Oman’s foreign minister, Yusuf bin Alawi, in Tehran.
""The shared view of Iran and Oman about the Yemen crisis is that the war must end quickly with the beginning of a ceasefire, the ending of the siege, sending humanitarian help and the beginning of Yemeni-Yemeni dialogue for the development of new political structures based on the vote and desires of the people of Yemen,"" Shamkhani said. 
Saudi Arabia and its adversaries in Yemen’s armed Houthi movement are holding secret talks to try to end a three-year-old war that has unleashed a major humanitarian crisis, diplomats and Yemeni political sources have said.     
A Saudi-led coalition is fighting to counter the influence of Riyadh’s arch-foe Iran, an ally of the Houthis, who deny any help from Tehran and say they are fighting a revolution against corrupt politicians and Gulf powers in thrall to the West.
Separately, Shamkhani said Iran’s missile program was not up for negotiation and that the Islamic Republic would respond to any American action against a 2015 nuclear deal.
Iran agreed to curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of a number of sanctions under the deal.
Britain, France and Germany have proposed fresh EU sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missiles and its role in the war in Syria in a bid to persuade Washington to preserve the deal with Tehran, Reuters reported on Friday.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's governing Liberal party has won a tight regional election in South Australia, a victory that could deal a blow to national renewable energy plans. 
Saturday's poll pitted the conservative Liberals against the state's ruling center-left Labor party, while independent Nick Xenophon's new party SA Best failed to win the balance-of-power and have the final say over which major party governs.
Incoming Liberal premier Steven Marshall gave his televised victory speech just after 10 p.m. local time. 
""It is a tough job, but I tell you what, I'm really looking forward to it .... It's a new dawn for South Australia.""
With 63 percent of votes counted, it was expected the Liberals had won 24 of the 47 lower house seats, giving it a majority to form government in what may have national implications for renewable energy policy.
The vote was seen as a choice between solar and wind energy, pushed by Labor, and coal, backed by Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's conservative government.
South Australia, the country's fifth most populous state, has the most wind and solar power but the highest electricity prices in the country.
Its 1.7 million citizens suffered repeated blackouts over the last two years when intermittent wind power was insufficient and back-up power from coal and gas was unavailable.
Outgoing Labor premier Jay Weatherill had announced a plan in February to create a network of 50,000 home solar systems backed by Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Powerwall batteries.
Turnbull mocked the state's renewables policy as a ""reckless energy experiment"" that created the highest electricity prices in the developed world.
The federal government wants to introduce a national energy policy that has no renewable energy target but sets requirements for emissions cuts and reliability. South Australia's Labor government had refused to go along with it.
Energy policy specialist David Blowers at the Grattan Institute think-tank told Reuters last week that if the Liberals were to win in South Australia, the federal government could be expected to get the approval it needs to proceed.
The South Australia Liberal party also used a data-mining computer program to intensify lobbying in marginal seats for the first time in this election.
The i360 app imported from the United States uses information gleaned from social media, polls and surveys to pinpoint vacillating voters' addresses and the issues they care about in key marginal seats so they can be targeted for lobbying.
If the data-driven widget is credited with the Liberals' victory, it may become more widely used in future elections.
The official result of the final vote tally may not be known for several days.

SAN GIOVANNI ROTONDO, Italy (Reuters) - Pope Francis prayed on Saturday before the body of one of Catholicism's most popular saints, Padre Pio, a mystic monk who is said to have wrestled with the Devil.
It was Francis' first visit as pope to this hill town in southern Italy that is a main stop along the country's pilgrim route linking places where saints are buried.
The bearded Capuchin monk, who died in 1968 after spending most of his life here, is said by the Catholic Church to have had the ""stigmata"" - the bleeding wounds of Jesus on his hands and feet. He wore brown half-gloves to cover the wounds and absorb the blood from his palms.
Many people said Pio knew what they were about to confess. He is said to have told then-bishop Karol Wojytla of Poland in the mid-1960s that he would become pope. Wojtyla became Pope John Paul in 1978 and in 2002 declared Pio a saint.
Padre Pio's biographers say he wrestled with the Devil regularly in his cell in a small monastery that is now the centerpiece of a sprawling complex receiving more than a million pilgrims a year.
Francis made a reference to Pio's battles with the Devil earlier on Saturday when he visited Pietrelcina, the village where Pio was born in 1887.
""His soul was greatly tormented,"" Francis said in improvised remarks. ""He felt assailed by the Devil.""
PILGRIM TRADE
According to monks, the last demonic tussle was in 1964, when they heard him calling from his cell at night.
They found him on the floor, his forehead split open. He told them ""The Devil tried to scratch out my eyes."" 
The next day, the Devil is said to have spoken through a possessed person, saying ""I went to visit somebody. I took revenge.""
Pio's body was exhumed in 2008 and partially reconstructed with a life-like silicone mask. It is preserved in a temperature-controlled glass coffin. Pilgrims toss money and notes to the saint over a wrought-iron fence. 
Thousands of Padre Pio prayer groups exist around the world. One group came from Nashville in the United States.
Pio's fame as a mystic grew in the first half of the 20th century and the town expanded with it, making the pilgrim trade the heart of its economy. Former grazing lands are now dotted with hotels.

Souvenir stalls sell everything from cheap Padre Pio key chains to life-size statues of the saint costing thousands of euros.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Fifteen people, including at least five children, drowned on Saturday when the small boat they were traveling on capsized in the Aegean Sea, Greek coast guard officials said.
The incident occurred off Greece's Agathonisi island, which is close to the Turkish coast. The identity and nationality of the victims was not immediately known. 
""At least four more (migrants) were unaccounted (for),"" a coast guard official told Reuters. Three others were rescued.
Saturday's incident was thought to be the highest death toll of migrants trying to reach outlying Greek islands in months.
Greek authorities said they believed there were 22 people on the boat. Greek coast guard vessels assisted by two helicopters were searching for more survivors.
""We can't tolerate to lose children in the Aegean Sea ... the solution is to protect people, to implement safe procedures and safe routes for migrants and refugees, to hit the human trafficking circuits,"" Greek migration minister Dimitris Vitsas said in a press release.
Hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants flowed into Greece and further west in 2015 from Turkey, making the short but precarious crossing. Hundreds died trying to make it across.
Following a 2016 agreement between the European Union and Turkey, the numbers have diminished. 
Under that deal, anyone who arrives on Greek islands must be returned to Turkey unless they qualify for asylum. But procedures can take several months, leading to overcrowded conditions on the islands.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia expelled 23 British diplomats on Saturday in a carefully calibrated retaliatory move against London, which has accused the Kremlin of orchestrating a nerve toxin attack on a former Russian double agent and his daughter in southern England.
Escalating a crisis in relations, Russia said it was also shutting down the activities of the British Council, which fosters cultural links between the two countries, and Britain's consulate-general in St. Petersburg. 
The Russian Foreign Ministry said it was giving the 23 British diplomats one week to leave the country.
The move, which was tougher than expected, followed Britain's decision on Wednesday to expel 23 Russian diplomats over the attack in the English city of Salisbury which left former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia Skripal, 33, critically ill in hospital.
Moscow announced the measures on the eve of a presidential election which incumbent Vladimir Putin should comfortably win. Putin has cast his country as a fortress besieged by hostile Western powers with him as its defender, and state media is likely to portray the anti-British move in that context. 
The Foreign Ministry said Moscow's measures were a response to what it called Britain's ""provocative actions and groundless accusations"". It warned London it stood ready to take further measures in the event of more ""unfriendly steps"".
Relations between London and Moscow have crashed to a post-Cold War low over the Salisbury attack, the first known offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since World War Two.
The Russian Foreign Ministry summoned the British ambassador, Laurie Bristow, to a meeting on Saturday morning in central Moscow at its Stalin-era headquarters during which he was informed of the retaliatory measures.
Bristow told reporters afterwards that Britain had only expelled the Russian diplomats after Moscow had failed to explain how the nerve toxin had got to Salisbury.
""We will always do what is necessary to defend ourselves,"" the ambassador told reporters.
Britain's foreign ministry said it had anticipated Russia's response and the National Security Council would meet early next week to consider next steps.
""Our priority today is looking after our staff in Russia and assisting those that will return to the UK,"" it said in a statement.
""Russia’s response doesn’t change the facts of the matter - the attempted assassination of two people on British soil, for which there is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian State was culpable."" 
WAR OF WORDS
Russia's response was more robust than expected. The closure of the British Council's Moscow office will sever cultural ties, while that of the consulate-general in St Petersburg will end Britain's diplomatic presence in Russia's second city.
Russian news agencies cited politicians in Russia's upper house of parliament as welcoming the move to close the British Council, alleging it had been used as a cover by British spies.
British lawmaker Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said the move to close the organization's office would hurt the Russian people.
""It’s a great shame for the Russian people that they’re closing the British Council which has done an awful lot to educate Russian people in the English language and to help them get jobs and opportunities around the world,"" he told the BBC. 
Amid calls from British politicians across the spectrum to take further action against Russia, former British ambassador to Russia, Sir Roderic Lyne, told the BBC that Britain should avoid getting dragged into a prolonged show down with Russia.
""I don’t think it would be sensible to get dragged down into a mud wrestling battle with a gorilla,"" Lyne said.
Russia has complained that Britain has failed to provide any evidence of its involvement in the Salisbury attack and has said it is shocked and bemused by the allegations. 
Britain has escalated a war of words with Russia over the incident in recent days. On Friday, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it was overwhelmingly likely that Russian President Vladimir Putin himself had made the decision to use a military-grade nerve toxin to strike down Skripal.
Britain, the United States, Germany and France have jointly called on Russia to explain the attack, while U.S. President Donald Trump has said it looks as if the Russians were behind it.
Russia has said is open to cooperation with Britain, but has refused Britain's demands to explain how Novichok, a nerve agent developed by the Soviet military, was used against the Skripals.
Skripal, a former colonel in the GRU who betrayed dozens of Russian agents to British intelligence, and his daughter have been critically ill since March 4, when they were found unconscious on a bench.
A British policeman was also poisoned when he went to help them and remains in a serious but stable condition.
Russian investigators said on Friday they had opened a criminal investigation into the attempted murder of Yulia Skripal and offered to cooperate with British authorities.
Russia offered some cooperation to British authorities after the 2006 London murder of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko too.
Britain said the assistance in that case was not enough, and in 2016, a judge-led inquiry concluded that Putin had probably approved Litvinenko's murder, something Moscow denies.

Hevi Mustafa, a top member of the civil authority governing the Afrin region, said people were fleeing the main town to other Kurdish-held parts of the region and to government territory.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor, said Turkish warplanes and artillery struck the town overnight, and at least 150,000 had fled since Wednesday.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Thousands of civilians streamed out of their towns to escape battles in the north and south of Syria on Saturday, where two different offensives have prompted an exodus in recent days.
A new wave of at least 10,000 people fled a rebel pocket to army lines in eastern Ghouta near the capital Damascus in the southwest. Rescuers and a monitor said air strikes pounded the besieged zone.
In the northern Afrin region, people ran from other frontlines closing in on their homes as Turkish jets struck the main town, Syrian Kurdish forces and the monitor said. More than 150,000 people have left the town in the last few days, a senior Kurdish official said.
The two offensives - one by the Syrian army with Russia's support, and another led by Turkey with its allied Syrian rebels - entered decisive phases this week. Both have shown how foreign backers and their Syrian allies are reshaping the map after the defeat of Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliphate last year.
Syria's conflict marked seven years this week, after killing hundreds of thousands, displacing at least 11 million more, including nearly 6 million who fled abroad in one of the worst refugee crises of modern times. 
Turkey launched the cross-border offensive on Afrin in January against the Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters that control the region. 
In its own month-long assault, the Syrian military has marched into much of eastern Ghouta, the last big insurgent bastion around Damascus. 
EASTERN GHOUTA
Government forces have splintered Ghouta into three zones in one of the bloodiest offensives of the seven-year war. For the first time, residents began running in their thousands out of the southern pocket, around the town of Hammouriyeh, this week.
State media said 10,000 more civilians reached army positions on Saturday, and some others started leaving the Harasta zone as well in a new outflow. 
Troops and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) would take them to temporary shelters, it said. 
Men, women, and children crossed the front by foot along a dirt road, staggering under the weight of bags and suitcases, footage on state TV showed. Many carried infants on their shoulders or pushed them in strollers. Some elderly people hobbled on wooden sticks. 
The U.N. has said the exact numbers of people exiting are not known, nor are the destinations of all evacuees.
More than 30,000 people left on Saturday, the Interfax news agency cited a center in Syria that Russia's defense ministry runs as saying. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put it at 20,000 so far. 
The UK-based monitoring group said air strikes on Zamalka, in the pocket that has seen the exodus, killed 30 people gathering to leave for government lines. The monitor and local rescuers in rebel territory said warplanes pounded the towns of Kafr Batna and Ain Tarma, as well as Zamalka. 
Damascus and its key ally Moscow say they strike only armed militants and seek to stop insurgent mortar fire that killed dozens in the capital. They have accused the Ghouta factions of preventing people from leaving - which rebels deny. 
AFRIN
An estimated 12,000-16,000 people had already left Ghouta before Saturday, while fighting in Afrin had reportedly displaced more than 48,000, a U.N. aid official in Syria has said.
Turkey's military has pushed the YPG militia back from the border and advanced on the western and eastern flanks of Afrin town itself. Ankara sees the Kurdish forces as an extension of the outlawed Kurdish PKK which has waged a decades-long insurgency inside Turkey.
Turkish air and artillery strikes rained down overnight and in recent days, driving tens of thousands out of the main town, Kurdish authorities and the Observatory have said. 
Hevi Mustafa, a senior member of the civil authority that governs Afrin, said people fled the main town to other Kurdish-held parts of the region and to government territory.
""The situation is tragic for the people inside,"" she said. ""And the displaced outside Afrin are out in the open without refuge or food."" 

The Turkish military denied on Saturday it had struck a hospital in Afrin, and added it was waging the campaign in a way that would not hurt civilians. The YPG and the Observatory had said a Turkish air strike on the town's main hospital killed 16 people the night before.

Russia is expected to expel British diplomats in retaliation for Prime Minister Theresa May's decision to kick out 23 Russians, as relations between the two countries crash to a post-Cold War low over an attack involving a military-grade nerve agent on English soil.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Friday Moscow had already decided on retaliatory measures, which she said Britain would be informed of in the near future.
After the first known offensive use of a nerve agent in Europe since World War Two, Britain has pointed the finger at President Vladimir Putin and on Thursday May gave the 23 Russians - who she said were spies working under diplomatic cover at the embassy in London - a week to leave.
Moscow has denied any involvement in the attempted murder of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter. It has cast Britain as a post-colonial power unsettled by its impending exit from the European Union, and even suggested London fabricated the attack to whip up anti-Russian hysteria.

Asked by a Reuters reporter in the Kazakh capital if Moscow would expel British diplomats, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov smiled and said on Friday: ""We will, of course.""

The forensics institute at Hospital Kuala Lumpur came under the global spotlight last year when it conducted the post mortem on the body of Kim Jong Nam, the murdered half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Hospital authorities said fire fighters had put out the blaze and no casualties had been reported.
Images and videos posted on Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) showed hospital staff evacuating dozens of patients on stretchers and in wheelchairs. 
""The cause of the fire and extent of damage are still being investigated and further information will be announced from time to time,"" said HKL director Dr Nor Akma binti Yusuf.
Last year, a blaze at an Islamic boarding school in Kuala Lumpur killed at least 23 people, most of them teenage boys.
The fire at HKL is believed to have started at the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, the top forensics agency in the country, Nor said.
The forensics institute has handled several high profile cases in Malaysia, including the post mortem on the body of Kim Jong Nam.
Two women, Indonesian Siti Aisyah and Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong, have been charged with murdering Kim by smearing his face with VX, a banned chemical poison, at Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13 last year.
Any connection between the fire and this case was considered unlikely.

""In case some European countries are following steps to put non-nuclear sanctions against Iran in order to please the American president, they will be making a big mistake and they will see the direct result of that on the nuclear deal,” Abbas Araqchi said, according to state media.
“It’s better that European countries continue their current action to persuade America to keep its promises in the nuclear deal and for that country to effectively execute the deal in all its parts with good will and in a productive atmosphere.”
Araqchi's comments were in reaction to a Reuters report that Britain, France and Germany have proposed fresh EU sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missiles and its role in Syria’s war to try to persuade Washington to preserve the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran.
Iran agreed to curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of a number of sanctions as part of the deal. Senior Iranian officials have repeatedly said their missile program is not up for negotiation.
The proposal is part of an EU strategy to save the accord signed by world powers that curbs Tehran’s ability to develop nuclear weapons, namely by showing U.S. President Donald Trump that there are other ways to counter Iranian power abroad.
Trump delivered an ultimatum to the European signatories on Jan. 12. It said they must agree to “fix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear deal” - which was sealed under his predecessor Barack Obama - or he would refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief on Iran. U.S. sanctions will resume unless Trump issues fresh “waivers” to suspend them on May 12.
If America pulls out of the agreement then the nuclear deal will be finished, Araqchi said, according to a report published by the Mehr News agency on Saturday.

“If America exits the deal and unilateral sanctions return, we will definitely not continue the deal because it will not serve our interests,” Araqchi was quoted as saying.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia signed an agreement on Saturday with Southeast Asian nations including Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines promising to share intelligence to combat terrorism.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced the signing of the memorandum of understanding in which Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) agreed to share intelligence, co-operate on lawmaking and counter extremism on social media.
Australia is hosting ASEAN meetings this weekend, despite not being a member of the 10-nation bloc, as it seeks to tighten political and trade ties in the region amid China's rising influence.
Turnbull said in a televised address to ASEAN that Islamic State's influence was growing in Southeast Asia after the militants had lost their caliphate in the Middle East.
""They'll return battle-hardened and trained, so it's vital for Australia and our ASEAN partners to collaborate across borders,"" he said.
Turnbull said non-conventional tools such as digital currencies, stored value cards and crowd-funding platforms were making it harder to detect terror financing.
""As regional partners, we all play a crucial role in combating these disturbing and dangerous phenomena,"" he said.
Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said the government would introduce a new law to crack encryption online.
The new law would force companies providing communications services and devices in Australia to help agencies in investigations, he said in a press release.
Malaysian President Najib Razak said Islamic State's online propaganda could reach more than 300 million Muslims in Southeast Asia.
""What is also very important is promoting a culture in which radical ideologies find it hard to take root,"" he said.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - China and Cambodia on Saturday kicked off military exercises focused on counter-terrorism and rescue operations, highlighting the strong ties between the two countries amid strained relations between Cambodia and the United States.
Major General Zhang Jian, commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Southern Theatre Command, and Pol Saroeun, commander-in-chief of the Cambodian military, opened the Dragon Gold 2018 exercise west of Cambodia’s capital, Phnom Penh.
Pol Saroeun said the exercise, which involves 280 Cambodian and 216 Chinese soldiers, aims to celebrate the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties and strengthen the ""traditional relationship and trust politically between the two countries"".
China is Cambodia's largest foreign investor and has poured billions of dollars into infrastructure projects in the country.
Pol Saroeun said Cambodia has benefited from China which tops foreign investments and foreign tourist arrivals in the country.
""The support in spirit, equipment and finance from the great friend China in great numbers have made Cambodia progress rapidly,"" he said. 
China held its first joint naval drill with Cambodia in 2016 and Phnom Penh suspended joint military exercises with the United States indefinitely a year later saying it was too busy holding elections.
The exercise comes ahead of a July general election that Prime Minister Hun Sen, with backing from China, looks set to win easily after the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was dissolved by the Supreme Court last November at his government's request.
The opposition ban prompted the United States, the European Union and others to condemn a crackdown by Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) on critics, including opposition lawmakers and some independent media.
Hun Sen has accused the United States of supporting the CNRP of staging a ""color revolution"" to overthrow his government.
Washington has dismissed accusations of American backing for an alleged plot by the opposition leader Kem Sokha, who faces treason charges he says were intended to stop him contesting the election.
Hun Sen often reminds Cambodians about devastating U.S. bombing that began in the late 1960s and a coup by a U.S.-backed general in 1970. Shortly afterwards, U.S. troops invaded from Vietnam and war engulfed the country, leading to the takeover by the genocidal Khmer Rouge in 1975.

Public opinion toward the United States in generally favorable, however. A 2016 survey showed that 85 percent of Cambodians had a positive view of the U.S. impact on the region.

Alvarado Munoz, a 43-year-old religious singer and former journalist who belongs to the National Restoration Party, shot to prominence after condemning a court ruling that urged Costa Rica to grant civil marriage rights to same-sex couples.
The survey by polling firm OPol Consultores conducted from March 12-16 gave Alvarado Munoz 56.9 percent effective support ahead of a second round run-off on April 1, once undecided voters and those planning to skip the vote were stripped out.
That left his younger rival Alvarado Quesada, a former minister in the center-left Citizens' Action Party of President Luis Guillermo Solis, on 43.1 percent. Alvarado Quesada is a supporter of gay marriage.
Over one third of the electorate was undecided or planned not to vote, the poll for online newspaper El Mundo showed.
If those Costa Ricans were factored in, Alvarado Munoz had the backing of 36.5 percent of voters, and Alvarado Quesada 27.7 percent support, the polling firm said.
The poll had a margin of error of 1.7 percentage points, and was based on interviews with 3,300 people nationwide.
Surveys by OPol have shown a clearer advantage in the race for Alvarado Munoz than others. A University of Costa Rica poll published on March 6 gave Alvarado Quesada a slight lead.
Alvarado Munoz was elected to the national assembly in 2014 as the only federal deputy representing the Christian-backed National Restoration Party.
His rise on a ticket opposing gay marriage was helped by the decline of a two-party system going back decades in a country that has long been considered one of Latin America's most stable.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will send helicopters and support troops, including medical staff, to join a United Nations peace-keeping mission in Mali later this year, a senior Canadian government source said late on Friday.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government will announce on Monday that Canada plans to send troops and aircraft to Mali for up to 12 months, said the official, who declined to provide further details. 
The plan was earlier reported by Canadian broadcaster CBC. 
Trudeau promised in 2016 to send up to 600 troops to U.N. peace-keeping operations in Mali, where soldiers under the U.N. are fighting Islamist militants. More than 80 people deployed through the U.N. have been killed in Mali since 2013, making it the world's deadliest peace-keeping operation.
The Canadian government in November said it would hold off on announcing deployment of troops to Mali as it reviewed strategy for participating in U.N. peace-keeping missions. 
It said it would offer transport aircraft and helicopters in a series of ""smart pledge"" initiatives, splitting soldiers among various missions with no more than 200 going to any spot and helping to train peace keepers.

Government insiders told Reuters in November that enthusiasm for the Mali mission faded as the extent of likely casualties and the complex nature of the conflict became clear.

999,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2018 12:52AM ET</span>",Former FBI No.2 McCabe fired; claims he is being targeted,"By Sarah N. Lynch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired the FBI's former No.2 official Andrew McCabe Friday, prompting McCabe to say he is being targeted because he is a crucial witness into whether President Donald Trump tried to obstruct the Russia investigation.
Sessions, in a statement on Friday, said he felt justified in firing McCabe after the Justice Department's internal watchdog found he leaked information to reporters and misled investigators about his actions.
""The FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity and accountability,"" Sessions said.
But McCabe, who played a crucial role in the bureau's investigations of Hillary Clinton and Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. election, denied those claims and said he is facing retaliation by the Trump administration.
In a lengthy statement, McCabe said he believes he is being politically targeted because he corroborated former FBI Director James Comey's claims that Trump tried to pressure him into killing the Russia probe.
Trump ousted Comey last year and acknowledged in a televised interview that he fired Comey over ""this Russia thing."" 
McCabe's dismissal came two days before his 50th birthday, when he would have been eligible to retire from the Federal Bureau of Investigation with his full pension. The firing - which comes nine months after Trump fired Comey - puts McCabe's pension in jeopardy.
It also is likely to raise questions about whether McCabe received an overly harsh punishment due to political pressure by the Republican president, who has blasted McCabe on Twitter and called for his ouster.
Comey's firing paved the way for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to tap Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is now leading the investigation into possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump has denied there was any collusion.
""I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey,"" McCabe said in his statement.
""This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort ... to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally.""
Trump posted a message on his twitter account early Saturday, praising the action and blasting both McCabe and Comey.
Trump wrote, ""Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!""
McCabe had stepped down from his position as FBI deputy director in January but remained on leave pending retirement.
His departure was triggered by a critical report from the Justice Department's inspector general that eventually led the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility to recommend he be fired. 
The report, which has yet to be made public, says McCabe misled investigators about his communications with a former Wall Street Journal reporter who was writing about McCabe's role in probes tied to Clinton, including an investigation of the Clinton family's charitable foundation.
In his statement, McCabe denied ever misleading investigators. 
He added that the release of the inspector general's report was ""accelerated"" after he testified behind closed doors before the U.S. House Intelligence Committee where he revealed he could back up Comey's claims.
Comey's firing has become central to questions about whether Trump unlawfully sought to obstruct the Russia investigation. 
McCabe could potentially be a crucial witness in Mueller's investigation.
Trump and other Republicans have accused McCabe, a lifelong Republican who worked at the FBI for more than 20 years, of political bias and conflicts in connection with his oversight of investigations related to Clinton.
Some of that criticism stemmed from the fact that his wife, Jill McCabe, a Democrat, received donations for her unsuccessful 2015 Virginia state Senate campaign from Terry McAuliffe, who was then the state's governor and an ally of the Clintons.
McCabe did not start overseeing the investigations until after his wife's campaign ended, the FBI has said, and therefore did not have a conflict of interest.
On Twitter last year, Trump questioned why McCabe was allowed to oversee an investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server while his wife received donations from ""Clinton puppets."" He said McCabe was ""racing the clock to retire with full benefits.""
Behind closed doors, Trump also asked McCabe who he voted for in the presidential election and referred to his wife as a loser, according to a source familiar with the matter.
McCabe initially did not respond to Trump's question but later told Trump he did not vote in 2016, the source said.
Asked about this in January, Trump said he did not recall asking McCabe whom he voted for.
The inspector general's report is largely focused on how McCabe answered questions about whether he leaked to the press in advance of a story that was critical of his oversight into the Clinton foundation investigation.
McCabe contends he did not view this as a leak but as an authorized disclosure that is commonplace in Washington between reporters and government officials. 

He said he answered questions truthfully, and later, when he felt investigators misunderstood his answers, he tried to clarify his responses with them.

The leftist, who is running for president for the third time, promises to end corruption and fight inequality without disrupting the economy. Critics fear he will put the brakes on economic reforms brought in by President Enrique Pena Nieto.
A former Mexico City mayor, Lopez Obrador has a wide lead in most opinion polls.
""Every two years there will be a popular consultation to ask if you want me to remain in the presidency or if I should resign,"" Lopez Obrador said, in a brief speech after formally registering his candidacy with electoral authorities.
Mexican presidents are permitted only one term of six years, and the 64-year-old Lopez Obrador said last week he would not be seeking to change the law to allow him to run again.
Lopez Obrador cited famous Mexican presidents Benito Juarez, Francisco I. Madero and Lazaro Cardenas, saying he wanted to be remembered as one of the country's best leaders. 
""I'm conscious of my historic responsibility,"" he told supporters. ""I won't fail the people, I won't betray the country.""
Lopez Obrador did not give more details of how the ""popular consultations"" would be carried out. Mexico's constitution does not mention recall referendums.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Saudi, Emirati and Qatari leaders will beat a path to U.S. President Donald Trump's door in the next few weeks for back-to-back visits that are unlikely to solve a long-running dispute among America's Gulf allies.
Washington is keen to end the standoff between Qatar on one side and several other Arab nations on the other. The rift has divided the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) group of nations and hurt U.S.-led efforts to maintain a strong front against Iran.
The United States was hoping to host a U.S.-GCC summit later this year but the prospects of that happening appear slim given that the rival leaders are still at odds. 
""They don't see eye to eye. They're not ready to solve this crisis,"" a senior administration official said, referring to the parties embroiled in the Gulf crisis. 
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut off travel and trade ties with Qatar last June, accusing it of backing their arch-rival Iran and supporting terrorism. Qatar denies the charges and says the boycott is an attempt to impinge on its sovereignty and rein in its support for reform.
Washington has strong alliances with the rival sides. Qatar hosts the largest U.S. air base in the region which has been crucial to its anti-Islamic State military campaign in Syria and Iraq. 
At the same time, the Trump administration has forged even closer ties with Qatar's rivals, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. 
WASHINGTON MEETINGS
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will meet with Trump on Tuesday in Washington and the Qatar dispute is unlikely to be at the forefront of issues the young leader will want to discuss, diplomats say.
Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani then meets Trump on April 10 in the White House.
And, keen to have the last word with Trump, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed has sought to meet Trump after a scheduled meeting with the Qatari emir, the senior administration official said.
Originally, the crown prince, sometimes known in the West as MbZ, was due to meet with Trump on March 27.
""MbZ in fact had asked Trump to be last,"" the senior administration official said. No new dates have yet been set.
The leaders are likely to talk to Trump about countering Iran, combating Islamist extremism, and deepening economic and military partnerships.
""There appears to be little to gain -- and a bit to lose -- in Gulf partners agreeing to another US-GCC Summit of leaders hosted by President Trump at Camp David,"" said a former senior U.S. official who worked on regional issues. 
""They have more to gain prosecuting their independent agendas in the bilateral visits to Washington already scheduled,"" the former official said. 
The Arab countries' boycott disrupted Qatar's imports and triggered the withdrawal of billions of dollars from Qatari banks by depositors from the four states.
Qatar, the world's top exporter of liquefied natural gas, developed new trade routes and deployed tens of billions of dollars from its massive sovereign wealth fund to protect its banks. 
The UAE in particular bristles at alleged Qatari support for Islamists throughout the region.
The Trump administration is worried that the split among Sunni Muslim U.S. allies can benefit Iran in the tussle for influence in the Middle East. 
So far, neither Saudi Arabia nor the UAE feel their demands have been met to resolve the dispute. At the start of the crisis, the four countries sent Doha a list of 13 demands, including closing the state-funded Al Jazeera television station and reducing ties to Iran.
While Qatar has increased its lobbying efforts in Washington, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi see the dispute as a ""minor irritant"" and ""not an urgent problem, it's one that they can live with for a very long time, that it's not affecting U.S. interests,"" said Rob Malley, head of the International Crisis Group think tank.
""They want to treat it as part of the furniture and not as something that requires immediate attention,"" said Malley, who has met recently with Saudi officials. 
An apparently contradictory approach from the White House is also complicating U.S. efforts to mediate in the dispute.
Trump at first swung decisively behind the Saudis and Emiratis, calling Qatar ""a funder for terrorism"". But under pressure from outgoing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, he has since moderated his stance, calling for Gulf unity. 
Qatar had grown more confident in support from Washington, which recently hosted joint high-level talks.
A senior U.S. official with knowledge of the U.S. mediation effort said there was still some willingness among the Gulf allies to begin a dialogue.
""They’re beginning to realize that this only plays into the hands of the Iranians, Syrians and Russians and it’s time to figure out how to resolve these issues,"" the official said.

""Intellectually they know this has to be resolved, and it will only get worse and affect things...viscerally they would love to continue it in some way because the feelings are so strong,"" the official said.

1003,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 09:49PM ET</span>","Trump signs U.S.-Taiwan travel bill, angering China","By David Brunnstrom
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday signed legislation that encourages the United States to send senior officials to Taiwan to meet Taiwanese counterparts and vice versa, angering China, which views the self-ruled island as a wayward province.
The bill, which is non-binding, would have gone into effect on Saturday morning, even if Trump had not signed it, said the White House.
The move adds to strains between the two countries over trade, as Trump has enacted tariffs and called for China to reduce its huge trade imbalance with the United States, even while Washington has leaned on Beijing to help resolve tensions with North Korea.
Earlier on Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang reiterated that Beijing was opposed to the legislation and urged the United States to abide by the ""one China"" policy, that stipulates that Taiwan is part of China, and cease official exchanges with Taiwan.
In a statement after Trump's signing of the bill, the Chinese embassy said clauses of the legislation ""severely violate the one-China principle, the political foundation of the China-U.S. relationship"".
""China is strongly dissatisfied with that and firmly opposes it,"" the statement said, adding that the United States should ""stop pursuing any official ties with Taiwan or improving its current relations with Taiwan in any substantive way.""
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry expressed its thanks for the ""friendly move"" by the Trump administration, saying the government would continue to deepen its cooperation and partnership with the United States at all levels.
The United States does not have formal ties with Taiwan but is required by law to help it with self-defense and is the island's primary source of weapons. 
Douglas Paal, who served as U.S. representative to Taiwan from 2002 to 2006, said the legislation did not change anything real as it was non-binding. U.S. administrations already had discretionary authority to permit visits by senior Taiwanese officials and visits by senior U.S. officials and military officers to Taiwan, he said.
""They don't authorize these trips because the policy judgment is that the costs in relations with China would outweigh the benefits in relations with Taiwan,"" Paal said.
The bill, which was passed by Congress last month, says it should be U.S. policy to allow visits at all levels. High-level Taiwan officials should be permitted to enter the United States ""under respectful conditions"" to meet U.S. officials, while Taiwanese economic and cultural representatives should be encouraged to conduct business in the United States.
China's hostility toward Taiwan has risen since the election of President Tsai Ing-wen, of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, in 2016.
It suspects Tsai wants to push for formal independence, which would cross a red line for Communist Party leaders in Beijing, although Tsai has said she wants to maintain the status quo and is committed to ensuring peace.

Defeated Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Chinese civil war to the Communists.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's top federal prosecutor said on Friday she would not hesitate to demand federal authorities take control of an investigation of the murder of a Rio de Janeiro city councilwoman if it appears local police were not aggressively pursuing the case.
Prosecutor General Raquel Dodge told reporters she hoped it would not be necessary for her to petition Brazil's top appeals court to give federal police and prosecutors control over the investigation of the assassination of Marielle Franco, 38, a rising star in the Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL).
Dodge has already taken the initial bureaucratic steps required to monitor the work of Rio de Janeiro state investigators' efforts to find those responsible for the Wednesday night killing of Franco. 
The councilwoman was shot four times in the head as she rode in the back of a car after attending a women's empowerment event in Rio. Her driver was also killed, while a press secretary in the car suffered cuts but was not seriously hurt. 
The federal government decreed a month ago that Brazil's army would take over all security operations through the end of the year in Rio, where murders have risen sharply. 
Franco, part of a commission overseeing the military intervention, harshly criticized the move on Sunday, saying it could worsen police violence against residents. 
She also repeatedly criticized Rio's police for the repeated killings of innocents in the city's numerous shanty-towns who are often caught in the crossfire as drug gangs and officers engage in firefights in highly populated areas. 
Federal police on Friday were investigating the origin of the 9 mm ammunition used in Franco's killing. 
A source with direct knowledge of the investigation told Reuters that the ammunition was originally part of a large lot purchased by the federal police in 2006. 

The ammunition was apparently stolen and has been used in more than 50 crimes since, the source said on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the matter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has not yet seen Pakistan take significant steps to clamp down on the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network militant groups, a senior U.S. administration official said on Friday.
The administration suspended about $2 billion in security assistance to Pakistan in January but Islamabad has failed to take ""the kind of decisive and irreversible action"" Washington has asked for to help with the war in Afghanistan, the official told reporters.
The administration has been frustrated by what it sees as Pakistan's reluctance to act against the Afghan Taliban and the affiliated Haqqani network. Washington believes the groups use Pakistan as a safe haven for launching attacks on neighboring Afghanistan. Pakistan denies helping the militants.
The United States has been at war in Afghanistan since 2001, making it America's longest military conflict. President Donald Trump agreed in August to a stepped-up military campaign against the Taliban, and has since increased pressure on Pakistan to help.
U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Tuesday said he has seen some positive signs from Islamabad, including Pakistani military operations along the border - and the senior administration official agreed.
""I think the Pakistanis have wanted to appear responsive to our requests,"" the senior administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""What I would say is, they have done the bare minimum to appear responsive to our requests,"" the official said, saying more proactive steps were needed.
U.S. officials have told their Pakistani counterparts what types of actions are needed to lift the suspension of aid, the official said, declining to elaborate on the specifics.
""We are prepared to take steps that we think are necessary to safeguard U.S. personnel and interests in the region,"" the official said, declining comment on what those steps would be, and on deadlines for action.
""We are continuing to look for real action, not just words, from Pakistan on the Taliban and Haqqani sanctuaries,"" the official said.

On Thursday, 35-year-old Sengal street vendor Mame Mbaye Ndiaye suffered a heart attack in the street while walking away from police. That evening protesters threw stones and set dustbins alight in Madrid's Lavapies neighborhood, home to many migrant communities and near to where Ndiaye died.
Friday's gathering in a square in Lavapies passed without violence. Protesters held signs reading slogans such as ""Enough of police harassment"" and chanted ""Police murderers"".
Madrid's Mayor Manuela Carmena has said the council would investigate the incident. At a news conference on Friday, a spokeswoman for the council said municipal police did not chase Mbaye as reported by some of the protesters.
A police van was flagged down by Mbaye's companion and two officers tried to revive him while calling an ambulance but he died, the town hall said in a statement.
Twenty people were injured during clashes with police on Thursday evening, the town hall said.

Illegal street sellers, many of them African migrants, are a common sight in Madrid and other Spanish cities. Hawking anything from watches to handbags, they often lay out their wares on blankets which can be quickly gathered up and stowed away to avoid police scrutiny.

SAN CRISTOBAL, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuela imposed electricity rationing this week in six western states, as the crisis-hit country's creaky power grid suffered from a drought that has reduced water levels in key reservoirs needed to run hydroelectric power generators.
The four-hour formal outages began on Thursday. But many residents scoffed at the announcement, wryly noting that they have been suffering far more extended blackouts during the last week. 
""We have spent 14 hours without electricity today. And yesterday electricity came and went: for six hours we had no power,"" said Ligthia Marrero, 50, in the western state of San Cristobal, noting that her fridge had been damaged by the frequent interruptions. 
Crumbling infrastructure and lack of investments have hit Venezuela's power supply for years. Now, the situation has been exacerbated by dwindling rains. 
In the worst-hit western cities, business has all but ground to a halt at a time when the OPEC nation of 30 million is already suffering hyperinflation and a profound recession. Many Venezuelans are unable to eat properly on salaries of just a couple of dollars per month at the black market rate, sparking malnutrition, emigration and frequent sights of Venezuelans digging through trash or begging in front of supermarkets. 
Maybelin Mendoza, a cashier at a bakery in Tachira state, said business has been further hit because points of sale stop working during blackouts - just as Venezuelans are chronically short of cash due to hyperinflation. 
In the most dramatic cases, the opposition governor of Tachira state said three people, including a four-month-old, died this week because they failed to receive assistance during a power outage.
""Because of electrical failures, the machines weren't able to revive the people and they died,"" said Laidy Gomez. 
Reuters was unable to confirm the report. 
Authorities have acknowledged that interruptions will continue for at least two weeks, but they have not said whether they will spread to other states.
""Of a possible 1,100 megawatts, we are only generating 150 right now,"" Energy Minister Luis Motta told reporters referring to the Fabricio Ojeda dam, in the western Andean state of Merida.
Capital city Caracas and other major cities have not been hit by rationing yet. Two years ago, rationing there lasted five months when a drought hit the Guri dam, the country's largest hydroelectric dam.

But because of the economic crisis, Venezuela has reduced electricity consumption to about 14,000 megawatts at peak hours, according to engineer and former electricity executive Miguel Lara. Two years ago, state-run Corpoelec put the figure at 16,000 megawatts.

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 03:01PM ET</span>",Italy's 5-Star to shelve deficit-raising plans to calm markets: source,"By Giuseppe Fonte and Gavin Jones
ROME (Reuters) - The 5-Star Movement, which emerged as Italy's biggest party after this month's election, is preparing an economic plan which will not raise the fiscal deficit forecasts of the outgoing centre-left government, a 5-Star party source told Reuters.
The plan, to be presented in April, may surprise many supporters of the anti-establishment party, which has always pledged to raise the budget deficit in order to fund welfare spending and tax cuts.
""We are not going to propose raising the deficit at this point,"" the source told Reuters, adding that the program would maintain the current goal of Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni's caretaker government to balance the budget in 2020.
""We know Italy is under scrutiny at the moment and we want markets to understand that we want to be responsible with public finances,"" added the source, who asked not to be named.
5-Star won 32 percent of the vote in the March 4 ballot, some 14 percentage points more than its nearest rival, but the election produced a hung parliament, so it needs to find allies to be able to form a government.
5-Star and the far-right League - the leading party in a conservative coalition that won most parliamentary seats - both say they have the right to govern.
They are each preparing policy proposals to be presented in April as alternatives to the outgoing government's multi-year economic plan, but whereas the League has maintained strong eurosceptic rhetoric, 5-Star has taken more moderate positions.
The plan it is preparing may be seen as an attempt to persuade the ruling centre-left Democratic Party (PD) to back a 5-Star government as a junior partner rather than to go into opposition as it has so far pledged to do.
The PD was the biggest loser in the election, taking less than 19 percent of the vote, but its support in parliament would be sufficient to give 5-Star a working majority.
5-Star deputy Laura Castelli told Reuters the party's plan would center on transport infrastructure and renewable energy, with a particular focus on the poor south of the country where 5-Star garnered most of its votes at the election.
The plan will also ensure that increases in sales tax penciled in by the outgoing government to take effect from 2019 would be canceled, Castelli said.
""We want to avoid worsening the demand crisis we have been stuck in for the last decade,"" she said.

Scrapping these planned tax hikes will cost state coffers some 31 billion euros ($38.08 billion) between 2019 and 2020. Castelli did not say how this shortfall would be made up.

1009,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",Brazil presidential contender Gomes would reverse privatizations,"By Pedro Fonseca and Rodrigo Viga Gaier
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The most likely leftist contender in Brazil's presidential race, Ciro Gomes, is warning investors to hold off buying state assets in the energy sector because he would expropriate them if he wins in October.
That includes rights to oil fields granted last year and a legislative push to dilute state control of Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, or Eletrobras, the country's largest power utility.
""What I want to say is: 'Don't buy. Wait a bit,'"" Gomes said in an interview on Thursday in which the former governor of Ceara state detailed plans to raise taxes on wealthy Brazilians, reduce the country's hefty public debt and change the Central Bank's sole focus on fighting inflation.
Gomes maintains that President Michel Temer is illegitimate because he took office in the controversial impeachment of leftist Dilma Rousseff, arguing that his policies should be revised by the next government elected by the Brazilian people.
Gomes will benefit the most if former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazil's most influential politician, is barred from running due to a corruption conviction.
A Datafolha poll in January showed that if Lula cannot run, Gomes would have 13 percent of voter intentions in a field led by far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro with 20 percent.
Gomes expects to at least double his standing if he becomes the standard bearer of the left and hopes to win the backing of Lula's Workers Party, which could provide his running mate, he said.
While he would roll back many of Temer's market-friendly policies, Gomes said he was no ""juvenile leftist.""
Oil companies that won concessions last year in Brazil's pre-salt offshore region, including Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc,  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM),  Statoil  (OL:STL) ASA and  Total  SA (PA:TOTF), would be compensated when the state revokes their contracts, Gomes said. 
Even though he would redirect public spending to boost the economy and reduce social inequality, Gomes vowed he would be fiscally responsible.
""I will pay the debt,"" he said, adding that it would take several governments to do that, but he would start the trend.
If elected, he plans to levy taxes on profits and dividends, while increasing inheritance taxes.

Gomes thinks his main rival will be center-right candidate Geraldo Alckmin, the governor of Sao Paulo. However, Gomes said he would relish the chance to face Bolsonaro, a pro-gun, anti-gay former army captain whom he called a ""right-wing scarecrow.""

1010,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 02:01PM ET</span>","Bosnian Serb leader calls for ""peaceful"" change of Balkan borders","SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Bosnian Serb nationalist leader Milorad Dodik suggested on Friday that Bosnia's Serb region and a Serb-dominated part of Kosovo should merge with Serbia, defying the stance of international peace sponsors against any border changes.
Dodik, president of post-war Bosnia's autonomous Serb Republic, has long called for secession from Bosnia and lately urged Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic to put the issue on the agenda when in talks with big power policymakers.
Dodik, also popular among nationalists in Serbia, has stepped up pressure on Vucic to back his secessionist bid. But Vucic, a former nationalist now seeking to meet conditions for Serbia to join the European Union, has repeatedly said he respects Bosnia's territorial integrity and sovereignty.
""We need to open talks,"" Dodik said in an interview for the Belgrade-based private Pink television. ""There does not have to be war, it can be resolved through political means.""
Separatist sentiment in the Serb Republic is raising concern among the Western overseers of Bosnia's 1990s peace deal about a relapse into turmoil in the Balkans.
The Bosnian Serbs' rejection of an independent, multi-ethnic Bosnia in 1992 triggered an avalanche of bloodshed in which Serbs and Croats carved out ethnically pure statelets with the backing of kin in neighboring Serbia and Croatia.
The war, in which about 100,000 people died, was ended by the 1995 Dayton peace agreement which divided the country into two highly autonomous regions, the Serb Republic and the Federation dominated by Croats and Muslim Bosniaks.
Dodik's SNSD party announced a referendum on the Serb Republic's independence in 2018 but has postponed it. Instead, Dodik will run for the Serb seat on Bosnia's three-way inter-ethnic presidency in the October general election.
He told Pink TV that in that capacity he would be better placed to protect the Serb Republic from any usurpation of its powers by Bosnia's central government in Sarajevo. 
""Most Serbs would vote to join Serbia if a referendum was organized today. This has been a taboo until now; we were not allowed to do anything,"" he added, citing what he called international pressure against such a referendum. 
Serbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic on a visit to Sarajevo said that Belgrade respected the integrity of Bosnia. 
""(This) is a guarantor of the Dayton peace treaty and (Serbia) will respect any agreement that is reached with a mutual consensus of its three ethnic groups,"" he told Reuters. 
European Union officials say that Bosnia, Kosovo and Serbia, which all aspire to join the bloc, must first settle territorial disputes dating to the 1990s wars that followed the collapse of then-federal Yugoslavia. 

Dodik also backed the creation of a third, Croat only-dominated region in Bosnia, an option increasingly advocated by Bosnian Croat nationalists and strongly opposed by Bosniaks - the biggest victims of the 1992-95 war - and Western powers.

1011,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2018 12:49AM ET</span>",Exclusive: European powers propose new Iran sanctions to meet Trump ultimatum,"By Robin Emmott and John Irish
BRUSSELS/PARIS (Reuters) - Britain, France and Germany have proposed fresh EU sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missiles and its role in Syria's war, according to a confidential document, in a bid to persuade Washington to preserve the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran.
The joint paper, seen by Reuters, was sent to European Union capitals on Friday, said two people familiar with the matter, to sound out support for such sanctions as they would need the support of all 28 EU member governments.
The proposal is part of an EU strategy to save the accord signed by world powers that curbs Tehran's ability to develop nuclear weapons, namely by showing U.S. President Donald Trump that there are other ways to counter Iranian power abroad.
Trump delivered an ultimatum to the European signatories on Jan. 12. It said they must agree to ""fix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear deal"" - which was sealed under his predecessor Barack Obama - or he would refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief on Iran. U.S. sanctions will resume unless Trump issues fresh ""waivers"" to suspend them on May 12.
""We will therefore be circulating in the coming days a list of persons and entities that we believe should be targeted in view of their publicly demonstrated roles,"" the document said, referring to Iranian ballistic missile tests and Tehran's role in backing Syria's government in the seven-year-old civil war.
The steps would go beyond what a U.S. State Department cable seen by Reuters last month outlined as a path to satisfy Trump: simply committing to improving the nuclear deal.
It also reflects frustration with Tehran. ""We're getting irritated. We've been talking to them for 18 months and have had no progress on these issues,"" a diplomat said. 
European Union foreign ministers will discuss the proposal at a closed-door meeting on Monday in Brussels, diplomats said.
Analysts say the nuclear agreement, touted at the time as a breakthrough reducing the risk of a devastating wider war in the Middle East, could collapse if Washington pulls out.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif struck a defiant note towards Washington on Friday.
""If the United States makes the mistake of pulling out of the JCPOA, it will definitely be a painful mistake for the Americans,"" Iranian state television quoted Zarif as saying. The JCPOA is the formal name of the nuclear deal.
Zarif did not refer to the possibility of new EU sanctions.
The commission overseeing the nuclear accord said on Friday in Vienna that Iran was meeting its obligations under the deal.
The joint document by Britain, France and Germany said they were engaged in ""intensive talks with the Trump administration to ""achieve a clear and lasting reaffirmation of U.S. support for the (nuclear) agreement beyond May 12"".
The proposal follows weeks of talks between the State Department and European powers as they try to mollify the Trump administration, which is split between those who want to tear up the agreement and those who wish to preserve it.
A U.S. State Department official declined to comment, adding, ""We don't want to get ahead of the EU's decision-making process ... There is broad agreement on the areas that need strengthening, but how that's done in each of the three areas is the subject of our negotiations."" 
A different U.S. official cited ""very good"" talks with London, Paris and Berlin this week in Vienna on the issue.
""PROLIFERATION"" OF IRANIAN MISSILES
The document referred to sanctions that would ""target militias and commanders"". It proposes building on the EU's existing sanctions list related to Syria, which includes travel bans and asset freezes on individuals, and a ban on doing business or financing public and private companies.
It was strident in its criticism of Iran's ballistic weapons, which Tehran says are for defensive purposes, saying there were ""transfers of Iranian missiles and missile technology"" to Syria and allies of Tehran, such as Houthi rebels in Yemen and Lebanon's Iran-backed Shi'ite Hezbollah.
""Such a proliferation of Iranian missile capabilities throughout the region is an additional and serious source of concern,"" the document said.
Still, the issue is highly sensitive because the 2015 pact between Iran and six major powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - lifted international sanctions that crippled Iran's oil-based economy.
While the EU retains some sanctions on Iranians over human rights abuses, it rescinded its economic and financial restrictions on Iran in 2016 and does not want to be seen to be reneging on the agreement.
Iran signed up to limits on its uranium enrichment activity, which it has repeatedly said is for peaceful power generation, not atomic bombs, but has refused to discuss its missiles. 
The Islamic Republic has dismissed Western assertions that its activities in the Middle East are destabilising and also rejected Trump's demands to renegotiate the nuclear accord. 
In the joint document, Britain, France and Germany set out questions and answers that seek to show that legally, the European powers would not be breaking the terms of the nuclear deal. It said they are ""entitled to adopt additional sanctions against Iran"" as long as they are not nuclear-related or were previously lifted under the nuclear agreement.
The European powers said new sanctions are justified because Iran ""did not commit further to stop undertaking ballistic missile destabilising activities"" under the nuclear agreement.

The nuclear deal's terms did not cover ballistic missile activity.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An Israeli official who has coordinated with the Gulf Arab state of Qatar on aid to the Palestinians credited it on Friday with trying to prevent the funds reaching Hamas, but accused it of still ""flirting"" with the Islamic militant group.
Under embargo by four U.S.-allied Arab powers, Qatar has publicized its low-key contacts with Israel in an apparent bid to find favor with Washington and weaken U.S. President Donald Trump's apparent sympathy for the boycott. The Qataris have also courted several American Jewish leaders deemed close to Israel.
Qatar says Israel's blessing for the some $800 million in civilian relief funds it has funneled to the war-ravaged Gaza Strip counters suspicions it backs Hamas, which has de facto control of the enclave but is shunned by Israel and the West.
""If we are helping Hamas, do you think the Israelis (would) allow us to go inside and come out?"" Qatari envoy Mohammed Al-Emadi told Reuters during a Feb. 22 visit to Jerusalem, where he said he had met Israel's regional cooperation minister.
Confirming that meeting on Friday, the minister, Tzachi Hanegbi, described it as part of a bid ""to expand our diplomatic horizon with Middle East states that, for practical and formal reasons, cannot have above-the-radar relations"" with Israel. 
The Qataris, he told Tel Aviv radio station 102 FM, ""are endeavoring hugely to ensure their aid does not end up as any Hamas force build-up"".
""We know this, we supervise this and we approve this, because they really are doing construction - the construction of neighborhoods.""
Asked whether Qatar might be using its contacts with Israel for ""public relations"", Hanegbi said: ""They are in distress, as most of the countries in the Arab world boycott them because they flirt too much with terrorism, with Hamas, with all kinds of episodes that border on subversion."" 
DIPLOMATIC OUTREACH
He did not elaborate on the allegations.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and commercial ties with Qatar in June, with vocal backing from Trump, accusing it of supporting militant groups such as Hamas, meddling in their internal affairs and backing the agenda of Shi'ite Iran, Saudi Arabia's main rival for influence across the Middle East.
Qatar denies the charges and says its diplomatic outreach in Washington aims to set the record straight.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last month chided American Jewish leaders who made private trips to Qatar in the name of advancing Israel's interests, such as a return of the bodies of two soldiers who were declared killed in a 2014 war in Gaza. 
He encouraged U.S. Jewish engagement with Gulf states such as the United Arab Emirates, in which Israel sees partners against Iran and Hamas, but added: ""I’m definitely not talking about Qatar.""
Netanyahu delivered his speech at a Jerusalem conference as Emadi held meetings with Israeli officials at a nearby hotel.
Hanegbi said he was surprised that the Qatari envoy had disclosed their talks: ""Usually there is an agreement that a meeting of this kind remains secret. But they (the Qataris) decided (to publicize it) and that's their prerogative."" 
Like other Gulf Arab states, Qatar does not have full relations with Israel. Envoys from both - as well as from the Arab countries boycotting Qatar - attended a conference hosted by the White House this week on Gaza's economic plight.
Trump's Middle East envoy, Jason Greenblatt, who has previously promoted Israeli-Qatari cooperation on Gaza, tweeted to the conference's participants: ""Thank you for putting all tensions aside to work w/ us.""
On Jan. 15, in remarks that suggested a warming of ties between the two countries, Trump thanked Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani for ""action to counter terrorism and extremism in all forms"" and called for Gulf Arab unity.
Qatar has said Hamas is regarded by Arabs as a Palestinian resistance movement fighting against Israeli occupation, but it denies providing any financial support to the Islamist group and says all its aid goes to help the Palestinian people.
Many Western countries classify Hamas as a terrorist group over its failure to renounce violence, recognize Israel’s right to exist and accept existing interim Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A quick agreement to return Rohingya refugees to Myanmar is looking less and less likely, the U.N. refugee chief said on Friday as he launched an almost $1 billion appeal to support the stateless Muslims in camps in Bangladesh for the rest of 2018.
The United Nations says 671,000 Rohingya fled from Myanmar's Rakhine state after militant attacks in August sparked a crackdown led by security forces, which a U.N. investigator said bore ""the hallmarks of genocide"".
Filippo Grandi, head of the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, said the Rohingya must be allowed to return to their homes in Myanmar, but returns could only take place voluntarily and if their rights were guaranteed. 
“The odds are growing against a solution, an early solution anyway, but this is not a reason for me as High Commissioner for Refugees to give up on this issue,” he told a news conference.
""We are very mindful of the fact that this situation may take a long time, and therefore we need to plan for this.""
Asked how long the Rohingya might stay in their camps in Bangladesh at the minimum, Grandi said: “I wish I knew.”
Last year he had visited another part of Myanmar where displaced people had been stuck in camps for six or seven years. He said the Rohingya could not be subjected to the same fate on a much larger scale.
Myint Thu, permanent secretary at Myanmar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said on Wednesday that a first batch of 374 refugees could be repatriated. 
He also said Myanmar now considered it was appropriate to invite UNHCR and the U.N. Development Programme into the repatriation process. 
Grandi said he still did not have agreement for UNHCR's involvement, which he said was ""crucial, essential and indispensable"". 
""The discussions with Myanmar have been pretty basic, not very frequent, not very advanced, but they have continued. This is the way it goes in this situation. It’s very difficult,” Grandi said. 
The government does not recognize the Rohingya as citizens, and Grandi said their rights needed to be established, including citizenship, freedom of movement and access to services.
But first of all the violence had to stop. Although movements into Bangladesh have decreased massively since the flood late last year, they continue to come in smaller numbers, suggesting the situation has still not stabilized, he said. 

He also said that other governments should only invest in development projects in Rakhine if they ensured it supported the presence of Rohingyas and did not perpetuate the situation.

Falcon, an ex-state governor and former ally of Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chavez, defied an opposition boycott of the presidential election to run despite conditions critics say are rigged to ensure the ruling socialists retain control.
""We all knew that Henri Falcon would be an instrument of the Venezuelan government to divide the opposition - and his candidacy ends up proving it,"" Luis Almagro, the secretary general of the 34-member OAS, told an event in Madrid.
""Henri Falcon's candidacy benefits 'chavismo' (the ruling movement). We asked the Venezuelan opposition to sort the wheat from the chaff and Henri Falcon is the chaff that has separated alone,"" he added in comments to Reuters at the Casa de America cultural center.
Almagro reiterated his calls for harsher sanctions against Venezuela's ""dictatorship"". He said last month sanctions should be targeted against Venezuela's all-important oil sector to intensify financial pressure on Maduro's government, which has presided over five years of crippling recession.
Venezuela's main opposition coalition has rebuked Falcon for legitimizing an election they deem a farce, as Maduro's most popular rivals are barred from standing and the election board favors the government.
Maduro denies the system is undemocratic and calls the OAS a pawn of U.S. policy.
Falcon broke with the socialists in 2010 and is now promising a ""national unity"" government. While most analysts give him little chance, some recent polls actually put him ahead of Maduro in voter preferences.

Falcon has said the opposition's boycott is ineffective and will only give Maduro an uncontested win, arguing that 80 percent of Venezuelans wanted change.

BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Thousands of Slovaks will attend a third nationwide protest in as many weeks on Friday to repeat their call for early elections after Prime Minister Robert Fico's resignation failed to quell public anger over high-level corruption. 
Fico's government has been in crisis since the murder three weeks ago of 27-year-old investigative journalist Jan Kuciak who reported on fraud allegations against businessmen with political ties. The identity of his killers remains unknown. 
Kuciak's death provoked Slovakia's biggest protests since the fall of communism in 1989, and some of the biggest to hit central Europe in the past year where people have marched against attacks on courts, corruption in politics and tightening rules for international universities.
On Thursday the long-serving Fico stepped aside, handing the government reins to a deputy after his leftist Smer party and its coalition partners agreed a change of prime minister to keep the government going. His interior minister resigned earlier this week.
But critics say Fico will continue to hold sway and few expected his resignation to appease the protesters, who are due to start gathering at 1600 GMT.
""Let's finish what our parents started in November '89,"" Slovak march organizers said on the event's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, which showed 23,000 planned to turn up. ""Let's stand up for a decent Slovakia and let's not give up!""
Fico has vowed to remain an active party leader. His close ally Pellegrini was expected to announce appointments next week.
""As Smer chairman, he will continue to tutor the new prime minister,"" Martin Slosiarik from the Focus polling agency said. 
Just before he was found shot dead along with his fiancée at his house outside of Bratislava, Kuciak had been looking into suspected mafia links of Italians with businesses in Slovakia.
In his final report published after his death, Kuciak said one of these Italians had once been a business partner of two Slovaks who later worked in Fico's office. Both have resigned but deny connections to the murder. The Italian businessman has denied any mafia connections.
More than 23,000 people said on Facebook they would still attend the rally in capital Bratislava, while thousands were expected to march in other towns.

1017,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 10:21AM ET</span>",Kremlin supporters pressure Russian election observers before vote,"By Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Police last month detained David Kankiya, an observer at Russia's forthcoming presidential election, yards from his home in southern Russia. Police said his car may have been used in a crime, according to Kankiya.
Hours later, Kankiya was charged with disobeying the police, something he denies, and jailed for five days by a court. Weeks later, his car tyres were slashed with a knife, he says, and on Tuesday, pro-Kremlin journalists ambushed him.
""I have information that you have insulted the Russian people,"" one of the journalists said, a video of the incident shows. 
Days before Sunday's election, which polls show incumbent Vladimir Putin is on track to win comfortably, Golos, a non-governmental organization that monitors Russian elections, says it is under unprecedented pressure.
Its problems are part of what Kremlin critics say is a wider campaign by authorities to hinder or silence dissenting voices. 
Opposition politician Boris Nemtsov was shot dead in 2015, while current opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been barred from running in Sunday's election over what he says is a trumped-up fraud conviction.
The Kremlin, which denies involvement in Nemtsov's murder, wants Putin's re-election to be viewed as legitimate and largely clean in the West so as not to further damage already poor relations. At home, wary of street protests, the Kremlin is keen that voters see it in the same way.
The Kremlin says complaints about a crackdown on dissent are hollow. Individual cases are a matter for the relevant authorities who it says are only trying to uphold the law. 
Equally, the Central Election Commission says it will do everything it can to ensure Sunday's vote is free of fraud and has turned to Golos for advice on how to do that. 
However, opposition leader Navalny, accused by Putin of being Washington's pick for president, has predicted the authorities will resort to widespread fraud to deliver a Putin landslide and has spoken of organizing post-election protests of the kind that roiled Russia after Putin's last election victory in 2012.
Golos says the authorities unfairly blamed it for those protests -- some of the biggest since the Soviet collapse -- because of its work publicizing what it said were serious election violations, something it plans to do again on Sunday.
Kankiya, a Golos coordinator in the Krasnodar Region, says that's why he was targeted.
""I was detained and charged on a false pretext,"" Kankiya, 28, told Reuters by phone. ""It's political pressure.""
A court in Krasnodar disagrees. It rejected his appeal against his arrest and jailing on Wednesday. Police say he was detained after he failed to produce identification during a routine check.
'FOREIGN AGENT'
Election fraud has been a problem in Russia since the 1991 Soviet collapse. 
Abuses have often been highlighted by Golos, whose observers spend election day at polling stations and flag suspected cases of fraud to the authorities. 
Founded in 2000, the year Putin won his first presidential term, Golos says its problems began when Putin returned to the presidency in 2012.
""After the 2012 election, their task was to destroy Golos,"" Grigory Melkonyants, the movement's co-chairman said in an interview in his Moscow office, referring to the authorities.
A month after the election, the tax inspectors came. And, in July that year, Putin approved a law that forced non-governmental organizations engaging in political activity to register with the justice ministry as ""foreign agents."" 
Golos lost one of its main donors in 2012 when Moscow accused the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)of trying to influence politics and forced it to leave. 
Soon, weighed down by the red tape that came with being designated a ""foreign agent"" and facing a funding squeeze, Golos was struggling to function. In July 2016, at the behest of the justice ministry, a court ordered Golos to close.
Today, Golos still operates after reconfiguring its structure in such a way that it is not classified as a legal entity. 
PRESSURE 
A shoe-string operation run out of a pokey Moscow office staffed by about nine volunteers, it says it relies on private donations from inside Russia.
It has coordinators in almost half of Russia's voting regions, about 6,000 volunteers, and dozens of experts who train people how to observe elections.
Melkonyants says the movement on Sunday plans to field thousands of observers, run a telephone hot line for complaints, and chronicle reports of electoral abuses on a nationwide violations map on its website. It will deliver its verdict on how clean the election was on Monday.
But as election day draws near, pressure on Golos is intensifying.
Its volunteers have complained of being systematically stopped for long periods when leaving or entering the country by border staff who tell them there's a note by their name that says they are linked to terrorism, Golos says.
REN TV, a Russian TV channel, on Monday broadcast what it billed as a special investigation into Golos and other groups. The program depicted Golos as a shadowy Western-funded group that worked to discredit Russia in the eyes of the world. 
Andrei Klimov, a senator who heads up a committee in the upper house of parliament to prevent interference in Russia's internal affairs, told the program such groups posed a threat.
""They (Golos and other groups) will try to trigger protest,"" said Klimov.
And on Thursday, Golos said the landlord of a hall in Moscow it had agreed to rent for a call center on election day had annulled the rental contract after being told by the police to back out of the contract or face problems.
Kankiya, the Golos coordinator in southern Russia, said he would continue his work regardless.

""We're the only election observation movement in Russia capable of operating on a large scale,"" said Kankiya. ""Many people don't like that.""

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine's plans to force activists and non-governmental organizations to declare detailed financial information are likely to have a chilling effect on civil society, two leading international rights bodies said on Friday.
Ukraine's lawmakers and civil servants must already declare their income and assets in an online database, under a law rolled out in 2016 to tackle corruption in state institutions.
Authorities say regulation is also required to promote transparency in the NGO sector and prevent the pursuit of vested interests through illicit financing. 
A law forcing NGOs and activists to file online wealth declarations, like officials, has drawn strong criticism and Kiev has proposed cancelling it. Instead authorities have drafted two laws setting out a different financial reporting rule for NGOs.
But the new drafts have also been criticized in a joint opinion published by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE/ODIHR) and the Venice Commission, a body which rules on rights and democracy disputes in Europe. Member states, which include Ukraine, are committed to respecting its decisions.
""The new financial reporting and disclosure regime, if introduced, would conflict with freedom of association, the right to respect for private life and the prohibition of discrimination,"" the joint opinion said.
The laws ""are likely to have a chilling effect on civil society in Ukraine and should be removed in their entirety or significantly narrowed down"".
The judgment is its latest in a series of rulings that laws proposed by Ukraine fall short of democratic norms.
It also said Ukraine must follow through on its decision to scrap the requirement for activists to file online wealth declarations. 
""It is crucial that Ukraine's plans to cancel the e-declaration requirements for anti-corruption activists, which likewise raise several serious human rights issues, are implemented as a matter of urgency,"" the joint opinion said.
The next filing deadline for online wealth declarations is April 1. On Thursday, senior presidential official Dmytro Shymkiv urged parliament to cancel the requirement for activists next week.
""The alternative would be the country's shame in the international community from April 1. This is sad and insulting,"" he said in a post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger said one of the two diplomats linked to the alleged plot to snatch the Swiss-based businessman - who was active in the Gulenist movement that Ankara blames for the coup bid - remains in office in Bern. It said the second diplomat had since returned to Turkey.
""We utterly deny the baseless allegations contained in an article regarding the attempted abduction of a Swiss business person ... that also point to our embassy and our personnel as a target,"" Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said.
Earlier on Friday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu lashed out at a journalist during a news conference in Kazakhstan for asking a question related to the matter.
In the wake of the Tages-Anzeiger report, Swiss prosecutors confirmed a criminal investigation into the alleged plot had been under way since March 2017.
The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) said it had asked the Swiss Foreign Ministry to clarify whether the suspects enjoyed diplomatic immunity now or at the time of the alleged crime. Waiving any immunity was necessary to carry out further investigations, it added.
The OAG said a year ago that it had begun a criminal inquiry into possible foreign spying on Switzerland's Turkish community.
Swiss intelligence got wind of the 2016 kidnapping plot while it was being hatched, Tages-Anzeiger reported, adding that the intended victim remains under police protection.
The Turkish government blames U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen for the failed military coup. Gulen has denied any role in it.

In the email, the executive split staff into a ""Top Five"" and ""Bottom Five"", commenting on how many pints of beer he would need to have sex with them.
Paul Martin, the departing creative strategist at The&Partnership agency, said he had intended to mock sexism. However, he acknowledged that the email, sent on International Women's Day last week and later published by newspapers such as the Daily Mail and The Times, had ""totally missed the mark"".
Emboldened by campaigns such as the #MeToo social media movement, many women are expressing anger at years of abusive treatment, pay that lags behind men and workplace cultures that make them feel uncomfortable or threatened.
Women have complained about colleagues' behavior in many North American and British institutions, companies and industries including Hollywood, the media, financial services and in parliament.
The&Partnership said it had apologized to staff and made clear that emails like Martin's are not tolerated. 
A spokeswoman said it actively invested in and promoted women at all levels. Its three London agencies are all run by women, its media network in North America is run by two women, and it has female managing directors and heads of department across the business, she said.
Martin said he had intended the email as a way to mock a common tradition in British advertising of sending such messages, but added that it had ""understandably offended and upset many people"". 
""I take full and sole responsibility for this and sincerely apologize for all offense this has caused,"" he said in a statement. ""The email was meant to be a stupid, ironic attempt to subvert and mock the sexist 'Top Five' emails that have been sent around agencies for many years but I have totally missed the mark and take full responsibility.""

LONDON (Reuters) - An Iraqi teenager, who had come to Britain as an asylum seeker, was found guilty on Friday of attempted murder after detonating a homemade bomb on a packed rush-hour London commuter train, injuring 30 people, prosecutors and police said.
Ahmed Hassan, 18, was found guilty of trying to murder the passengers on board an underground train heading to central London on Sept. 15 last year, prosecutors said.
The bomb went off at Parsons Green station and flames engulfed the carriage, but it did not fully explode, limiting the scale of injuries in what authorities said was Britain's fifth major attack of 2017.
""It was only a matter of luck that the device did not work as he intended or it could easily have led to the loss of innocent lives,"" said Sue Hemming from Britain's Crown Prosecution Service.
Hassan, who the court heard had spoken of his duty to hate Britain because of the deaths of his parents in Iraq, had been placed under Britain's counter-radicalisation program at the time.
""He was very cunning and devious,"" Dean Haydon, the head of London Police's Counter Terrorism Command told BBC TV. 
""On the face of it, Hassan was engaged on the program. But coming back to his devious nature, he kept it very secretive in relation to what he was doing, what he was planning, and nobody around him actually knew what his plot was.""
Haydon said a review of the counter-radicalisation program would now be undertaken.
On the day of the attack, the teenager left his foster home in Sunbury-on-Thames in west London and set the timer for the device, made with the highly volatile triacetone triperoxide (TATP) - known as ""the mother of Satan"", in toilets at Wimbledon station where he boarded a District Line underground train, police said.
SHRAPNEL
He got off at the stop before Parsons Green leaving behind his bomb which was placed in a bucket. It was packed with more than two kilograms of metal shrapnel including screws, bolts, nails, knives and screw drivers, the court heard.
There were 93 passengers in the carriage when it detonated. They reported hearing a loud bang and seeing a fireball with one woman suffering burns to her hands, legs, and face causing her to lose the hair on her eyebrows and eyelashes. Others were hurt in a stampede to flee the scene.
Hassan was arrested in the southern port of Dover the following day carrying 2,320 pounds in cash and a new phone. 
The court heard he arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry in 2015, claimed asylum and was placed with foster parents in Sunbury. He told British officials that he had been taken by force by Islamic State militants, who had threatened to kill his family members, and had given him military training. 
Britain said at the time there was no evidence to suggest IS was responsible for the Parsons Green attack despite the group's claims of responsibility.
Police and prosecutors said his motive was unclear. A teacher and a youth worker told the court Hassan had seemed confused and angry, and that he believed his father had been killed by U.S. bombing.
Hassan admitted to police he had made the bomb but said he had never intended to kill and merely wanted attention. He had pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder. 
He told the court that he had been attracted to the idea of being a fugitive, chased across Europe by the police and Interpol.

However, the jury at London's Old Bailey court convicted him of attempted murder and he will be sentenced at a later date.

HARARE (Reuters) - Four months after his overthrow, former Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe was back on familiar territory on Friday, splashed across the front pages after lambasting his successor as a ""disgrace"".
The 94-year-old's first media interview since his forced resignation in the wake of a November military takeover caused a stir on the streets of the capital. Groups of people milled round piles of newspapers stacked high on pavements. 
""People pretend that they don't like the old man but the moment he opens his mouth they all want to hear what he is saying. Look, the newspapers are almost sold out,"" said Kelvin Chijokoro, a street newspaper vendor. 
Mugabe's attacked the legitimacy of new President Emmerson Mnangagwa and told South African state broadcaster SABC he had never thought his former protege would turn against him. 
Mnangagwa, a former Mugabe security chief nicknamed 'The Crocodile', refused to get sucked into a slanging match, saying Mugabe was simply enjoying his constitutional right to free speech - a right routinely denied to Zimbabweans during Mugabe's 37 years in power.
""He is entitled to express himself freely, as is the case for any private citizen,"" Mnangagwa said in a statement.
Pointedly, the state-owned Herald newspaper, which has switched from being Mugabe's propaganda mouthpiece for the last three decades to Mnangagwa's, ignored the interview.
TWITTER VITRIOL
Mugabe, one of last 'Big Men' of African politics, had been the dominant political force in Zimbabwe since the country gained independence from Britain in 1980 and many citizens had come to believe he would die in office.
His comments were the main topic of conversation in a hair salon in downtown Harare on Friday.
""He should live with the reality that he is not in power anymore and Zimbabwe is better without a dictator like him,"" said hair stylist Rosemary Wakatama.

Mnangagwa has been feted by African leaders and the West. But many have said they will be watching elections in the next five months as the first major test of his rule.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - First there was ""Vatileaks"". Now there is ""Lettergate"".
For the past week, the Vatican has been enmeshed in a controversy that conservatives say has all the hallmarks of a cover-up but others say is probably the result of botched communications.
On Monday, the head of the Vatican communications department, Monsignor Dario Vigano, moderated a presentation of an 11-booklet series of musings by 11 commentators on ""The Theology of Pope Francis"".
Vigano read out a five-paragraph letter from retired Pope Benedict in which Francis' predecessor, now 90, rejected the ""stupid prejudice"" of those who say the Argentinian is destroying the Church with liberal theology..
Benedict also disputed suggestions by conservatives that Francis' academic qualities were lacking, praising his successor as a ""man of deep philosophical and theological formation"" and finding an ""interior continuity between the two pontificates"".
But a press release handed out to journalists at the event omitted the fourth paragraph of the letter, in which Benedict apologized for not having had the time to read all 11 volumes and thus declining a request to write a ""dense theological"" introduction for the series.
And in a publicity photo sent to media, showing the first page of Benedict's letter lying on a table, the start of the paragraph is illegible, apparently intentionally blurred to emphasize the rest of the letter, which is in focus.
Conservative critics of Francis saw the blurring and the selective press release as part of a plot to censor the thoughts of the former pope, who resigned in 2013.
Many conservative Catholics still look up to Benedict as a bulwark against liberals, and have lambasted Francis for being too lenient on divorced Catholics and homosexuals.
""Increasing numbers of faithful Catholics are becoming alarmed and increasingly by what they see as a continual stream of deceptions, manipulations and scandals coming from the Vatican under Pope Francis,"" said Edward Pentin, an ultra-conservative author who writes about the Vatican for the U.S. newspaper National Catholic Register.
In an email to Reuters, he dubbed the whole episode the Vatican's ""Lettergate"".
However, a video of the event confirms that Vigano did read out the entire letter, including the paragraph omitted in the press release. 
""Speaking of a plot makes no sense,"" said Angela Ambrogetti, head of the Catholic news agency Acistampa and a conservative herself. ""The whole letter was read and the last paragraph in no way changes the significance of Benedict's previous comments.""
Vigano had no comment. 

The episode evoked the ""Vatileaks"" scandal of 2012, when Pope Benedict's personal butler stole some of the pontiff's personal letters and leaked them to the media.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Thousands of civilians were fleeing from besieged enclaves at opposite ends of Syria on Friday as two major battles in the multi-sided war entered decisive phases, with hundreds of thousands of people trapped in the path of both assaults. 
Air strikes killed scores of people in eastern Ghouta, a war monitor said, and weary residents streamed out on foot for a second day, as Russian-backed government forces pressed their campaign to capture the last big rebel bastion near Damascus. 
On another front, Turkish and allied rebel forces struck the northern Kurdish-held town of Afrin, killing more than 40 people including children, Syrian Kurdish forces and a monitor said. 
The Kurdish YPG militia defending Afrin said it battled Turkish forces who tried to storm the town from the north. 
The two offensives, one backed by Russia and the other led by Turkey, have shown how Syrian factions and their foreign allies are aggressively reshaping the map of control after the defeat of Islamic State's self-proclaimed caliphate last year.
The Syrian war entered its eighth year this week having killed half a million people and driven more than 11 million from their homes, including nearly 6 million who have fled abroad in one of the worst refugee crises of modern times.
The government launched its offensive on eastern Ghouta a month ago, and Turkey began its cross-border assault in Afrin in January. In both cases, hundreds of thousands of civilians have been trapped inside encircled pockets on the battlefield.
An estimated 12,000-16,000 people left Ghouta in recent days, while fighting in the Afrin region has reportedly displaced more than 48,000, said Linda Tom, a U.N. humanitarian spokeswoman in Syria.
AIR STRIKES KILL 80, CIVILIANS FLEE
Backed by Russia and Iran, government forces have thrust deep into eastern Ghouta on the capital's outskirts, splintering the rebel enclave into three separate zones. The United Nations believes up to 400,000 people have been trapped in the Ghouta satellite towns and farmland, short of food and medicine.
For the first time in the month since the government unleashed the Ghouta offensive, one of the deadliest of the war, residents are fleeing in their thousands.
The Syrian army and allied forces have recaptured 70 percent of the territory that was under insurgent control in the enclave, it said on Friday.
The military statement said it secured the exit of thousands of civilians. ""The army's general command calls on the sons of our noble people to come out,"" it added. 
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor, said air strikes in eastern Ghouta killed 80 people, including 14 children, in the rebel towns of Kafr Batna, Saqba and Harasta on Friday. 
Moscow and Damascus accuse rebels of having forced people to stay. The rebels deny this and say the government aims to depopulate opposition areas.
Syrian State TV broadcast footage of men, women and children walking along a dirt road near the town of Hammouriyeh, many of them carrying bags, towards army positions. Some waved to the camera and said the factions had stopped them from going out.
The mayor of the nearby army-held town of Adra, Jassem al-Mahmoud, said around 5,000 people were sheltering there so far and as many as 50,000 were expected, who would be guaranteed food and medical help.
The outflow began on Thursday with thousands fleeing the southernmost of the Ghouta pockets. The spokesman for Failaq al-Rahman, the rebel faction controlling that zone, says the safety of civilians cannot be guaranteed in government areas. 
The fighters refused a Russian proposal for local talks inside Syria over surrendering and leaving their enclave, added Wael Olwan, who is based in Turkey.
The Ghouta factions, including Failaq, said they were ready to talk directly with Moscow in Geneva about a ceasefire. 
During offensives elsewhere, Damascus has taken turf after allowing rebel fighters and opposition activists to leave for opposition areas near Turkey. Russia has offered similar safe passage to rebels in eastern Ghouta, but they have refused.
ALARMING REPORTS
The Ghouta and Afrin campaigns have both continued despite a U.N. Security Council demand for a 30-day ceasefire. Moscow and Damascus argue their targets in Ghouta are terrorists unprotected by the truce. Turkey says the same of the Kurdish YPG militia it is fighting in Afrin.
The foreign ministers of Turkey, Iran and Russia convened a meeting in the Kazakh capital Astana to discuss Syria. The three states last year agreed to contain the war with ""de-escalation zones"", while still pursuing their own war objectives in Syria.
Turkey wants to crush the YPG which it views as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has waged an insurgency in Turkey. The YPG became during Syria's war the key U.S. partner in the fight against Islamic State.
A Turkish air strike hit Afrin's main hospital on Friday night, killing 16 people, the YPG and the Observatory said. Turkey's army denies hitting civilians in its Afrin campaign.
Afrin's Kurdish-led civil authority said Turkey expanded air and artillery strikes on the town this week, killing dozens in the past two days. It said the main water supply was cut, and accused Ankara of trying to make residents leave.
""Till now, tens of thousands of civilians have been forced to flee, in fear of the death staring at them and their children,"" it said. ""The scale of the humanitarian tragedy has now exceeded the capacity of the administration."" 
A spokeswoman for the U.N. human rights office said it had had ""deeply alarming reports"" of civilians killed and injured in Afrin, and of the Kurds preventing civilians from leaving.
Lebanon's Al-Mayadeen TV broadcast footage from the Afrin area showing cars, small trucks, tractors and groups of people on foot leaving the town. 
An elderly man told the channel he had left on foot at 2 a.m. when shells started falling. ""There are a lot of people leaving the city as well, and a lot still inside,"" he said.

President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey had ""largely solved the Afrin issue"". ""We are nearing the end in Afrin,"" he said.

MIAMI (Reuters) - Rescue workers combed through the rubble of a pedestrian bridge that collapsed onto several lanes of traffic at Florida International University in Miami, but hopes of finding more survivors were fading early on Friday, police said.
Six people were confirmed dead after the newly built 950-ton bridge crushed vehicles on one of the busiest roads in South Florida on Thursday. With at least eight vehicles buried and out of reach beneath the rubble, the death toll could rise, Juan Perez, the Miami-Dade Police Department director, said on Friday.
""There must be some others in the vehicles,"" Perez told Miami's NewsRadio 610 WIOD. ""We know there's bodies down there and we can't get to them. It's terrible.""
Emergency personnel with sniffer dogs searched for signs of life overnight. 
At least 10 people were taken to hospitals and two remained in critical condition, officials and local media reported. 
Witnesses told local media the vehicles were stopped at a traffic light when the bridge collapsed on top of them at around 1:30 p.m. ET (1730 GMT).
At one point, police urged television helicopters to leave the area so that rescuers could hear any cries for help from those trapped beneath the collapsed structure, CBS Miami television said.
Uncertainty over the stability of remaining sections of the bridge hampered rescue efforts, officials said. 
INSTALLED ON SATURDAY
The 174-feet (53-meter) long bridge connects the university with the city of Sweetwater and was installed on Saturday in six hours over the eight-lane highway, according to a report posted on the university's website.
""If anybody has done anything wrong, we will hold them accountable,"" Florida Governor Rick Scott said at a news briefing late Thursday. 
His office earlier issued a statement saying a company contracted to inspect the bridge was not pre-qualified by the state.
The bridge was intended to provide a walkway over the busy street where an 18-year-old female FIU student from San Diego was killed as she attempted to cross it in August, according to local media reports.
Students at FIU are currently on their spring break vacation, which runs from March 12 to March 17.
To keep the inevitable disruption of traffic associated with bridge construction to a minimum, the 174-foot portion of the bridge was built adjacent to Southwest 8th Street, using a method called Accelerated Bridge Construction. It was driven into its perpendicular position across the road by a rig in only six hours on Saturday, according to a statement released by the university.
The $14.2 million bridge was designed to withstand a Category 5 hurricane, the most dangerous measure by the National Hurricane Center, and built to last 100 years, the university said. 
Officials with the National Transportation Safety Board were on the scene early on Friday to investigate why it collapsed.

1030,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 09:27AM ET</span>",Greek court rejects extradition of Turkish coup fugitives,"By Constantinos Georgizas
ATHENS (Reuters) - A Greek court on Friday dismissed a Turkish demand for the handover of eight Turkish soldiers accused by Ankara of having played a direct role in the abortive coup against President Tayyip Erdogan in 2016.
It was the third request by Turkey to extradite the same eight suspects which Greek courts have rejected, an issue which has further strained frosty relations between the two NATO allies at odds over a host of issues from airspace to mineral rights in the Aegean Sea.
The court said it was not convinced the eight would face a fair trial in their country. 
""Justice rose to the occasion and it is a day of joy for the eight of them,"" their lawyer Omiros Zelios told reporters.
The group - three majors, three captains and two sergeant majors - fled to Greece in a helicopter on July 16, 2016, as the coup attempt against Erdogan crumbled. 
Turkey says they are traitors and coup plotters and has repeatedly demanded they be returned. Erdogan himself has addressed the issue several times, accusing Greece of reneging on a pledge to swiftly send them back.
The issue has posed a quandary for Athens, keen to keep relations with Ankara on an even keel but uncompromising that judicial decisions are independent. 
That dilemma has come into even sharper focus since the arrest, on March 2, of two Greek soldiers who crossed the border into Turkey in bad weather. There has been no overt connection of the two issues, though plenty of speculation. 
Appearing before the Athens-based Court of Appeal dressed in smart suits, the group were silent as they heard the verdict. They have been in protective custody since their arrival in Greece almost 18 months ago.
The eight face eight charges in Turkey ranging from involvement in the coup, attempted murder, participation in an armed terrorist group, military desertion and theft of military material. 
But in its ruling, the court said the charges were vague and had introduced no new elements to overturn earlier rulings in favor of the eight. There is no limit to the number of times a country can request the extradition of the same suspects, but one of the grounds for having fresh requests considered is the introduction of new charges or evidence against defendants.

""In each case there are valid concerns of an unfair trial, and the risk of facing torture and humiliating behavior,"" a court official said, citing the ruling.

1031,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 07:06AM ET</span>","Facing far-right challenge, minister says Islam doesn't belong to Germany","BERLIN (Reuters) - New Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said Islam does not belong to Germany and set out hardline immigration policies in an interview published on Friday, as he sought to see off rising far-right challengers.
Seehofer told Bild newspaper he would push through a ""master plan for quicker deportations"", in his first major interview since he was sworn into office on Wednesday.
The minister - a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's CSU Bavarian allies who are further to the right than her own Christian Democrats (CDU) - said he would also classify more states as 'safe' countries of origin, which would make it easier to deport failed asylum seekers.
The statements come after Merkel's conservatives, and their coalition allies - the Social Democrats - lost ground to the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in elections last year.
Seehofer is particularly keen to show his party is tackling immigration ahead of Bavaria's October regional election, when the AfD is expected to enter that state assembly.
""Islam does not belong to Germany,"" Seehofer said, contradicting former German president Christian Wulff who fueled a debate over immigration in 2010 by saying Islam was part of Germany.
In 2015 Merkel echoed Wulff's words at a time when anti-immigration campaign group PEGIDA - or Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West - was holding marches.
""LIVE WITH US""
""Of course the Muslims living here do belong to Germany,"" Seehofer said before going on to say Germany should not give up its own traditions or customs, which had Christianity at their heart.
""My message is: Muslims need to live with us, not next to us or against us,"" he said. 
The government estimates between 4.4 and 4.7 million Muslims are living in Germany. Many of them have a Turkish background and many of the more than a million migrants who have arrived in the country from the Middle East and elsewhere after Merkel adopted an open-door policy in mid-2015 are also Muslims.
Andre Poggenburg, head of the AfD in the eastern state of Saxony, said Seehofer was copying his party with a view to Bavaria's October regional election: ""Horst Seehofer has taken this message from our manifesto word for word,"" he said.
The far-left Linke and Greens condemned Seehofer's message, and the Social Democrats' Natascha Kohnen told broadcaster n-tv: ""Saying that incites people against each other at a time when we really don't need that. What we really need is politicians who bring people together.""
In a coalition agreement, Merkel's CDU/CSU conservative bloc and the Social Democrats agreed they would manage and limit migration to Germany and Europe to avoid a re-run of the 2015 refugee crisis.

They also said they did not expect migration (excluding labor migration) to rise above the range of 180,000 to 220,000 per year.

People who would be put on the restricted lists included those found to have committed acts like spreading false information about terrorism and causing trouble on flights, as well as those who used expired tickets or smoked on trains, according to two statements issued on the National Development and Reform Commission's website on Friday. 
Those found to have committed financial wrongdoings, such as employers who failed to pay social insurance or people who have failed to pay fines, would also face these restrictions, said the statements which were dated March 2. 
It added that the rules would come into effect on May 1.
The move is in line with President's Xi Jinping's plan to construct a social credit system based on the principle of ""once untrustworthy, always restricted"", said one of the notices which was signed by eight ministries, including the country's aviation regulator and the Supreme People's Court.
China has flagged plans to roll out a system that will allow government bodies to share information on its citizens' trustworthiness and issue penalties based on a so-called social credit score.
However, there are signs that the use of social credit scoring on domestic transport could have started years ago. In early 2017, the country's Supreme People's Court said during a press conference that 6.15 million Chinese citizens had been banned from taking flights for social misdeeds.

1033,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 05:31AM ET</span>",French minister talks of rail liberalization delay as strike looms,"By Brian Love
PARIS (Reuters) - France's transport minister said on Friday she was ready to negotiate with rail unions preparing to stage a wave of strikes, including on a possible delay to opening up the state-run network to competition.
The four main rail unions on Thursday called for a wave of strikes over three months from April, setting up a confrontation with President Emmanuel Macron and his government that will be fraught with risks for both sides.
Minister Elisabeth Borne described the strike call over the government's plan to revamp the SNCF group before liberalization of the network from 2020 as irresponsible. However, she told CNews TV: ""The government's not looking for a showdown ... There are things we are prepared to discuss."" 
French unions are weaker and more divided than in 1995, when widespread rail strikes over social welfare reforms paralyzed parts of France and public support for industrial action is less ardent than it once was. But a prolonged strike could still hurt Macron's presidency, still in its first year.
Borne said she was open to negotiation on a range of issues, such as the start date for allowing private operators to compete with state-owned SNCF. 
""The start of open competition is something that was decided during a previous presidential mandate and regional leaders want to see happen, but the start dates are up for negotiation.""
Borne said this would apply to the Ile de France region that includes Paris and its surrounding area, where rail services carry as much as half of the nationwide daily total of about four million train passengers.
EU liberalization accords are due to end national rail monopoly services from 2020 onwards, but Borne dangled the possibility of a far longer feed-in time before the SNCF faces the full brunt of open competition.
""What will that date be? 2025, 2030, 2033? That's part of what's up for negotiation,"" she said.
She reiterated the government's readiness to assume all or part of the SNCF's nearly 50 billion euros ($60 billion) of debt but only if the company made sweeping changes that meant it would no longer be loss-making.
A major flashpoint in the reform, billed as the biggest since the nationalization of the railways in the 1930s, is the proposal to abolish the special employment status SNCF railworkers have enjoyed for decades - a job-for-life contract with automatic annual pay rises and a right to retire years before most other French workers.

The strikes are planned to hit two out of every five days over a three-month period, from April 3. That, however, may leave time for enough progress to stave off the walkout.

PRETORIA (Reuters) - Former South African president Jacob Zuma is to face corruption charges over a $2.5 billion arms deal, prosecutors said, as a years-old scandal returned to haunt him within weeks of his fall from power. 
It was a stunning judicial development on a continent where political ""Big Men"" rarely have to face their accusers in court.
Zuma, who was forced to resign by his ruling African National Congress (ANC) last month, was at the center of a 1990s deal to buy European military kit that has cast a shadow over politics in South Africa for years.
Chief state prosecutor Shaun Abrahams told a media conference on Friday that Zuma's attempts to head off the charges hanging over him for more than a decade had failed.
The 75-year-old denied all the allegations against him, Abrahams added.
""After consideration of the matter, I am of the view that there are reasonable prospects of successful prosecution of Mr Zuma on the charges listed in the indictment,"" Abrahams said.
""I am of the view that a trial court would be the most appropriate forum for these issues to be ventilated and to be decided upon.""
Zuma will face 16 charges relating to 783 instances of alleged wrongdoing, National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku said.
Twelve are of fraud, one of racketeering, two of corruption and one of money laundering.
There was no immediate comment from Zuma and it was not immediately clear when the former leader might go to trial.
Zuma was deputy president at the time of the arms deal. Schabir Shaikh, his former financial adviser, was found guilty and jailed in 2005 for trying to solicit bribes for Zuma from a French arms company.
The 16 counts were filed against Zuma but then dropped by the NPA shortly before he successfully ran for president in 2009.
Since his election nine years ago, his opponents have fought a lengthy legal battle to have the charges reinstated. Zuma countered with his own legal challenges.
The ANC said it had confidence in the country's criminal justice system and the independence of the judiciary. 
""We continue to assert the inalienable right of all in our country, including Comrade Jacob Zuma, to be presumed innocent until and if proven guilty,"" the party said in a statement.
""A VICTORY,"" SAYS OPPOSITION
Mmusi Maimane, the official opposition leader and head of the Democratic Alliance party, said: ""This is a victory for all who have fought for years for Jacob Zuma to face accountability for his crimes. That accountability starts now.""
Pierre de Vos, a law professor at the University of Cape Town, said Zuma could seek a court order to block the case against him by asking for ""a permanent stay of prosecution so that the court decides whether he is capable of getting a fair trial. That could be done of course, that is a possibility"".
In 2016, Zuma said a four-year investigation he set up while president had found no evidence of widespread bribery, corruption or fraud in the selection of bidders to supply the arms. Nor had it found evidence that officials were bribed in an attempt to influence the deal.
The former South African leader was beset by scandal during his tenure as president. 
He survived several motions of no-confidence in parliament and the Constitutional Court said he breached the law by ignoring an order to repay some of the $16 million in state funds spent on renovating his home. Zuma has since repaid some of the money, as ordered by the court.
The former president has also been implicated by South Africa's anti-corruption watchdog in a 2016 report that alleges the Gupta family, billionaire friends of Zuma, used links with him to win state contracts. An inquiry on the influence-peddling allegations is due to start soon.

The Guptas and Zuma have denied any wrongdoing.

1035,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 05:22AM ET</span>",Timeline - The rise of Chinese leader Xi Jinping,"By John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - President Xi Jinping, China's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, will be re-elected to a second five-year term as president on Saturday by the rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress.
The son of Communist Party revolutionary and one-time deputy prime minister Xi Zhongxun, the younger Xi spent decades working his way up party and government ranks, but his consolidation of power since becoming head of the party in 2012 has been unprecedented.
Xi's ascent culminated last week in parliament's passing of a constitutional amendment that eliminated term limits for the presidency, discarding a rule that had helped keep leaders in check and underpinned collective decision-making for 35 years.
Following are some key dates in Xi's life and rise to power:
June 15, 1953 - XI IS BORN
Xi Jinping is born in Beijing a ""princeling"" child of an official. His father, Xi Zhongxun, fought in the Communist revolution and later served as an official, rising to become a liberal-minded vice premier. The young Xi grew up among the party elite but saw his father purged and later jailed during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, only to be rehabilitated and allowed back into government after Mao's death.
1974 - PARTY MAN
After being sent to work in the poverty-stricken countryside, in Shaanxi province, as a teenager during the Cultural Revolution, Xi joins the Communist Youth League and then, in 1974, the party, at the age of about 21.
Sept. 9, 1976 - MAO DIES
Mao Zedong, the ""Great Helmsman"", dies at the age of 82. Xi is 23 and a chemical engineering student at Tsinghua University. China goes into mourning and Hua Guofeng, Mao's handpicked successor, takes over. For a time, Hua is treated like Mao, but he is eventually sidelined by Deng Xiaoping who sets China on a more practical, less dogmatic, path.
Dec. 4, 1982 - TERM LIMITS INTRODUCED
The National People's Congress adopts a new constitution that includes provisions that limit presidents and vice presidents to two five-year terms. The introduction of term limits was an attempt to prevent China from sliding back into strongman rule after Mao's tumultuous 27-year reign.
Oct. 21, 2007 - ELITE COMMITTEE
Xi is promoted into the Politburo Standing Committee, the most elite political body, directly from the Central Committee, after stints in the government and party in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces and Shanghai. He and Li Keqiang, the current premier, are considered to be likely successors to then-president and party chief Hu Jintao. Xi also becomes a vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission.
March 15, 2008 - VICE PRESIDENT
The National People's Congress elects Xi vice president.
Nov. 15, 2012 - TOP POSITIONS
Xi is named general secretary of the Communist Party, and also becomes chairman of the Central Military Commission. Holding the top positions in the party and military, Xi starts to maneuver to consolidate his power.
Dec. 2012 - ANTI-CORRUPTION SALVOS FIRED
Xi pledges to crack down on ""tigers and flies"" in the party and launches what is to become China's most sweeping anti-corruption drive. The campaign becomes popular with the public but critics accuse Xi of using it to neutralize political opponents. Thousands of officials are punished for corruption or ""discipline violations"", including former Politburo Standing Committee member Zhou Yongkang. Xi uses the campaign to clean out the senior ranks of the military.
March 14, 2013 - PRESIDENT
The National People's Congress elects Xi president. While the presidency is the least powerful of Xi's key roles, it is symbolically critical and provides Xi a platform on which he can promote China's interests on the global stage.
Oct. 24, 2017 - ENSHRINED
The 19th Party Congress enshrines Xi's political thinking - ""Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era"" - into the party's constitution. Because Xi is still serving in office, this move is widely interpreted as placing him in the same company as the founder of modern China, Mao, and cementing his power. Xi's signature ""Belt and Road"" initiative to invest trillions of yuan in trade links with central Asia and Europe was also included in the party constitution, lending it weight.
Oct. 25, 2017 - PARTY CHIEF AGAIN
Xi is handed a second term as general secretary of the party during the 19th Party Congress.
March 11, 2018 - END OF TERM LIMITS
The National People's Congress votes nearly unanimously to abolish term limits for the presidency. There are two votes against, three abstentions and one invalid vote. The elimination of limits catches many by surprise and while delegates to parliament and official media say it reflects the ""will of the people"", many privately express concern.
March 17, 2018 - SECOND TERM AS PRESIDENT
The National People's Congress is due to elect Xi president for a second five-year term. Second terms have been the norm: Xi's most recent predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, both served two terms.
At the October Party Congress, however, the party broke with tradition and installed no obvious successor to Xi in the Politburo Standing Committee. Analysts had speculated that Xi might anoint a successor during his second term as party chief and president. The elimination of term limits throws that into question.

1036,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 12:01PM ET</span>",Russia to expel UK diplomats as crisis over nerve toxin attack deepens,"By Olzhas Auyezov and Guy Faulconbridge
ASTANA/LONDON (Reuters) - Russia is set to expel British diplomats in retaliation for Prime Minister Theresa May's decision to kick out 23 Russians as relations with London crashed to a post-Cold War low over an attack involving a military-grade nerve agent on English soil.
After the first known offensive use of such a weapon in Europe since World War Two, May pointed the finger squarely at President Vladimir Putin and gave the 23 Russians who she said were spies working under diplomatic cover at the London embassy a week to leave.
Russia has denied any involvement, cast Britain as a post-colonial power unsettled by Brexit, and even suggested London fabricated the attack in an attempt to whip up anti-Russian hysteria.
Asked by a Reuters reporter in the Kazakh capital Astana if Russia planned to expel British diplomats from Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov smiled and said: ""We will, of course.""
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia could announce its response at any minute.
Britain, the United States, Germany and France jointly called on Russia on Thursday to explain the attack. U.S. President Donald Trump said it looked as though the Russians were behind it.
A German government spokesman called the attack ""an immense, appalling event"". Chancellor Angela Merkel said an EU summit next week would discuss the issue, in the first instance to seek clarity. She added that any boycott of the soccer World Cup, which Russia will host in June and July, was not an immediate priority.
INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION
Russia has refused Britain's demands to explain how Novichok, a nerve agent developed by the Soviet military, was used to strike down Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, in the southern English city of Salisbury.
But in an unexpected twist, Russian investigators said on Friday they had opened a criminal investigation into the attempted murder of Yulia Skripal and stood ready to cooperate with British authorities. 
They also opened a murder investigation into the death of Nikolai Glushkov, a former associate of the late tycoon Boris Berezovsky. Glushkov, 68, was discovered dead on Monday in south-west London. British police said they were treating Glushkov's death as unexplained, but did not think it was linked to the attack on the Skripals.
Russian investigators offered some cooperation to British authorities after the 2006 London murder of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko too. Britain said it was not enough though, and in 2016, a judge-led inquiry concluded that Putin had probably approved Litvinenko's murder, something Moscow denies. 
Britain has written to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague, which monitors compliance with the global convention outlawing the use of such weapons, to obtain independent verification of the substance used.
Skripal, a former colonel in the GRU who betrayed dozens of Russian agents to British intelligence, and his daughter have been critically ill since March 4, when they were found unconscious on a bench.
A British policeman was also poisoned when he went to help them and remains in a serious but stable condition.
British investigators are working on the theory that an item of clothing or cosmetics or a gift in the luggage of Skripal's daughter was impregnated with the toxin, and then opened in Skripal's house in Salisbury, the Daily Telegraph said.
Putin, a former KGB spy who is poised to win a fourth term in an election on Sunday, has so far only said publicly that Britain should get to the bottom of what has happened. 
In a sign of just how tense the relationship has become, British and Russian ministers used openly insulting language while the Russian ambassador said Britain was trying to divert attention from the difficulties it was having managing its exit from the European Union.
""SHOCKING AND UNFORGIVABLE""
British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Britain's quarrel was not with the Russian people but with the Kremlin.
""We have nothing against the Russians themselves. There is to be no Russophobia as a result of what is happening,"" he said.
""Our quarrel is with Putin’s Kremlin, and with his decision – and we think it overwhelmingly likely that it was his decision – to direct the use of a nerve agent on the streets of the UK.""
The Kremlin's Peskov called the allegation that Putin was involved ""a shocking and unforgivable breach of the diplomatic rules of decent behavior"", TASS news agency reported.
British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson sparked particular outrage in Moscow with his blunt comment on Thursday that ""Russia should go away, it should shut up"".
Russia's Defence Ministry said he was an ""intellectual impotent"" and Lavrov said he probably lacked education. Williamson studied social science at the University of Bradford.
""Well he's a nice man, I'm told, maybe he wants to claim a place in history by making some bold statements,"" Lavrov said. ""Maybe he lacks education, I don’t know.""
In London, opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn struck a starkly different tone to that of the British government by warning against rushing into a new Cold War before full evidence of Moscow's culpability was proven. 
Corbyn added that Labour did not support Putin and that Russia should be held to account if it was behind the attack.

""That does not mean we should resign ourselves to a 'new Cold War' of escalating arms spending, proxy conflicts across the globe and a McCarthyite intolerance of dissent,"" he said.

1037,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 05:10AM ET</span>","Philippines informs U.N. of ICC withdrawal, says committed to fight impunity","MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines has notified the U.N. secretary-general of its decision to withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC), but has assured the United Nations of its commitment to the rule of law.
President Rodrigo Duterte is pulling the Philippines out of the ICC after a court prosecutor announced last month that a preliminary examination was underway into an accusation that the president and top officials had committed crimes against humanity during a deadly war on drugs.
Duterte, known for his tough stand on crime, has repeatedly denied he ordered police to kill drug suspects. Police deny activists' accusations of murder and cover-ups and say the more than 4,000 people killed in police encounters were armed and resisted arrest.
""The government affirms its commitment to fight against impunity for atrocity crimes, notwithstanding its withdrawal from the Rome Statute, especially since the Philippines has a national legislation punishing atrocity crimes,"" the government said in a letter dated Thursday and addressed to the U.N. secretary-general.
The Rome Statute is the founding treaty of the ICC. The Philippines ratified it in 2011.
The Philippines' permanent representative to the United Nations, Teodoro Locsin, published the letter on his Twitter account.
The decision to withdraw was a ""principled stand against those who politicize and weaponize human rights"", the government added in the letter.
The withdrawal takes effect one year after the secretary-general receives notification, according to ICC rules.
Duterte's spokesman, Harry Roque, said on Thursday the ICC examination into the killing of drug suspects ""violates the very fundamental basis by which we gave our consent to be bound by the ICC"", referring to the principle of complementarity.
Under such principle, the ICC can step in and exercise jurisdiction if states are unable or unwilling to investigate crimes.
Roque said Philippine courts were functioning well and exercise jurisdiction over any complaints.
International jurist groups and activists have criticized Duterte for what they say is an attempt to evade justice.
Lawyers say the withdrawal does not insulate Duterte from a possible indictment, as the ICC's jurisdiction retroactively covers the period during which a country was a member of the court.

Booing the national anthem has become a common form of political protest at soccer matches in Hong Kong, as youths express frustration at perceived creeping influence of Communist Party rulers in Beijing over the city's culture and freedoms.
If passed, the proposed bill, submitted to the Legislative Council, would also make it a legal requirement for schools to teach the anthem, the ""March of the Volunteers"", its history and its ""spirit"".
A new law banning disrespect for the anthem came into force in mainland China last year, but it was not automatically applicable to Hong Kong, a former British colony handed back to China in 1997 under promises that its core freedoms would remain intact under a ""one country, two systems"" formula.
But China in November formally extended the law to the freewheeling financial hub, forcing the government to pass new legislation under its separate common law legal system.
The proposal comes as concerns mount over the perceived erosion of ""one country, two systems"", with Britain's half-yearly report on Hong Kong saying its high degree of autonomy was coming ""under increasing pressure"".
The Hong Kong government said in response foreign governments should not interfere in its internal affairs.
Hong Kong has already outlawed the desecration of national flags and emblems, also punishable by three years' jail, but no equivalent laws are in place for the anthem.
Soccer fans' defiance has resulted in world soccer body FIFA fining the Hong Kong Football Association, but no punishment from local authorities.
Under the proposed bill, performing the song in a manner harmful to its ""dignity"" would be illegal.
A person who ""publicly and wilfully alters the lyrics or the score"", performs the song in a ""distorted or derogatory manner"" or insults the anthem in any other way could be liable to three years imprisonment and a HK$50,000 ($6,375.11) fine, it said.
References to the promotion of patriotism in the mainland Chinese law do not appear in the proposed Hong Kong bill which is expected to pass easily when it comes to a vote as the opposition does not have enough seats to block routine legislation.
The date of voting has yet to be announced.
""If the bill becomes a reality, this would harm the public's basic rights,"" said opposition Democratic Party leader Wu Chi-wai in a statement. 
""If protesters argue with people who play the national anthem or make gestures at them, even if they do not intend to insult the national anthem, they may get charged by the authorities.""

1040,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",British Labour leader warns of rushing into new Cold War without full evidence,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn warned on Friday against rushing into a new Cold War with Russia before full evidence of Moscow's culpability in a military-grade nerve toxin attack on a former double agent is proven. 
Prime Minister Theresa May said Russia was behind the Novichok nerve agent attack on Sergei Skripal, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who betrayed dozens of Russian agents to Britain.
Skripal and his daughter Yulia have been critically ill in hospital since March 4 when they were found slumped unconscious on a bench outside a shopping center in the English city of Salisbury. A British policeman was also injured.
After the first known offensive use of such a weapon on European soil since World War Two, May gave 23 Russians who she said were spies working under diplomatic cover at the London embassy a week to leave.
But Corbyn, who has been criticized for taking a much more cautious approach to the poisoning, said that rushing ahead of the evidence in a fevered atmosphere did not serve national security.
""To rush way ahead of the evidence being gathered by the police, in a fevered parliamentary atmosphere, serves neither justice nor our national security,"" he wrote in an article in the Guardian newspaper. 
""This horrific event demands first of all the most thorough and painstaking criminal investigation.""
The 68-year-old socialist leader said Labour did not support Putin and that Russia should be held to account if it was behind the attack.
""That does not mean we should resign ourselves to a 'new cold war' of escalating arms spending, proxy conflicts across the globe and a McCarthyite intolerance of dissent,"" Corbyn said.
Corbyn suggested that the Russian mafia, which he said had been allowed to gain a toehold in Britain, might be behind the attack and said Britain should stop accepting corrupt money from the former Soviet Union.
""We must stop servicing Russian crony capitalism in Britain, and the corrupt billionaires who use London to protect their wealth,"" he said.
""We agree with the government’s action in relation to Russian diplomats, but measures to tackle the oligarchs and their loot would have a far greater impact on Russia’s elite than limited tit-for-tat expulsions.""

Corbyn was once written off by both his own party and May's Conservatives, but his unexpectedly strong result in last year's national election has convinced many of Labour's opponents that Corbyn is a potential prime minister if May's government falls.

Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were found slumped unconscious on a bench outside a shopping center in the genteel southern English city of Salisbury on March 4. They have been in a critical condition in hospital ever since.
Yulia Skripal flew to London from Russia on March 3, according to counter-terrorism police. 
British investigators are working on the theory that the toxin was impregnated in an item of clothing or cosmetics or in a gift that was opened in Skripal's house in Salisbury, the Telegraph said, citing the unidentified sources.
Britain has said the toxin, which also poisoned a British police officer who attended the scene, was Novichok, a lethal nerve agent first developed by the Soviet military.
After the first known offensive use of such a weapon on European soil since World War Two, Britain has pinned the blame on Moscow and given 23 Russians who it said were spies working under diplomatic cover at the London embassy a week to leave.

Britain, the United States, Germany and France jointly called on Russia on Thursday to explain how the toxin came to be used on British soil. Russia has denied any involvement and has accused London of whipping up anti-Russian hysteria.

QUANG NGAI, Vietnam (Reuters) - Vietnam marked 50 years since the My Lai massacre on Friday in a memorial ceremony at the site of the killings that was attended by survivors of the massacre, their families, and around 60 U.S. Vietnam War veterans and anti-war activists. 
American soldiers killed 504 people on March 16, 1968, in Son My, a collection of hamlets between the central Vietnamese coast and a ridge of misty mountains, in an incident known in the West as the My Lai Massacre. 
""After peace was restored in the country, the people of Son My overcame pain with forgiveness and opened their arms to sincerely welcome U.S. veterans here as a place of pilgrimage, a place to face the truth, face themselves and find peace of mind in a receiving land,"" Dang Ngoc Dung, deputy chairman of the Quang Ngai Province People's Committee, said at the event.
Survivors of the massacre told Reuters of the darkness and silence in the hours after the killings as they struggled to bury the dead in fear that the Americans might attack again.
It was the worst recorded U.S. war crime committed in Vietnam but the ceremony at the site, now a memorial to the victims, was relatively low key amid warming ties between Washington and Hanoi.
The ceremony fell just a week after a landmark visit by a U.S. aircraft carrier to the nearby port city of Danang, evidence of warming ties between the former foes.
A delegation of U.S. Vietnam War veterans and anti-war activists met Dung and other Vietnamese officials privately in a small function room after the ceremony.
The veterans and activists said they were preparing to send a letter, on behalf of the United States, apologizing for the massacre.
""In just a short time, more than 600 people have signed it,"" said Chuck Searcy, Vice President of Veterans for Peace.

""It expresses the remorse, regret and sorrow of Americans and our shared responsibility for what happened here,"" he said.

Beijing has campaigned against the spread of ""Western values"" at universities, and the ruling Communist Party's anti-corruption watchdog has sent inspectors to monitor teachers for ""improper"" remarks in class.
Speaking on the sidelines of the annual meeting of last year's parliament session, Education Minister Chen Baosheng said students were often there in body but not spirit at political education courses, in a rare admission of the difficulties faced enforcing a key government policy.
But in the last year there had been big changes, Chen said at his annual news conference coinciding with this year's parliamentary meeting.
The ministry had sent more than 200 experts in political education into more than 2,500 higher education establishments and sat in on more than 3,000 classes, Chen said.
Questionnaires were given to more than 30,000 students of whom more than 91 percent said they now found the classes ""edifying"", he added.
""In some schools' political education classes, (getting in) is like the difficulty of getting a ticket for the high speed rail over Spring Festival,"" Chen said, referring to the Lunar New Year holiday when millions pack trains, planes and cars to get home. 
""With the hard work of the last year, there's been a massive change. But we clearly recognize that these results are initial ones, and they need to be further strengthened and consolidated.""
Crackdowns on what academics and students can say and should think are nothing new in China. 
Curriculums and speech at universities, in particular, are tightly controlled by the government, fearful of a repeat of the pro-democracy protests in 1989 that were led by students and eventually crushed by the military.
In 2013, a liberal Chinese economist who had been an outspoken critic of the party was expelled from the elite Peking University.
A year later, the university, once a bastion of free speech in China, established a 24-hour system to monitor public opinion on the internet and take early measures to control and reduce negative speech, according to a party journal at the time.
China aims to build world-class universities and some of its top schools fair well in international rankings by various standards. However, critics argue constraints on academic freedom could inhibit those ambitions.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Indonesia has lobbied Southeast Asian countries to carry out maritime patrols in the disputed South China Sea, claimed in most part by China, to improve security, Defence Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu said on Friday.
Indonesia says it's a non-claimant state in the South China Sea dispute but has clashed with China over fishing rights around the Natuna Islands and expanded its military presence there, and also renamed the northern reaches of its exclusive economic zone, asserting its own maritime claim.
Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Defence Minister Marise Payne held talks with their Indonesian counterparts Retno Marsudi and Ryacudu in Sydney, ahead of an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit.
Australia is hosting the meeting, despite not being a member of the 10-nation bloc, as it seeks to tighten political and trade ties in the region amid China's rising influence.
""For the South China Sea, I went around to friends - ASEAN defense ministers - so that each country that faces the South China Sea patrols up to 200 nautical miles, around 230 kilometers,"" Ryacudu told reporters at a joint press conference.
Indonesia is focusing on three areas, notably the Sulu Sea, the Malacca Strait and the seas around the coast of Thailand, Ryacudu said, referring to existing cooperation with Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines.
""If we look at the (borders) from Vietnam down to Indonesia and to the Philippines, we can see we have secured almost half of the South China Sea (in areas) we are already patrolling.""
China claims most of the South China Sea, an important trade route and which is believed to contain large quantities of oil and natural gas, and has been building artificial islands on reefs, some with ports and air strips, developments that have irked ASEAN members.
China has also been rapidly increasingly its military deployment in the South China Sea and its air force said last month that Chinese Su-35 fighter jets took part in a combat patrol over the disputed waterway.
Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, all of which are members of ASEAN, and Taiwan also have claims in the sea.
China's foreign minister said last week that China's resolve to protect peace and stability in the South China Sea was unshakeable, and that outside forces were attempting to muddy the waters.
China has been angered in the past by freedom of navigation patrols in the South China Sea by the United States which it sees as provocative.
Australia - which says it takes no sides on South China Sea disputes but has supported U.S.-led freedom of navigation activities - has previously said it had no plans to take part in joint patrols.
Officially, the ASEAN summit will focus on fostering closer economic ties among the members of ASEAN and Australia, and countering the threat of Islamist militants returning to the region from the Middle East.
Australian Foreign Minister Bishop also said Australia would ""very seriously"" consider any formal invitation to join the grouping, a move advocated by Indonesian President Joko Widodo.

The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule and set up a government in exile in the foothills of Dharamsala. Chinese troops had seized control of Tibet nine years earlier. 
He says he only seeks autonomy for his homeland, not outright independence. He has also expressed a desire to return to Tibet. 
""I always, you see, admire the spirit of (the) European Union,"" the Dalai Lama said in a video message to the International Campaign for Tibet on the Washington D.C.-based group's 30th anniversary on Thursday. 
""Common interest (is) more important rather than one's own national interest. With that kind of concept, I am very much willing to remain within the People's Republic of China. The Chinese word, ""gongheguo"" (republic), shows some kind of union is there.""
China says Tibet in an integral part of its territory and has been for centuries. Beijing also says its rule ended serfdom and brought prosperity to what was a backward region, and that it fully respects the rights of the Tibetan people.
Beijing insists that the Dalai Lama is a ""splittist"" in a monk's robes and has warned foreign leaders against meeting him, even in a personal capacity.
Donald Trump has not met with the Dalai Lama since become president in January last year. All recent U.S. presidents before Trump had held meetings with the Dalai Lama.
While the Dalai Lama reiterated his desire for reconciliation as Xi Jinping begins his second five-year term as China's president, he also said the Tibetan issue was not about to go away.
""Among the Chinese hard-liners, in their mind, it seems some kind of dilemma is there about their present policy - whether, you see, it can solve Tibetan problem or not,"" he said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian political party that governs a southern state quit Prime Minister Narendra Modi's coalition on Friday blaming it for a lack of financial support, officials said, in a blow to the coalition ahead of national elections next year.
The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) controls 16 lawmakers in India's 545-member parliament, but Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition remains in majority.
The party, that runs Andhra Pradesh, had been demanding greater financial assistance ever since the division of the state in 2014 which it says led to loss of revenue.
""We tried our best to be together but the present government ignored the sentiments and emotions of the people of Andhra Pradesh,"" Y.S. Chowdary, a TDP member of parliament, said. 
Last week, the party pulled its two federal ministers from the government after talks with Modi's emissaries failed and on Friday it announced it was pulling all its MPs out of the federal coalition.
The loss of the regional ally is the second since January when the right wing Hindu group, the Shiv Sena, announced it would not run in next year's national election in alliance with the BJP. 
Modi has run the ruling coalition with a tight hand, analysts say. The BJP blamed the TDP for the row and said it would build up its own strength in Andhra Pradesh. 
""People of Andhra Pradesh have now realized that the TDP is resorting to lies to cover up its inept governance,"" said BJP spokesman G.V.L.N. Rao.
The BJP's troubles with its regional partners come at a time opposition parties are trying to band together ahead of next year's election.

SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - South Korea said on Friday it was seeking high-level talks this month with North Korea to prepare for a summit and that South Korean President Moon Jae-in may meet Donald Trump before the U.S. president's planned meeting with the North Korean leader.
Amid a flurry of diplomacy from Asia to Europe to Washington, Trump reaffirmed his plan to meet with North Korea's Kim Jong Un by the end of May during a phone call on Friday with Moon and both voiced ""cautious optimism"" about efforts to resolve the crisis over North Korea's nuclear weapons.
A White House statement said Trump and Moon discussed preparations for their upcoming engagements with Pyongyang and agreed that ""concrete actions,"" not words, were the key to denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
They ""emphasized that a brighter future is available for North Korea, if it chooses the correct path,"" it said.
Earlier, Moon's chief of staff, Im Jong-seok, said proposed North-South talks in late March would cover key agenda topics and other details of the pending summit between Moon and Kim.
The New York Times reported on Friday that Central Intelligence Agency chief Mike Pompeo, whom Trump nominated this week to replace Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, has been playing a lead role in planning the talks and has been conducting back-channel communications with North Korean representatives.
Pompeo has engaged with counterparts through a channel that runs between the CIA. and North Korean counterpart, the Reconnaissance General Bureau. He remains in close touch with the director of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, Suh Hoon, said a U.S. official familiar with the preparations. 
For many years, the main and often only channels of official communication between Washington and Pyongyang have been South Korea's intelligence service and North Korea's UN Mission in the United States, the official added.
The official confirmed that Pompeo has taken the lead on planning because after the departure of Joe Yun, the State Department's point person on North Korea, intelligence agencies are the main source of expertise on the country. 
The planning is at ""a very early stage,"" the official said. 
If North Korea agrees to the talks, they would offer an opportunity for Pyongyang to break its silence on what Seoul says is Kim's desire to meet Trump and Moon and his willingness to freeze his country's nuclear and missile programs. 
""We've decided to narrow down the agenda topics to denuclearizing the Korean peninsula, securing permanent peace to ease military tension and new, bold ways to take inter-Korean relations forward,"" Im, the head of South Korea's summit preparation team, told reporters.
Im said Moon may meet Trump after an inter-Korean summit but before Trump's planned summit with Kim in May.
South Korea's Yonhap news agency said Moon pledged in the call with Trump to cooperate closely with Washington on summit diplomacy. Trump asked South Korean officials to show flexibility in trade negotiations with the United States in the call, the South Korean presidency said.
Even amid North Korea tensions, Trump has repeatedly denounced a U.S. free trade deal with ally South Korea as ""unfair"" and threatened many times to scrap it.
Senior South Korean officials met Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang this month and told Washington the North Korean leader was open to giving up his nuclear weapons if North Korea's security was guaranteed.
Trump responded with a surprise announcement that he was willing to meet Kim in a bid to resolve the crisis over North Korea's development of nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States.
TALKS IN SWEDEN
North Korea's state media has yet to comment on the content of Kim's meeting with the South Koreans, but North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho arrived in Sweden this week for talks with his Swedish counterpart Margot Wallstrom, prompting speculation he could lay the groundwork for a Trump-Kim summit.
Wallstrom's press secretary, Pezhman Fivrin, said the talks, which had been due to end late on Friday, would continue on Saturday. He declined to give further information.
Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven told a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Friday that Sweden, whose embassy represents U.S. interests in Pyongyang, was ready to act as a facilitator to help resolve tensions.
South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha was in Washington on Friday for talks on North Korea and trade, as was Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, who met U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan in the morning.
The U.S. State Department said the two sides called the announcement of a meeting between Trump and Kim a ""historic opportunity,"" while stressing that the U.S.-led campaign to press North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons through sanctions must continue until Pyongyang ""takes credible, verifiable, and concrete steps toward denuclearization.""
Kang held talks later on Friday with Sullivan, who is standing in after Trump fired Tillerson. It was not known whether the two Asian ministers would meet Pompeo.
Kang told PBS NewsHour she was ""cautiously optimistic"" denuclearization talks would happen between the United States and North Korea and that these would lead to ""a breakthrough for a peaceful resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue.""
She stressed though that full denuclearization would ""take a long while because the (North Korean nuclear) program is very advanced.""
The Japanese and South Korean ministers were expected to meet in Washington on Saturday. 
In a phone call with South Korean President Moon on Friday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed a wish for talks with North Korea following Pyongyang's planned summits with South Korea and the United States, South Korea's presidential spokesman, Kim Eui-kyeom said.
On Thursday, the head of the U.S. Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris, cautioned the United States could not be overly optimistic about the outcome of any summit between Trump and Kim and must go into it with ""eyes wide open"".
A report on Friday by intelligence analysts at Jane's by IHS Markit said satellite imagery from Feb. 25 showed gas emissions at the North's experimental light water reactor, suggesting preliminary testing had likely begun.
The reactor could be used to produce weapons-grade plutonium, but North Korea is believed to already have enough fissile material for multiple nuclear bombs, according to Joshua Pollack, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey.
An official at South Korea's defense ministry said authorities were aware of the Jane's report, which follows a similar one on the 38 North website this month that said a nearby reactor had also continued to show signs of operation.

The U.S. State Department declined to comment on the Jane's report, calling it an intelligence issue.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The wife of Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of U.S. President Donald Trump, has filed for divorce in New York, according to court records.
Vanessa Trump, a former model and actress, and Trump Jr. said in a joint statement on Thursday: ""After 12 years of marriage, we have decided to go our separate ways.""
The statement was provided by the Trump Organization, the president's business empire, which his son helps manage.
Further details were not immediately available on the uncontested divorce filing by Vanessa Trump in a New York state court. She and Trump Jr. have ""enormous respect"" for each other, according to the joint statement, which also asked for privacy.
The couple were married in 2005 and have five children. 
In recent months, Trump Jr., 40, has become enmeshed in an investigation of possible collusion between his father's presidential campaign and Russia in the 2016 presidential election. The president has denied any such collusion.
Trump Jr. arranged a 2016 meeting between a group of Russians and members of his father's campaign after an intermediary said the Russians offered damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. ""I love it,"" Trump Jr. responded to the intermediary in an email.
He has played a key role in the Trump Organization since his father entered the White House in January 2017. The president said he would maintain ownership in his hotels, golf courses and hundreds of other businesses but hand off control to his two oldest sons.
The Trump Organization's website describes Trump Jr. as an executive vice president, like his brother Eric Trump.
Last month, Vanessa Trump was taken to a New York hospital after she opened a piece of mail containing a threat and a white powder that was later determined to be non-hazardous.

Federal prosecutors in Boston earlier this month charged a Massachusetts man with sending the threatening letter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - By imposing new sanctions on Russia and condemning a suspected Russian chemical attack in Britain, Washington has hinted at a tougher stance toward Moscow despite President Donald Trump's stated desire for better ties.
The U.S. Treasury slapped sanctions on 19 Russian citizens and five entities for election meddling and cyber attacks in the most significant steps the United States has taken against Russia since Trump took office amid U.S. intelligence agency allegations that Moscow tried to help him win the 2016 election.
While the Treasury put off targeting oligarchs and officials close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, it said further sanctions were coming and for the first time blamed Moscow for cyber attacks stretching back at least two years that targeted the U.S. power grid, including nuclear facilities.
After initially equivocating about a chemical attack on a former Russian double agent in Salisbury, England, the White House joined a statement by the leaders of Britain, France and Germany in which they said they ""abhor the attack"" and blamed it on Moscow.
Moscow has denied any involvement in the poisoning.
Thursday's actions have caused some Russia analysts to ask whether the administration is taking a more confrontational stance despite Trump's repeated statements in the election campaign that he wanted a better relationship with Moscow, his praise for Putin and apparent reluctance to criticize the Russian leader.
""I think we have hit an inflection point in the current administration's approach towards Russia,"" said a diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""There has been a shift in balance.""
The diplomat attributed the evolution partly to a clash between U.S.-backed and Russian-backed forces in the Syrian city of Deir al-Zor in February; Russia pounding Syria's eastern Ghouta enclave of anti-government rebels with air strikes during the past month; and Putin showing a video on March 1 of a weapon appearing to hover over what looked like a map of Florida, home to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.
""Those three things, taken together, have caused a shift in analysis in parts ... of the administration,"" said the diplomat.
TRUMP EXASPERATED
While there was a sense at the White House that there has been a hardening of Trump's view toward Russia, at least for now, it was unclear whether this represented a long-term shift. 
A senior administration official said there was some feeling that the goodwill that Trump extended toward Russia when he took over has not been reciprocated and that the Russians do not want to have good relations with the United States.
This has exasperated Trump, who instructed his team to make sure the United States appeared to be in solidarity with Britain over the nerve agent attack.
Eugene Rumer, a former U.S. national intelligence officer for Russia, suggested Trump's approach may ultimately be guided by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether Russia meddled in the election campaign. 
The Kremlin denies interfering. Mueller is also investigating any potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow officials, something Trump denies.
""My hypothesis is ... the White House stance on Russia is going to be determined to a large extent by how much they think the investigation threatens their political position,"" Rumer said.
Officials from multiple U.S. agencies discussed next steps at a meeting on Thursday, with one aim being to avoid personally attacking Putin and taking in-your-face steps that could prompt retaliation.
In announcing Thursday's sanctions, U.S. officials made clear more would follow.
""This is just one of a series of ongoing actions that we're taking to counter Russian aggression,"" one U.S. official told reporters. ""There will be more to come, and we're going to continue to employ our resources to combat malicious Russian activity and respond to nefarious attacks.""
Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were found unconscious on a bench outside a shopping center on March 4 after being exposed to what the British authorities have identified as a military-grade, Soviet-era Novichok nerve agent.
Another U.S. official attributed the sharper edge to U.S. policy to increasingly brazen behavior by Russia in cyberspace and on the ground, culminating in the Salisbury attack.
This U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also pointed to Russia's refusal to restrain Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the role of Russian ""mercenaries"" in Syria, now entering its eighth year of civil war.
The official said it was unclear if Trump himself saw Russia as an adversary but suggested Putin may have ""overplayed his hand"" by leaving Russian fingerprints on the hacking, the chemical attack, the deployment of ground-launched cruise missiles which the U.S. says violate an arms control treaty, and a March 1 speech on ""invincible"" Russian weaponry.
""If the president felt like Putin was one-upping him, not to mention stealing the limelight, then it wouldn't be surprising that he would react,"" the official said.
While more sanctions are expected, it was not clear if the Trump policy toward Russia was changing, especially given Trump's unpredictability, said a third official, who is involved in talks on next steps.

""Tomorrow is another day,"" the official said.

Ricardo Anaya, the candidate for a right-left coalition, made his comments at a conference for private equity investment, where he also expressed openness to lowering taxes on private equity funds and reducing regulations limiting investments by the country's pension funds. 
Anaya, 39, is trailing behind frontrunner leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, 64, ahead of the July 1 elections. The ruling party's candidate, former finance minister Jose Antonio Meade, is in third place.
He said Mexico needed to face the fact that many of its manufacturing jobs will disappear in the coming years due to increased automation, adding he espoused more education spending to transform Mexico into a ""knowledge"" economy.
""The first thing we won't do are the crazy things that Trump promotes, to try to go back in time and keep digging coal mines,"" Anaya said.
""That past is not going to return and we must understand that this reality is here to stay and the answer is education.""
Anaya appeared to be referring to moves by Trump to revitalize the U.S. coal industry. 
Anaya told the conference that he believed lowering income tax rates on private equity projects could help the economy. 
""If there are more breaks and the economy grows, the government in the end will raise more. But you have to understand that will not happen immediately and so the transition would have to be gradual,"" he said. 

He also said he was open to reducing restrictions on the country's pension funds, which manage around $170 billion but have strict limits on investing in private equity projects.

WASHINGTON - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis accused Iran on Thursday of ""mucking around"" in Iraq's May parliamentary election, in which Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is seeking another term after a successful, U.S.-backed war against Islamic State militants.
The ballot will decide Iraq's leader for the next four years, when Baghdad will be faced with rebuilding cities and towns seized from Islamic State, preventing the militants' return and addressing the sectarian and economic divisions that fueled the conflict.
Among Abadi's challengers are former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and Hadi al-Amiri, a former transportation minister – both of whom are among Iran's closest
allies in neighboring Iraq.
Mattis stopped short of detailing whom Iran sought to influence but said it was doing so by channeling cash into Iraqi politics.
""We have worrisome evidence that Iran is trying to influence - using money - the Iraqi elections. That money is being used to sway candidates, to sway votes,"" Mattis told reporters as he flew back to Washington after a trip to the Middle East and Afghanistan.
""It's not an insignificant amount of money, we believe. And we think it's highly unhelpful.""
There was no immediate comment from Iran, which has in the past denied interfering in Iraq.
Mattis compared Iran's actions to those of Russia, which the U.S. intelligence community has concluded attempted to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election in favor of Donald Trump. Russia denies this.
""Iran is following Russia's example of mucking around in Iraq's elections,"" Mattis said.
He declined to say whether he thought the Iranian effort had been successful or say whether Iran sought to undermine Abadi.
Mattis said his trip to Afghanistan and the Middle East reinforced his concerns about Iran's activities in the region, from stoking violence in Syria to aiding insurgents in western Afghanistan.
The United States also accuses Iran of escalating the civil war in Yemen and threatening to turn it into a broader regional conflict by supplying advanced weaponry, including missiles, to Houthi rebels who have fired at targets in Saudi Arabia.
Mattis said Iran was using Yemen as a testing ground for its weapons. ""It's where you find their radars, their ballistic missiles, their anti-ship cruise missiles. We found their mines, their explosive boats all being tested,"" he said.
Still, the U.S. Navy told reporters traveling with Mattis that provocations by Iran had decreased in the Gulf. Iran's naval vessels halted their fairly routine, aggressive maneuvers near U.S. ships last August.
U.S. officials including Mattis said they were unsure why.
But Mattis said that the drop-off in naval maneuvers was an outlier in an otherwise clear pattern of aggressive behavior.

""It was just brought home to me again that they are not changing their behavior, they are continuing to be a destabilizing influence,"" Mattis said.

ASUNCION (Reuters) - The ruling-party candidate in Paraguay's April 22 presidential election, Mario Abdo, told Reuters on Thursday he would not raise taxes on the country's key farm sector despite opposition calls for a levy on soybean exports.
""If we increase taxes, we can lose competitiveness and attractiveness to national and foreign capital,"" said Abdo. The 46-year-old former senator belongs to the Colorado party. He is facing opposition figure and lawyer Efraín Alegre in next month's vote.
There is no independent polling being done on the race. Abdo says his opinion polls show him 30 points ahead, while polls done by the opposition show a technical tie. 
Some analysts and opposition figures like Alegre say Paraguay's agricultural sector, which has helped boost the country's gross domestic product in recent decades, should increase its contribution to the treasury.
The country produced more than 10 million tonnes of soybean for the first time last year and supplies from the country are expected to continue growing.
Paraguay has also become a major international beef exporter.
Abdo said in an interview that Paraguay should keep borrowing in the international capital markets to fund road and port projects that are key to growth.
""Within the debt structure, we also want to raise the percentage of multilateral credits, look for a balance. But we will continue with issuing bonds,"" Abdo said.
The country issued a 30-year bond last week for $530 million at 5.6 percent.    
    Abdo's father was private secretary and an influential figure in the government of Alfredo Stroessner, who ruled the country with an iron hand for 35 years. Abdo's detractors call him ""a son of the dictatorship"".
He calls the epithet unfair, considering he himself had nothing to do with the government of Stroessner, who was ousted in 1989.
""They criticize me for a past that I had no responsibility for,"" he has said.
Paraguay's next president will take power in August for a five-year term. Current President Horacio Cartes is constitutionally barred from seeking re-election.

The self-declared ""professional revolutionary,"" whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, has spent close to quarter of a century behind bars in France since he was captured and spirited out of Sudan by French special forces in 1994.
He had already lost previous legal fights against two other convictions that also earned him life sentences, and this was his third and last appeal, although he had not been expected to succeed.
The latest trial was related to Carlos the Jackal's conviction last year for an attack in 1974 on a shop on Paris's Champs Elysee, the Drugstore Publicis, that killed two people and injured 36 others.
The court in Paris confirmed his life sentence after the case was heard by a special jury made up of professional magistrates. It ruled that all of the evidence from the investigation showed that he was ""the individual who had thrown that grenade.""
Now 68, Carlos the Jackal, who was born in Venezuela, is already serving two other life terms. One is for the murder of two French police officers and an informant in June 1975 and the other for attacks on trains, a railway station and a Paris street in 1982 and 1983 that killed 11 people and wounded about 150 others.
The nickname was given to him by the media after a reporter saw a copy of Frederick Forsyth's ""The Day of the Jackal"" at Ramirez’s London flat.
One of his two lawyers was his wife, Isabelle Coutant-Peyre, who married him after meeting him as defence attorney.

Two U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity and citing initial reports, said the aircraft was a HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopter and it crashed near al-Qaim, a town in Anbar province close to the Syrian border.
One of the officials said that fatalities were ""likely"" and so far there were no indications that the helicopter was brought down by hostile fire. 
In a statement, U.S. Central Command said a U.S. military aircraft carrying U.S. service members crashed in western Iraq.
""Rescue teams are responding to the scene of the downed aircraft at this time,"" the statement said. 
Further details of the incident were not yet known, but Central Command said an investigation will be launched to determine the cause of the crash.
The mayor of al-Qaim, Ahmed al-Mahlawi, also told Reuters there were seven people on board.
The United States acknowledges that it has about 5,200 troops in Iraq that are part of a coalition fighting Islamic State militants.
Late last year, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared final victory over Islamic State, three years after the militant group captured about a third of Iraq's territory.

1063,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 06:40PM ET</span>",U.S. envoy says he urged North Korea to release Americans before summit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The State Department's recently retired envoy for North Korea said on Thursday he has urged North Korea to send a positive signal by releasing three American prisoners before a possible summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
In an interview with CNN, Joseph Yun, who announced his retirement from the State Department in late February, said he also encouraged North Korean officials to respond to Trump's announcement that he will meet with Kim. No date or location for the talks has been announced, although they are expected to occur in late May.
Yun said he had delivered the message in talks with North Korean officials after Trump's announcement last week that he would be willing to meet face-to-face with Kim.
""I've talked to North Korea and I sent a single message to them, which was that this was an amazing opportunity for both sides and they need to respond,"" Yun told CNN.
""I pressed the point to them, this would be an incredibly good time for them to release those prisoners so that they can be reunited with their families. And that that in itself, I told them, would be a very positive message,"" he added.
South Korean-born Yun, a strong advocate for engagement with Pyongyang, led contact with North Korea and quietly pursued direct diplomacy since taking his post under former President Barack Obama in 2016.
The possibility of a summit has raised speculation it could lead to the release of the three Americans. They are: Kim Dong Chul, a Korean-American missionary; Kim Sang-duk, who spent a month teaching at the foreign-funded Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) before he was arrested in 2017; and Kim Hak Song, who also taught at PUST.
Yun said he hoped the summit would open the way to further talks on easing U.S. concerns over Pyongyang's nuclear programs.

""What I hope comes out of the summit is that President Trump and Kim Jong Un paint a broad-brush ... framework of where we need to go, and agree on some principles and agree to kick off a process,"" he said.

The judge's ruling came a day after Colombian police arrested Raul Gutierrez Sanchez, 45, whose mobile phone allegedly contained text messages with details of the planned attack. One text message said he might conduct a suicide attack, police said. 
""We cannot underestimate anything,"" national police general Jorge Hernando Nieto told journalists. ""All institutional capacities are there to counteract possible cells that are in Colombia."" 
Gutierrez was located with help from Spanish authorities, police said. 
“I’m not Muslim,” Gutierrez told local news media after leaving the hearing. “I fight against the new world order, especially against Americans.” 
The U.S embassy in Bogota told local media it was grateful for the work of the police and the attorney general and would continue cooperating with Colombia on the case.
Though Colombia has suffered a more than 50-year internal conflict that regularly included bombings, there is no history of Islamic militant attacks in the country.

1065,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 10:18PM ET</span>",Florida foot bridge collapse leaves four people dead,"By Zachary Fagenson
MIAMI (Reuters) - A newly erected pedestrian bridge spanning several lanes of traffic collapsed at Florida International University on Thursday, killing four people, Miami-Dade County Fire Chief Dave Downey said.
Emergency personnel with sniffer dogs searched for signs of life amid the wreckage of concrete slabs and twisted metal after the 950-ton bridge crushed vehicles on one of the busiest roads in South Florida. 
At least eight vehicles were trapped in the wreckage of the bridge and at least 10 people have been transported to hospitals, officials and doctors told news conferences. 
Witnesses told local media the vehicles were stopped at a traffic light when the bridge collapsed on top of them at around 1:30 p.m. ET (1730 GMT).
""We're working our way into the pile trying to create holes that we can actually physically see,"" Miami-Dade Fire Department Division Chief Paul Estopian told reporters. 
At one point, police requested television helicopters leave the area so rescuers could hear for any sounds of people crying for help from beneath the collapsed structure, CBS Miami television said.
Complicating the rescue effort was the uncertainty about the integrity of the bridge, parts of which remained off the ground, much of it inclined, local media reported.
The 174-feet (53-meter) long bridge connects the university with the city of Sweetwater and was installed on Saturday in six hours over the eight-lane highway, according to a report posted on the university's website.
""If anybody has done anything wrong, we will hold them accountable,"" said Florida Governor Rick Scott, at a Thursday night press conference, after his office issued statement saying a company contracted to inspect the bridge was not pre-qualified by the state.
The bridge was intended to provide a walkway over the busy street where an 18-year-old female FIU student from San Diego was killed while trying to cross last August, according to local media reports.
Students at FIU are currently on their spring break vacation, which runs from March 12 to March 17.
'A MIRACLE' 
Student Aura Martinez was having lunch in a nearby restaurant with her mother when a waitress told her the bridge had collapsed. She ran outside and helped pull a woman out of her car, most of which was flattened by the bridge. 
""Her car, it was literally a miracle of God, her car got squished by the bridge from the back, so she was able to get out and she was on the floor and it was just very traumatic,"" she told the local CBS affiliate.
To keep the inevitable disruption of traffic associated with bridge construction to a minimum, the 174-foot portion of the bridge was built adjacent to Southwest 8th Street using a method called Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC). It was driven into its perpendicular position across the road by a rig in only six hours on Saturday, according to a statement released by the university.
The $14.2 million bridge was designed to withstand a Category 5 hurricane, the most dangerous measure by the National Hurricane Center, and built to last 100 years, the university said. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending a team to investigate why it collapsed. President Donald Trump thanked first responders for their courage on Twitter. Along with Governor Scott, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio went to the scene of the collapse. Munilla Construction Management, which installed the bridge was founded in 1983 and owned by five brothers, according to its website. In addition to its Florida operations, the company also has divisions in Texas and Panama and employs 500 people. ""Munilla Construction Management is a family business and we are all devastated and doing everything we can to assist,"" the company said in a statement. FIGG Engineering said it took part in the bridge project and the collapse was a first in its 40-year history. Both companies said they would cooperate fully with investigators. Colorado-based engineering company BDI said in a tweet on March 12 that it was ""thrilled"" to have conducted structural monitoring during the ""spectacular"" process of moving the bridge into place. The company removed the tweet on Thursday and said in a statement it did so out of respect for individuals affected by the collapse. Scott's office said FIU picked a firm that was not pre-qualified to check the design of the bridge, which was required because it was such a long pedestrian bridge and other unique characteristics.  ""The firm selected, Louis Berger, was not FDOT pre-qualified for this service, which is required under FIU’s agreement with the state. FIU’s design build team is responsible for selecting a pre-qualified firm and ensuring this process is followed,"" the governor said in a statement. Officials at the Miami office of global engineering services firm Louis Berger were not immediately available for comment.

As a national debate about the response by law enforcement to the Feb. 14 rampage and random gun violence in America rages, the 27-minute video shows Broward County Deputy Sheriff Scot Peterson failing to enter Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School where he worked as an armed guard.
Peterson resigned on Feb. 22 rather than face suspension. Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has said Peterson stayed outside the high school during the attack, instead of going inside to confront the gunman.
""The video speaks for itself. His actions were enough to warrant an internal affairs investigation,"" the sheriff's office said in a statement accompanying the video's release following a judge's order on Monday.
The accused shooter, Nikolas Cruz, 19, faces a possible death penalty if convicted of 17 counts of first-degree murder and 17 counts of attempted murder. A judge entered a not-guilty plea for him at an arraignment on Wednesday.
The response by Peterson and the sheriff's office is under review by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. President Donald Trump has called Peterson a ""coward"" for not entering the building.
Peterson's attorney, Joseph DiRuzzo, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He has said Peterson remained outside because he thought the gunfire was occurring outside the school. 
The surveillance footage initially shows a uniformed officer and another man outside an arcaded part of the school. They then drive away in a golf cart.

Almost all of the footage shows dark figures occasionally moving outside the school's Building 12, often while obscured by shadows. Images of students who appear in the footage are pixelated.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May and British businesses are banking on European Union leaders granting a Brexit transition deal next week but diplomats said they could face disappointment unless a deadlock is broken over the Irish border.
May's spokesman said on Thursday she remained ""confident"" of a deal that would reassure investors that little will change in trading with the bloc for around two years after Britain leaves next March and until a new trade pact can be agreed.
EU diplomats and officials said talks have raised their hopes too that, with London anxious for a quick deal, the bloc's leaders can endorse a transition at a Brussels summit on Friday.
But what some described as complete stalemate on Irish border arrangements risks derailing any agreement. 
""This whole thing could end in tears,"" one senior diplomat said. ""British business might get a terrible shock.""
Asked about those concerns, a British government source conceded that there was still ""a lot left to do"".
The EU is irritated by Britain's refusal to accept in the draft withdrawal treaty the inclusion of a ""backstop"" solution to avoid a disruptive hard land border between EU member state Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland.
Sterling has suffered before when Brussels has warned that a transition deal cannot be taken for granted. It will not become certain until the whole withdrawal treaty is ratified, probably early next year, but Britain hopes for an interim EU commitment.
""No one will promise May a transition just like that,"" a second diplomat said after envoys from the 27 remaining states discussed EU negotiators' latest draft ""But there is something in the air, there is optimism. Cautious, but optimism. We want to use the fact that Britain wants the transition so much, we would hope many things will therefore move. We will stress the Irish issue."" LEVERAGE Another EU diplomat echoed that view, saying: ""There is a lot of movement. All the rest can be sorted out. But unless Ireland is sorted out, there is no transition deal at the summit."" Germany's Brexit coordinator said ""a lot of progress"" was being made. Some foresaw a possible ""fudge"" of the Irish issue, as happened to secure a first interim accord last December. Dublin insists London must accept the ""backstop"" which the EU says May agreed to as part of the interim deal in December. That would see the province effectively retained inside an EU-run customs area, isolated as result from the British mainland. May, who relies on Northern Irish votes in parliament, has rejected that and said better solutions will have to wait for separate talks on future UK-EU trade, due to start this spring. There has been progress this week in narrowing differences on such issues as expatriate citizens' rights, copyright and nuclear cooperation. But EU negotiators are reluctant to give away leverage they believe they need to cut a final deal. ""We won't just offer transition like that next week,"" a fourth EU diplomat said. ""We would lose a lot of leverage, risk Ireland. But the latest talks have covered ground. So we'd look for a wording to recognize that and lock that progress. ""To send a positive signal ahead. They will get it -- if they accept our conditions,"" the diplomat added. Negotiations are set for over the weekend and senior British representatives will be in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday.  May will attend the summit on Thursday, although Brexit will not be formally discussed. She may seek support against Russia over the nerve agent attack on a Russian former spy in Britain. 
Any Brexit transition deal will be discussed by the other 27 leaders when they reconvene without May the following day.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lankan officials said on Thursday they had lifted a ban on Facebook after discussions with the social network, a week after blocking access on the grounds it was being used to fuel communal violence.
At least two people were killed in clashes last week when Sinhalese Buddhists, angered by the killing of a Buddhist driver by Muslims, attacked mosques and Muslim-owned properties in the central Kandy district. 
Some of the violence was instigated by threatening posts on Facebook, according to the government, which cut access to Facebook, Viber and WhatsApp on March 7. It initially said the ban would last for three days but extended the block without informing the public, users said.
""On my instructions, my secretary has discussed with officials of Facebook, who have agreed that its platform will not be used for spreading hate speech and inciting violence,"" President Maithripala Sirisena said on his Twitter feed.
He said he had instructed the telecommunication regulator to remove the temporary ban with immediate effect.
Government officials have said Facebook's action against those who spread hate speech had been too slow. 
""Facebook officials agreed to speed up the response time,"" telecommunication minister Harin Fernando, who participated in the discussion with Facebook officials, told Reuters. 
""We have discussed how we can create new windows to make sure easy removal of these hate speech items,"" he said without elaborating. 
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) said in a statement to Reuters its officials met Sri Lankan government officials to outline the company's community standards and commitment to removing hate speech and incitement to violence from its platform.
""We have clear rules against such content, and will remove it when we're made aware of it. We are glad access to our services, and important connections for people and businesses, have been restored,"" the statement said.
The government lifted the ban on Viber and WhatsApp earlier this week.
Communal tensions have grown over the past year, with some hardline Buddhist groups accusing Muslims of forcing people to convert to Islam and vandalizing Buddhist archaeological sites. Muslim groups deny the allegations.
Fernando said on Tuesday the government could not control hate speech and fake messages on Facebook by ""extreme"" Buddhists and Muslims and it had become a menace to national security.
Police are investigating whether 10 suspected ringleaders of the wave of attacks on Muslims had outside funding or foreign help.

Sri Lanka's Muslims make up about 9 percent of its 21 million people and mostly live in the east and center of the island. Buddhist Sinhalese account for about 70 percent and ethnic Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, about 13 percent.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates (UAE) will train Somaliland security forces as part of a deal to establish a military base in the semi-autonomous region, Somaliland's president said on Thursday.
UAE government officials could not immediately be reached for comment - but the UAE has committed to invest hundreds of million dollars in recent years in the territory on a strategically important stretch of coastline on the Gulf of Aden.
The UAE began construction last year of a base on a site at the airport of the Somaliland port city Berbera, and will be allowed to maintain a presence for 30 years. Berbera is less than 300 km (190 miles) south of war-torn Yemen, where UAE troops are fighting rebels as part of a Saudi-backed coalition.
President Muse Bihi Abdi said the UAE would train police and military in Somaliland, which wants independence from war-torn Somalia but is not recognized internationally. He said he expected the agreement to be finalised within two months.
""They have the resources and the knowledge,"" Abdi told Reuters in an interview in Abu Dhabi.
UAE has become more assertive in its foreign policy in recent years. The UAE Armed Forces have been fighting in the Yemen conflict since 2015 and in the past deployed in international operations including Kosovo and Afghanistan.
Abdi said the military base, which he expects will be completed this year, will guarantee economic development and security for Somaliland and act as a deterrent to extremist groups in the region.
Somaliland's Foreign Minister, Saad Ali Shire, who was present during the interview, declined to disclose how many UAE soldiers would be stationed at the base.
""POLITICAL MISTAKE""
Several regional powers have set up military bases along the Horn of Africa coastline, including Turkey in Somalia's capital. The United States, China, Japan and France all have bases in neighboring Djibouti.
""It's safer to have a lot of military in the area,"" Abdi said.
Abdi said he hoped UAE investments, including a new civilian airport and a road connecting Berbera to landlocked Ethiopia, will lead to a ""huge creation of employment"" in Somaliland where unemployment is rampant.
""The biggest threat to Somaliland is poverty,"" he said.
Dubai's DP World is also developing Berbera port and building a free trade zone nearby.
This week, Somalia's parliament voted to ban DP World from the country, an act that it said had nullified the agreement.
Abdi said the vote was a ""joke"" and a ""political mistake"" that would have no impact on the DP World agreement that includes the government of Ethiopia.
Somaliland broke away from Somalia in 1991 and has acted as a de-facto state since then..

Abdi also said he expected the UAE would make a hard currency deposit into Somaliland's central bank but added that there had been no agreement between the two sides.

Mugabe, 94, ruled Zimbabwe from independence in 1980 until he stepped down under pressure from Mnangagwa's allies in the army in November.
Viewed by some as a liberation hero, others remember Mugabe for turning a promising country into an economic basket case and international pariah.

""I never thought he whom I had nurtured and brought into government and whose life I worked so hard in prison to save as he was threatened with hanging, that one day he would be the man who would turn against me,"" Mugabe said in the interview with South African state broadcaster SABC from Harare.
Mnangagwa was convicted of sabotage under white minority rule and sentenced to death. But he was spared the noose because it was deemed that he was a minor when he had committed the crime.
Mugabe said he was ousted in a ""military takeover"" and that Mnangagwa had assumed the presidency illegally.
""I don't hate Emmerson, I brought him into government. But he must be proper, he is improper where he is. Illegal,"" Mugabe said. ""We must undo this disgrace, which we have imposed on ourselves. We don't deserve it.""
Since his fall from power, Mugabe has stayed at his Harare mansion with his wife Grace. His ousting was the culmination of a power struggle between Mnangagwa and Grace Mugabe, who was being groomed by her husband as his potential successor.
Mugabe was granted immunity from prosecution and assured that his safety will be protected in his home country under a deal that led to his resignation.
Mugabe quit as parliament began a process to impeach him, triggering wild celebrations in the streets. 
Zimbabwe was once one of Africa's most promising economies but suffered decades of decline as Mugabe pursued policies that included the violent seizure of white-owned commercial farms and money-printing that led to hyperinflation.
Mnangagwa has said Zimbabwe still wants to end discrimination between black and white farmers but will seek new ways to compensate those who have lost their properties. Former colonial ruler Britain said last month that Harare should press on with transparent and fair land reform.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa demanded on Thursday that Australian interior minister Peter Dutton retract comments that suggested white farmers were being persecuted and deserved protection with special visas from a ""civilized country"".
Pretoria hauled in Canberra's High Commissioner for a diplomatic ticking off over Dutton's remarks, which also included a description of white farmers facing ""horrific circumstances"" - a characterization South Africa has rejected.
""The South African government is offended by the statements which have been attributed to the Australian Home Affairs Minister and a full retraction is expected,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.
Commenting this week on a documentary about violent rural crime in South Africa, Dutton said the farmers deserved ""special attention"", according to the Sydney Morning Herald and other Australian media.
""I do think, on the information that I've seen, people do need help and they need help from a civilized country like ours,"" Dutton said.
He also pointed to plans by new President Cyril Ramaphosa to allow expropriation of land as a solution to the massive land ownership inequalities that remain more than two decades after the end of apartheid.
Speaking to parliament this week, Ramaphosa said South Africa was not heading down the road toward the type of violent and chaotic seizure of white-owned farms that triggered economic collapse in Zimbabwe nearly 20 years ago.
""We cannot have a situation where we allow land grabs, because that is anarchy,"" Ramaphosa said. ""We cannot have a situation of anarchy when we have proper constitutional means through which we can work to give land to our people.""
Although violent crime is a serious issue across South Africa, killings on farms, the vast majority of which are white-owned, has become a particularly racially charged issue.
Afriforum, a rights group that mainly represents the views of the white Afrikaner minority, describes being a white farmer as one of the most dangerous jobs in the country, saying a white farmer is twice as likely to be murdered as a policemen, and four times as likely as a private citizen.
However, Gareth Newham, a crime expert at the Pretoria-based Institute for Security Studies, said the evidence was inconclusive, with murder rates for young black men in townships likely to be far higher that for white farmers.
The government denies that whites are deliberately targeted and says farm murders are part of South Africa's wider violent crime problem.

DAKAR (Reuters) - U.S. and Niger troops killed 11 Islamist militants from a Boko Haram splinter group in a firefight in December, the U.S. military said on Thursday, publicly acknowledging a previously unreported incident.
The fight took place two months after four American and four local soldiers were killed in Niger, and could prompt further questions about the extent of the little-reported U.S. mission in West Africa.
""During a mission in the Lake Chad Basin region the morning of Dec. 6, a combined force of Nigerien and U.S. military members came under fire from a formation of violent extremists,"" United States Africa Command (Africom) said in a statement.
""We assessed 11 enemy killed in action, including two wearing suicide vests, and one weapons cache destroyed during this mission,"" it said, adding that ""no U.S. or Nigerien forces were killed or wounded during the attack.""
Niger's defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A military source said the decision to issue the statement was taken after the New York Times learned the incident in an unclassified report the White House submitted to Congress this week.
The deaths of the four Americans in an ambush in Niger in October brought international and domestic attention to the U.S. mission to combat Islamist militants in the Sahel, the arid region south of the Sahara.
A regional branch of Islamic State claimed responsibility for that attack, which also led to a political fight between President Donald Trump and a congresswoman who accused him of speaking insensitively to the widow of one of those killed.
Southeastern Niger around Lake Chad, which borders Nigeria, Chad and Cameroon, is an area where militants from Boko Haram have been particularly active. The Islamist group has gradually split into two factions, one of which has pledged allegiance to Syria-based Islamic State. 
This faction does not have any known links to Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, the group on the western side of Niger that launched October's deadly ambush.
After the deaths of the Green Berets, the Pentagon was adamant that operation was not a kill-or-capture mission, but Nigerien officials insisted it was.
Anticipating similar questions about the December mission, Africom said: ""there was no aspect of this mission focused on pursuing enemy militants,"" adding: ""the purpose of this mission was to set the conditions for future partner-led operations against violent extremist organizations"".

The United States has 800 soldiers operating in the largely desert nation, more than France, which has 4,000 in the wider Sahel tackling the Islamist militancy.

ROME (Reuters) - Lebanon plans to increase its military presence along its southern border with Israel, Prime Minister Saad Hariri said on Thursday at a meeting in Rome, where he is seeking financial support for the armed forces.
Bolstering Lebanon's army and internal security forces is seen as a way for the international community to keep Hezbollah, which has helped sway the Syrian civil war in President Bashar al-Assad's favour, from broadening its clout in the Lebanese heartland.
Some 40 countries participated in the meeting, along with and United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres. While some financial aid was announced on Thursday, Hariri said that the goal of the meeting was not to gather pledges.
The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) took no part in the 2006 war between Israel and the Iranian-backed Lebanese Shi'ite Hezbollah militia. Since then, it has received more than $1.5 billion in U.S. military assistance and, in the last seven years, training and support from U.S. special forces.
""We will be sending more LAF troops to the south, and we stress our intention to deploy another regiment,"" he said, adding that Israel ""remains the primary threat to Lebanon"". 
""While we are thinking of ways to move from a state of cessation of hostilities to a state of permanent ceasefire, Israel continues to make plans to build walls on reservation areas along the blue line,"" Hariri said.
In a joint statement, the conference participants said Lebanon should ""accelerate effective and durable deployments to the South"".
The U.N. Security Council has allowed for 15,000 Lebanese troops to be deployed along the border since the end of the 2006 conflict. 
On Thursday, Hariri said he presented the five-year plans for Lebanon's military and security services to the participants, and each country would decide in the coming months how it could help.
The European Union pledged 50 million euros ($61.6 million)to Lebanon's security forces, and Hariri said France had created a 400-million-euro credit facility to purchase ""equipment"" for Lebanon's military and security forces. The UK has pledged an additional $13 million, it said on Twitter.
""I'm extremely satisfied with the outcome,"" Hariri said after the conference.
Hariri dismissed concerns that weapons intended for the Lebanese army would end up in the hands of Hezbollah, saying: ""We have never lost a weapon to anyone... and it will never happen in the future.""
On Thursday, Hariri reiterated his commitment to the policy of ""dissociation"", which is meant to keep the deeply fractured state out of regional conflicts such as the Syrian civil war.
Guterres told reporters: ""This is the moment in which the international community needs to express its full support (for Lebanon).""
Italian caretaker Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said Lebanon's stability was vital to region.
""Lebanon must be sheltered from the forces of destabilization,"" he said. ""Assuring Lebanon's stability assures the broader security of the Mediterranean and, as a consequence, of Europe.""
The Rome meeting is the first of three aimed at helping Lebanon stimulate its economy and weather the neighbouring civil war and attendant refugee crisis. 

In April, donors will meet in Paris, where Lebanon is seeking up to $16 billion in infrastructure investments. A meeting in Brussels follows, intended to help Lebanon cope with the more than 1 million Syrian refugees it is hosting.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's transitional justice tribunal - designed to try former leftist rebels and government soldiers for crimes during the country's five-decade war - will begin collecting evidence and preparing its first hearings, officials said on Thursday.
The Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) tribunal, founded under a 2016 peace deal between the government and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels, will try cases considered most representative of the war's violence.
""This is a historic moment that marks the starting point of what it means for a country like this to heal wounds through the recognition of truth and responsibility,"" JEP president Mirtha Patricia Linares told journalists.
More than 220,000 people were killed during the Andean country's long internal conflict between the government, leftist rebels, right-wing paramilitaries and drug traffickers. One Marxist guerrilla group remains active with myriad crime gangs.
Leaders of the FARC, now a political party, will be required to testify to the tribunals, recounting their part in killings, sexual violence, kidnappings, bombings and other crimes. If convicted, they may be ordered to complete five-to-eight-year sentences of restorative work like rebuilding roads or schools. 
Ex-fighters who lie or do not tell the whole truth but are later convicted could receive harsher sentences of between five and 20 years in regular prisons. Many Colombians believe the possible sentences are too lenient.
Some 7,000 FARC fighters demobilized early last year and more than 4,600 of them have already submitted testimony for the JEP to process.
Members of the armed forces who were involved in human rights violations will also appear before the JEP, which is set to operate for at least 15 years. Nearly 1,800 have submitted testimony.
Some FARC leaders expected to be called before the court are preparing to serve in 10 congressional seats reserved for the group through 2026, under terms of the accord. 
Victims' organizations are encouraged to present case evidence to the JEP, officials said. The court will also take over war-related cases from the country's regular judicial authorities. 
The conflict's complexity and length mean the tribunal will rule only on a small portion of crimes.
""Transitional justice, by definition, is modest, because we already know we can't do everything,"" tribunal administrator Nestor Raul Correa said. ""If I were to give a random figure - of 200,000 crimes that have happened in these fifty years, we'll investigate 1,000.""
A start date for the first trial has not yet been set.

The company and the directors were fined up to 750,000 euros ($925,275). The directors were also banned from executive roles at any shipping company for a year. They did escape the prison sentences prosecutors had asked for. 
The court said Seatrade had violated European Union rules by sending four ships to India for demolition in 2012. The ships ultimately ended up on beaches in India, Bangladesh and Turkey, where their dismantling polluted the environment and endangered the lives of the workers involved.
""It is common knowledge that beaching a ship and demolishing it at the spot pollutes water and air, while untrained workers lack the expertise to deal with dangerous materials"", the court said. ""These practices cause multiple deaths each year.""
With demolition as their only destination, the ships were waste from the moment they left port at Rotterdam and Hamburg, the judges concluded. Their journey thereby violated rules banning the transport of waste from the EU to India.
Hundreds of ships end up on the beaches of India and other countries in the region each year. They are demolished by untrained workers who have no way to safely deal with the toxic waste the ships contain, like bunker fuels, acids and asbestos.
Rules adopted by the EU in 2013 mandate that ships registered in the EU must be recycled through approved facilities. But the rules contain loopholes, and the South Asian yards continue to dismantle old ships. 
Activist group Shipbreaking Platform estimates 543 ships were broken down by hand on beaches in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh last year, amounting to 80 percent of all tonnage dismantled globally. 
Dutch affiliate North Sea Foundation welcomed the verdict.
""It makes sense and we are especially happy with the precedent it sets, not only in the Netherlands but the whole of Europe"", spokesman Merijn Hougee said.

The children helped lay 740 teddies on the steps of Berlin's Konzerthaus, each one representing 1,000 Syrian refugees denied an education, many of them living in camps near the Syrian border.
There are more than 2.5 million Syrian child refugees, about 740,000 of them of school age but with no access to education, charity World Vision Germany said. The war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and uprooted 11 million. 
""I have donated some of my old toys to a refugee camp near us,"" said Fee Muehlemann, an 11-year-old girl wrapped in a scarf and hat against the cold as she added teddies to the pile.
""You can help them by treating them normally, introducing them to daily life and giving the children of school age an education,"" she said.
Hussam Alheraky, an 18-year-old Syrian refugee, said: ""It's the seventh anniversary of the revolution. This means something big: that the world didn't do anything. The world has no conscience."" 
Alheraky fled first to Jordan after his school was struck by missiles during his final exams.
After arriving in Germany in late 2016 and learning the language, he won a place in a selective high school in Stuttgart, but remains worried about the plight of those he left behind.

""There are people who are having children there. They are getting married and having children, there at the border,"" he said. ""Of course those generations cannot write their own names.""

Colombian authorities have long grappled with the presence of foreign criminal groups like Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, which buy Colombian cocaine from local gangs and ship it north to the United States and Europe.
""It has been clearly identified by the attorney general's office, and we've informed the national government, of a growing presence of Mexican cartels,"" attorney general Nestor Humberto Martinez told journalists. ""We have to banish them because they are a threat to national security.""
Colombia, one of the world's top cocaine producers, has the capacity to produce an estimated 910 tonnes annually. In 2017 authorities confiscated a record 435 tonnes.
The Sinaloa cartel is allied with a 300-member group of dissident former members of the FARC guerrillas, who demobilized last year under a peace deal with the government, Martinez said.
The dissidents are operating near the country's border with Ecuador, an area well known for cocaine output, and the government is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the capture of the their leader.

PORT LOUIS (Reuters) - Mauritian Prime Minister said on Thursday it is deplorable that the country's ceremonial president has failed to follow through on an agreement to resign over a scandal triggered by accusations of financial misconduct.
The country's leader Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth said that under his agreement with President Ameenah Gurib-Fakim who is the first woman in the post she was due to step down on Thursday.
Last month the local L'Express newspaper said Gurib-Fakim used a credit card issued by an international non-governmental organization to buy clothes and jewelry in Italy and Dubai. The report triggered an outcry, not least on social media.
Gurib-Fakim has denied wrongdoing and said she refunded the money. On Wednesday she said she would not resign and was ready to testify in court to debunk the accusations.
Jugnauth said her decision is ""deplorable and unworthy"" and the cabinet would discuss the matter on Friday. 
""It undermines the presidency and does no credit to the Republic. It's a total disrespect towards the state and the Mauritian people,"" he said.
Mauritius markets itself as a bridge between Africa and Asia. Its economy relies on sugar, textiles and tourism but it is trying to develop new sectors like offshore banking, business outsourcing and luxury real estate.

The newspaper report said Gurib-Fakim used a credit card issued by the Planet Earth Institute, an organization which supports education by offering scholarships. She was an unpaid director at the NGO and the credit card was to pay for the promotion of a doctorate program named after her, it said.

Graffiti irony near Russian embassy tackles nerve attack,"LONDON (Reuters) - Opponents of President Vladimir Putin used graffiti on Thursday to take an ironic swipe at Russia over the nerve toxin attack on a former double agent.
Britain and Russia have been trading public insults over the use of a Soviet-era nerve agent called Novichok to strike down former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury.
""Dine at the Russian Embassy,"" read the white graffiti stenciled onto the pavement near the Russian embassy in London. ""Pasta Polonium / Sarin Spaghetti / & Novichokolate / Who knows what we Putin""
In response to the attack, Britain has given 23 Russians who it said were spies working under diplomatic cover at the London embassy a week to leave. Russia denies any role in the poisoning and has vowed to retaliate against Britain for the expulsions.
In 2006, green tea laced with radioactive polonium-210 was used to murder ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, a critic of the Kremlin, in London.

A British inquiry said Putin had probably approved the murder of Litvinenko, though Russia denied any involvement.

The May 6 election looks set to deepen the strong political influence already wielded in Lebanon by the heavily armed group, which is backed by Iran and listed as a terrorist organization by the United States.
Lebanon's first parliamentary vote since 2009 will be held according to a new law that is widely expected to yield fewer seats for the Future Movement led by Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, Lebanon's leading Sunni.
""Our ambition from these elections is not to increase the number of Hezbollah MPs. Our ambition is for there to be broader representation for our allies from different groups, sects and parties,"" Sheikh Naim Qassem told Reuters in an interview.
""This law will certainly increase the number of MPs of Hezbollah's allies,"" he said.
Qassem did not say how many seats he expected Hezbollah and its allies to win in parliament, where the 128 seats are divided among Lebanon's 17 officially recognized religious groups according to a strict quota.
Hezbollah, formed in 1982 by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, is the most powerful group in Lebanon and has moved beyond its borders to assume an important role as Iran's ally in conflicts in the region since 2012.
In the 2009 election, Hezbollah and its allies in the ""March 8"" alliance won fewer seats than Hariri's ""March 14"" alliance, which at the time was receiving strong financial backing from Saudi Arabia.
Since then, March 14 has largely disintegrated while Hezbollah and its allies have grown stronger, and Hariri's long-standing relationship with Saudi Arabia has become strained.
In 2016, Hezbollah ally Michel Aoun became head of state in a political deal that also made Hariri head of a government that spans nearly all of Lebanon's main political groups, including Hezbollah.
Last November, Saudi Arabia lost patience with Hariri's political accommodation with Hezbollah, forcing him to resign as prime minister and briefly putting him under house arrest in Riyadh, according to Lebanese officials.
Following a French intervention, Hariri returned to Lebanon and retracted the resignation after his government reiterated its policy of staying out of regional conflicts.
Qassem said he expected only minor changes in the composition of the next government, but it was too early to talk about who would be the next prime minister - a post reserved for a Sunni Muslim in the sectarian system.

""The change in the shape of the government and the way it is formed will be limited, but certainly it will be subjected to wider accountability by MPs because of the variety that will be in parliament,"" he said.

WASHINGTON/BELGRADE (Reuters) - The Pentagon on Thursday said ""misinformation"" led Serbia's defense minister to criticize a top U.S. general who had warned that Russia was meddling in the Balkan country's affairs. 
U.S. Army General Curtis Scaparrotti, the head of U.S. forces in Europe, said in Congressional testimony earlier this month that Serbia was vulnerable to Russian interference. 
Shortly afterwards, Serbian Defense Minister Aleksandar Vulin slammed Scaparotti, saying the U.S. general had accused Serbia of being a danger to the Balkans. 
""Since 1999 there was no harder, more irresponsible and more dangerous statement than Gen Scaparotti’s statement,” Vulin said. 
But on Thursday, the Pentagon said Vulin's comments were not based on accurate information. 
""Misinformation began to appear in Serbian media that attributed a false statement to General Scaparrotti designed to inflame Serbian sentiment against him, and by extension the United States,"" Pentagon spokesman Johnny Michael told Reuters. 
""Shortly thereafter, a senior Serbian official issued a statement based on that misinformation that mischaracterized General Scaparrotti's testimony,"" he added. 
An official from the U.S. military's European Command, speaking on the condition of anonymity, blamed Russia's Sputnik news website and other outlets for creating misinformation. The official said Russian influence has helped to amplify anti-American sentiments in Serbia. 
In his testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 8, Scaparrotti did not mention Serbia as a danger to the Balkans, according to a transcript of his remarks. 
But he was critical of Russia's role in Serbia, which has historical ties to Moscow despite current strong relations between the Serbian army and NATO.
""Russia's at work in the Balkans, and I think that we've kind of taken our eye off the area,"" Scaparrotti told the committee. 
NATO has accused Russia of escalating a disinformation campaign against the West since the Kremlin’s 2014 seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea region. U.S. officials say the Serbian incident shows that the United States is struggling to counter Russian disinformation.
A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the U.S. military was making a greater effort to be more pro-active in anticipating information that Russia could deliberately misconstrue. 
In 1995, NATO bombed Bosnian Serb forces and in 1999 the alliance also launched air strikes on the then Yugoslavia during the war in Kosovo. After the ouster of former strongman President Slobodan Milosevic in 2000, Serbia sought to mend ties with the West and wants to join the European Union.

The former army chief is widely expected to win by a huge margin in the March 26-28 vote, since his only challenger leads a party that supports the Egyptian president.
Neither candidate has done much campaigning, appealing instead for a high turnout to give the victor a strong mandate. Sisi won nearly 97 percent of the vote in 2014, but less than half of eligible Egyptians voted even though the election was extended to three days. 
""If (all Egyptians) vote and a third say 'No', that would be a lot better than if half that number turn out and all of them say 'Yes',"" Sisi said during a visit to the Interior Ministry.
Sisi also told a conference of military officers and relatives of soldiers killed in action that his first four years in office had brought stability and security after the tumult which followed the popular uprising of 2011.
""We achieved our promise and you have to achieve your promise. As we didn't abandon you, you should not abandon (us),"" Sisi said.
The ex-general overthrew Egypt's first democratically elected President Mohamed Mursi in 2013 after huge protests against Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood rule, before standing for election the following year.
""I think - and all Egyptians think - how hard and hopeless and really dark those days were,"" Sisi said, referring to the two years after the 2011 overthrow of veteran autocrat Hosni Mubarak. ""The state was lost, threatened by a great war.""
Sisi promised to work for stability and security when he assumed power, but has struggled to defeat an Islamic State insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula and contain other militant attacks across Egypt.
His supporters argue that the security situation now, although not completely secure, is better and more predictable than the unrest that rocked Egypt for years after the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011.
Last month the army began a major assault in Sinai and says it has killed scores of suspected militants and detained hundreds more in the region, the main stronghold of Islamic State after their defeat in Libya, Iraq and Syria.

In the past four months, the militants have carried out two spectacular assaults in Sinai - on an air base in December and at a mosque a month earlier, killing more than 300 people.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah does not expect its arch foe Israel to launch a war for now in Lebanon but is prepared for one, the deputy leader of the Iran-backed Shi'ite group told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.
As the war in Syria enters its eighth year, Sheikh Naim Qassem also said there was no end in sight to the conflict which would go on for at least two more years, and President Bashar al-Assad could not be forced out of an eventual settlement.
""There is no solution in Syria under the title of 'excluding President Assad'. On the contrary, the solution in Syria is with President Assad, and he is the mandatory channel for the solution,"" Qassem said.
The heavily armed Hezbollah joined the war in support of Assad in 2012, and has played a critical part in helping his government defeat Sunni rebels backed by the United States and its regional allies - Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey.
Hezbollah has spearheaded a coalition of Tehran-backed Shi'ite militias that have deployed to Syria from Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Iran's expanding power in Syria has caused deep alarm in neighboring enemy Israel.
Israel has mounted numerous air strikes in Syria against what it has described as Hezbollah and Iranian targets. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned last month that Israel would not allow Iran to put a ""noose of terror"" around its neck and it could act not just against Iran's proxies, but Iran itself. 
In Lebanon, where Israel and Hezbollah last fought a major war in 2006, Iran is helping the group build factories to manufacture precision-guided missiles or refit its longer-range missiles with precision guidance systems, Israeli and U.S. officials say. 
Asked about the Israeli accusations and warnings, Qassem said he would not comment on Hezbollah's military capabilities, deployments or plans.
""We don't talk about the military details, be it our capabilities or those of our allies, or our deployments, because they are secrets that we retain and we don't want to give a free gift to our enemy,"" he said.
Hezbollah ""is ready to confront the aggression if it happens, if Israel decides to carry out any foolish action"", he said. ""But it does not appear that the circumstances are for an Israeli decision for war.""
""We have declared repeatedly and frequently that we, as the resistance, work to have permanent readiness and we are ready to confront the Israeli aggression if it happens, and therefore we are ready to defend ourself by all available means.""
""We are working to fortify our front, and to be ready.""
HEZBOLLAH WILL STAY IN SYRIA AS LONG AS NECESSARY 
In Syria, however, he said it was possible Israel would conduct further ""limited"" attacks. ""The Syrian regime has taken the decision to respond to this type of attack,"" he added.
Syria's air defenses last month shot down an Israeli F-16 as it was returning from a bombing run in Syria after Israel said Iran had sent a drone into Israeli air space.
Working closely with the Russian air force and Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Hezbollah has helped turn the tide in the Syrian war which appeared to pose a threat to Assad's rule as recently as 2015.
The conflict passed its seventh anniversary on Thursday, having killed half a million people, driven out 5.8 million as refugees and uprooted millions more in the country.
Qassem said Hezbollah would stay in Syria as long as necessary. ""If we reach a political solution, of course Hezbollah will return to Lebanon.""
Assad and his allies had won the war by defeating what he described as a U.S.-led plot to destroy Syria, he added. ""Syria has won the military battle, which will help them to win the political battle,"" he said.
He added that Islamic State fighters who had sought to make Syria part of their ""caliphate"" had received a heavy blow and lost territories they held. 
While Assad's rule is no longer in danger, large areas of Syria remain outside his control at the borders with Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Israel. 
The United States has deployed forces into northern and eastern Syria where it is allied with Kurdish-led militia known as the Syrian Democratic Forces. Turkey has also sent forces into the northwest.
Qassem however did not expect the Syria war to lead to a direct confrontation between major powers.

""It is clear that all the parties and their allies view that it is in their interests not to have a direct confrontation between America and Russia, and they have rules of engagement that they have studied together and are abiding by,"" he said.

""We support the call for a full and complete disclosure by the Russian Federation,"" Bulgaria's envoy to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague, Krassimir Kostov, told members of the OPCW's executive council.
""We call on the Russian Federation to respond swiftly to the British government's legitimate questions and to co-operate with the OPCW,"" said Kostov, who made the comments on behalf of the EU.
The EU's appeal to Russia came after Britain, the United States, Germany and France jointly called on Russia to explain the military-grade nerve toxin attack in England which they said threatened Western security.
Former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia are in critical condition after being poisoned in the southern English city of Salisbury on March 4.
Britain has asked the OPCW to independently verify the findings of its bio-chemical weapons laboratory, Porton Down, that the nerve agent was the powerful Soviet-era toxin.

Russia declared roughly 40,000 tonnes of chemical weapons to the OPCW in the 1990s. The agency said in October that Moscow had completed destruction of the stockpile. It did not declare Novichok.

1087,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 03:32PM ET</span>","Rio de Janeiro councilwoman, critic of police killings, shot dead","By Brad Brooks
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A popular Rio de Janeiro city councilwoman who was an outspoken critic of police killings of poor residents in shantytowns was gunned down in what police, prosecutors and even drug gang leaders said on Thursday looked like a political assassination.
Marielle Franco, 38, a rising star in the Socialism and Liberty Party (PSOL), was killed along with her driver on Rio's dangerous north side around 9:30 p.m. Wednesday night. Her press secretary survived the shooting.
Just weeks ago, the federal government decreed that Brazil's Army would take over all security operations through the end of the year in Rio, where murders have risen sharply. Franco harshly criticized that move on Sunday, saying it could worsen police violence against residents.
""It is far too soon to say, but we are obviously looking at this as a murder in response to her political work, that is a main theory,"" said a Rio de Janeiro public prosecutor, who spoke on condition that he not be named as he was not authorized to discuss the case.
Rivaldo Barbosa, head of Rio's Civil Police, told reporters that ""one of the possibilities in analysis is, yes, an execution."" He did not speculate on who may have been responsible. 
An investigator with Rio's police force went further, saying the prime motive appeared to be Franco's calling out police for allegedly killing innocents in their constant battles with drug gangs.
Franco, who was raised and lived in the Mare complex of slums, long one of Rio's more dangerous areas, received over 46,500 votes in the 2016 election. That total was only bested by four of 51 council members. 
On Sunday on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Franco decried what she alleged to be the police killing of two boys during a police raid in an area called Acari.
""We must scream out so that all know what is happening in Acari right now. Rio's police are terrorizing and violating those who live in Acari,"" Franco wrote. ""This week two youth were killed and tossed into a ditch. Today, the police were in the street threatening those who live there. This has been going on forever and will only be worse with a military intervention.""
Calls to the police unit assigned to the Acari area were not returned. In a Sunday statement to the O Dia newspaper, police said they carried out an operation in the area, were fired upon by drug traffickers, returned fire but had no knowledge of any deaths.
Franco was raised and lived in Mare, a complex of slums where about 130,000 residents must contend with the presence of Rio's two most powerful gangs, the Red Command and the Pure Third Command. There are also militias often made up of off duty or retired police and firefighters, who are as feared as the gangs.
High-level members of both the Red Command and the Pure Third Command told Reuters their gangs had nothing to do with the killings. It was impossible to reach any militia members.
Raul Jungmann, who heads the federal government's newly created Public Security Ministry, said at an event in Sao Paulo that what Franco's killing was ""a tragedy.""
""Another lamentable daily tragedy that takes place in Rio de Janeiro. We must understand extremely well the reasons behind this and go after those responsible,"" he said. ""But this does not put at risk the federal intervention."" 
Jungmann said that federal investigators would be involved in the investigation and that he had put Brazil's federal police at the disposition of local investigators. 
Hundreds of mourners gathered outside Rio's city council building, where Franco's body briefly lay in state, while vigils and protests were planned in at least six other major cities across Brazil. About 150 members of the PSOL party carried flowers and signs into Brazil's federal Congress on Thursday demanding justice.

The United Nations office in Brazil and Amnesty International demanded a quick and transparent investigation into Franco's killing.

ADEN/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and its adversaries in Yemen's armed Houthi movement are holding secret talks to try to end a three-year-old war that has unleashed the world's worst humanitarian crisis, diplomats and Yemeni political sources said.
A Saudi-led coalition is fighting to counter the influence of Riyadh's arch-foe Iran, an ally of the Houthis, who deny any help from Tehran and say they are fighting a revolution against corrupt politicians and Gulf powers in thrall to the West.
Speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, two diplomats and two Yemeni officials said the Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdul-Salam had been in direct communication with Saudi officials in Oman on a comprehensive solution to the conflict.
""There are consultations between the Houthis and the Saudis, without a representative of the internationally recognized government, and it is clear that there is a desire of the Houthis and the coalition to go toward a comprehensive agreement,"" one diplomat told Reuters.
Neither Saudi nor Houthi officials provided an official comment.
Hailing from Yemen's Zaydi Shi'ite sect, the Houthis seized the capital Sanaa and drove the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into Saudi exile.
Fearing the advance was part of a regional power grab by Tehran, Riyadh and other mostly Sunni Muslim Gulf Arab states armed and supported by the United States and Britain intervened to restore his rule.
The hoped for accord would begin with a truce to pause fighting on nationwide battlefronts and culminate in the signing of a peace deal addressing the political interests of the warring parties, the sources added.
Thousands of Saudi-led air strikes have killed hundreds of Yemeni civilians while Houthi-led cross-border rocket attacks on Saudi Arabia have led to hundreds of casualties. Coalition forces have made modest territorial gains but appear far from seizing back the capital from seasoned Houthi fighters.
With no victory in sight, and as the war pushes the country toward famine, Saudi officials including the powerful Crown Prince and Defence Minister Mohammed bin Salman have expressed a desire to wrap up the conflict.
NEW ENVOY
Diplomats said the Saudi-Houthi dialogue had been going on for about two months and appeared aimed at providing a framework for a resolution to coincide with the arrival of a new U.N. envoy to Yemen, former British diplomat Martin Griffiths, who began his term on Sunday.
But it was not immediately clear how much progress has been achieved. U.N.-backed peace talks between the Houthis and the Yemeni government were last held in Kuwait in August 2016.
That round of dialogue and two previous ones in Switzerland, where there was no Saudi presence, ended without success.
The current talks appear to have bypassed Yemen's Riyadh-based government, whose restoration was the justification for the Saudi-led intervention, underlining a series of deepening Yemeni squabbles which have hobbled the coalition war effort.
Two Hadi government officials contacted by Reuters were unaware of the dialogue, and their criticism of the coalition has mounted in recent days, accusing them of barring Hadi and other Riyadh-based officials from returning to the country.
Hadi has mostly resided in Riyadh while government-held areas in Yemen suffered a series of deadly attacks by Islamic State militants. He last visited in February 2017.

DAKAR (Reuters) - Cameroon's octogenarian President Paul Biya, who has ruled the central African country with an iron grip for decades, held his first cabinet meeting since 2015 on Thursday.
A brief letter calling his council of ministers to the Unity Palace did not reveal the agenda. Prime Minister Philemon Yang read out a statement afterwards on state TV, saying Biya had insisted that they ""continue working"".
There was no explanation of why he had called the session and no other officials were permitted to speak about what went on in the conclave.
The president had told his cabinet that ""the best way to serve the country is to do everything, to make all the sacrifices that are needed,"" the prime minister said. 
""There are a lot of things to do,"" Biya had added, singling out the Africa Cup of Nations annual soccer tournament that Cameroon is to host next year, and the presidential election in October this year.
Minutes are never published, but if past cabinet meetings - often two or three years apart - are anything to go by, there would have been just one man talking. One in 2011 lasted ten minutes during which Biya entered, read out a speech, then left. 
Biya has ruled virtually by decree since taking over from a retired predecessor in 1982 and then winning an election by 99.98 percent a year later.
The meeting came as Cameroon faces a violent separatist movement in its western Anglophone region that a military crackdown has failed to quell. The rest of Cameroon speaks French.
In an apparent attempt to smooth it over, Biya appointed two officials from the region to top positions earlier this month. 
The economy has been sluggish because of low prices for its main exports oil and cocoa, and falling crude oil production. It was not by helped a shutdown in the economy of its restive Western region, which before the first crackdown in 2016 was becoming an unlikely hub for start-up tech firms.
Cameroon currently ranks 153rd on the U.N. Human Development Index, and average life expectancy is 56.
At the last council in October 2015, shortly after a sweeping reshuffle, Biya was similarly pre-occupied by sport, according to local press reports. He ordered ministers to ""accelerate preparations for the important sports celebrations"" that Cameroon was to host, namely the men's African Cup of Nations match next year and women's one that was held in 2016.

Outside of such meetings, Biya often meets his ministers at the airport between private trips abroad with his wife Chantal, famed locally for her luxurious dresses and bouffant hairdo. Their favorite destination is Switzerland.

The text, which includes both the terms of the divorce as well as of the two-year transition period that is to follow, has now been sent to London for further negotiations.
An EU official said the updated text contained legal clarifications, but no major or meaningful changes compared to the text published at the end of February.
(Full text: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/negotiation-agreements-atom-energy-15mar_en.pdf)
European Union leaders will discuss progress in negotiations on the withdrawal treaty with Britain at a summit on March 23 and are to approve guidelines for the Commission on negotiations about a future relationship, after the transition period ends.
One of the key unresolved issues in the draft treaty is how to avoid establishing a physical border between the Republic of Ireland and the British region of Northern Ireland after Brexit.
Another is the issue of the rights of citizens arriving in Britain after March 29th, 2019 but before the end of the transition period which is set at Dec 31st, 2020. 
The EU wants all such arrivals and their families to get the same rights as those who were in Britain before Brexit. London is willing to grant such rights to EU citizens, but not their families.
The final sticking point is the end-date for the transition period itself. The EU insists it needs a concrete date and that the end of 2020 is in line with Britain's own wish to have a transition of ""around two years"".

But talks on a future trade agreement that would regulate business between Britain and the EU after the transition is over could take much longer than two years and London would like the treaty to make provisions for that.

The non-binding motion also urges Turkey to remove its troops from Afrin, where Ankara is targeting the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia in an offensive launched nearly two months ago.
The Parliament's motion stressed ""the need to focus on defeating the U.N.-listed terrorist organizations"", a reference to Islamic State and other militant Islamist groups operating in Syria.
Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist organization that is a Syrian extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade against the Turkish state. The PKK is deemed a terrorist organization by the European Union and the United States as well as by Turkey.
""The latest decision is the most visionless decision the European Parliament has taken in recent years... Calling on Turkey to withdraw its troops is a clear support for terrorist organizations,"" Turkey's minister for EU affairs, Omer Celik, told reporters.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan also dismissed the motion.
""Don't get your hopes up, we will not leave there until the job is done. The European Parliament has nothing to say to Turkey and whatever it has to say on this issue will go through one ear and out the other,"" he said.
Erdogan is due to meet senior European Union officials later this month in neighboring Bulgaria, which holds the bloc's rotating presidency, to discuss EU-Turkey relations as well as regional and international issues.
Ties between Ankara and the EU have gone from bad to worse since a failed 2016 coup in Turkey. The EU has infuriated Erdogan by criticizing the scale of his crackdown on suspected supporters of the coup.
But the EU also depends on Turkey, which has NATO's second-biggest army, for support in the security field and for helping to restrict the westward flow of migrants from the Middle East.

The EU's top migration official, Dimitris Avramopoulos, said on Wednesday the bloc would chip in another three billion euros ($3.7 billion) for Syrian refugees living in Turkey.

1094,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 12:17PM ET</span>","U.S. hits Russians with sanctions for election meddling, cyber attacks","By Steve Holland and Doina Chiacu
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday took its most notable action against Russia since Donald Trump became president, slapping sanctions on a group of Russian individuals and entities, including Moscow's intelligence services, for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and malicious cyber attacks.
Under pressure to act, the administration still deferred making a move targeting Russian government officials and oligarchs, those closest to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Thursday's announcement marked the first time that the U.S. government stated publicly that Russia had attempted to break into the American energy grid, which U.S. security officials have longed warned may be vulnerable to debilitating cyber attacks from hostile adversaries.
Trump has faced fierce criticism in the United States for doing too little to punish Russia for the election meddling and other actions, and a special counsel is looking into whether Trump's campaign colluded with the Russians, an allegation the president denies.
Combined with the United States joining Britain in blaming Moscow for poisoning a former Russian spy in southern England, the actions represented another plunge in U.S.-Russian relations despite Trump's stated desire for improved ties.
""The administration is confronting and countering malign Russian cyber activity, including their attempted interference in U.S. elections, destructive cyber-attacks, and intrusions targeting critical infrastructure,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in announcing the new sanctions.
Trump has frequently questioned a January 2017 finding by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 campaign using hacking and propaganda in an effort eventually aimed at tilting the race in Trump's favor. Russia denies interfering in the election. 
But Mnuchin was unequivocal in saying that Thursday's Treasury action ""counters Russia's continuing destabilizing activities, ranging from interference in the 2016 election to conducting destructive cyber-attacks.""
A senior administration official told Reuters that Trump, who campaigned on warmer ties with Putin, has grown exasperated with Russian activity.
The Treasury Department aimed the sanctions at 19 Russian individuals and five groups. Sixteen of the Russian individuals and entities sanctioned were indicted on Feb. 16 as part of Mueller's criminal investigation. While Trump has frequently called the Russia probe a ""witch hunt,"" the new sanctions appear to affirm Mueller's investigative strategy. 
Trump told reporters during a White House event with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar that ""it certainly looks like the Russians were behind"" the use of a nerve agent to attack Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent in England. Trump called it ""something that should never, ever happen, and we're taking it very seriously, as I think are many others.""
Russian government hackers since at least March 2016 ""have also targeted U.S. government entities and multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing sectors,"" a Treasury Department statement said.
A senior administration told reporters on a conference call that Russian actors infiltrated parts of the U.S. energy sector.
""We were able to identify where they were located within those business systems and remove them from those business systems,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
'DESTABILIZING ACTIVITIES'
Mnuchin said there would be additional sanctions against Russian government officials and oligarchs ""for their destabilizing activities."" Mnuchin did not give a time frame for those sanctions, which he said would sever the individuals' access to the U.S. financial system. 
The new sanctions also include Russian intelligence services, the Federal Security Service (FSB) and Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), and six individuals working on behalf of the GRU.
Thursday's action blocks all property of those targeted that is subject to U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits American citizens from engaging in transactions with them. 
The Treasury Department said the sanctions were also meant to counter destructive cyber attacks including the NotPetya attack that cost billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia and the United States. The United States and Britain last month attributed that attack to the Russian military.
Mueller's indictment stated that Russians adopted false online personas to push divisive messages, traveled to the United States to collect intelligence and staged political rallies while posing as Americans.
Both Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Congress, which nearly unanimously passed a new sanctions bill against Russia last summer, had criticized Trump for not punishing Moscow. The Trump administration in January did not announce sanctions against Russia, for now, under the new law.
Republican Ed Royce, chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, welcomed the new sanctions as an important step. ""But more must be done,"" Royce said in a statement, promising that his committee would ""keep pushing to counter Russian aggression.""

The Treasury Department said it would keep pressure on Russia for its ongoing efforts to destabilize Ukraine and occupy the Crimea region, as well as corruption and human rights abuses.

1095,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 10:31AM ET</span>","Ahead of polls, Malaysia's Najib gives cash to staff of state-linked firm","KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Prime Minister Najib Razak on Thursday announced cash handouts on top of bonuses already paid to staff of Malaysia's largest government-linked asset management firm, as he prepares for a general election that must be held by August.
The scandal-plagued prime minister needs to consolidate support for his coalition from its traditional vote base of civil servants and the majority Malay-Muslims, to stave off an unprecedented challenge from his former mentor turned opposition leader, Mahathir Mohamad.
Najib said each of the more than 1,500 staff of Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB), which oversees assets worth about 279 billion ringgit ($71 billion), will get a payment of 2,000 ringgit, in conjunction with the firm's 40th anniversary.
""The ex-gratia (payment) will be made in May this year, so you can celebrate Aidilfitri with joy,"" he said to thunderous applause at the firm's anniversary celebration.
Malaysia's Muslims will celebrate the holiday of Aidilfitri, or Eid, in mid-June, ending the holy fasting month of Ramadan.
The announcement is Najib's latest effort to win over voters as he faces down financial scandals at a state fund and a government palm oil agency.
Mahathir, who led the country from 1981 to 2003, turned on his former protege more than two years ago, after news broke of a multi-billion dollar scandal involving state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
Najib and the fund have denied any wrongdoing.
The prime minister also faces the prospect of losing support from palm oil plantation smallholders operating under state-owned palm oil agency Felda, which has been hit by financial scandals of its own.
In July, Najib offered hundreds of millions of dollars in cash handouts and debt waivers in a bid to win over the agency's more than 600,000 smallholders, a key vote bank for his ruling party.
In October, Najib unveiled a national budget that promised to cut personal income tax for lower-income earners, hand out more to pensioners and spend billions on schools, hospitals and rural services to allay voters' worries.
Earlier, he announced aid running into billions of dollars directed at the mainly Muslim ethnic Malay majority in a bid to neutralize Mahathir's influence.

Mahathir has repeatedly criticized Najib's populist policies, denigrating them as ""livestock feed"" aimed at covering up the prime minister's scandals.

1097,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 11:14AM ET</span>",Special Report: How Europe's taxpayers will bankroll Viktor Orban's friends and family,"By Marton Dunai
KESZTHELY, Hungary (Reuters) - In a corner of Lake Balaton, central Europe's largest body of freshwater, the rocky shoreline leads to a leafy park at the city of Keszthely, a resort whose natural beauty contrasts with the dereliction of its hotels.
Keszthely used to be a magnet for Communist-era workers and apparatchiks before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Now, to the delight of many locals, the dilapidated waterfront is set for an investment bonanza. But the scheme is controversial. The reason: the people who stand to profit from it. In Keszthely, Reuters has found, those first in line to capitalize are Prime Minister Viktor Orban's friends and family.
Orban has earmarked more than $3 billion in public funds for tourism ventures across Hungary up to 2030, including more than $1.4 billion for Balaton, according to government announcements since March 2014. Most of the cash will come from Hungarian taxpayers. About 40 percent of the money for Balaton will come from the European Union, which gives funds to members to help lagging regions grow.
""This kind of money has not come to Balaton in all the years since the end of Communism combined,"" said Henrik Hoffmann, chairman of a Balaton regional tourism association.
Since 2014, when the prime minister first mooted the prospect of investment, the seven most prominent waterfront properties in Keszthely have changed hands. An analysis of publicly available data shows three of them are now owned by Orban's childhood friend Lorinc Meszaros and his business partners, and another three by Orban's son-in-law Istvan Tiborcz and his associates. Reuters has also found company documents that show a company co-owned by Orban's son-in-law Tiborcz stands to collect almost half of any profits from a venture which acquired the resort's biggest hotel.
Neither Tiborcz or Meszaros responded to requests for comment. 
Meszaros and Tiborcz are part of a Hungarian elite which has grown fast over the past eight years, acquiring stakes in major industries like banking, energy, construction, agriculture and the media, as well as tourism. In all, 10 individuals have significant stakes in the Keszthely developments. Most of them have become heavyweights in the broad economy: Companies they control have participated in winning bids for public procurement contracts, some of them funded by the EU, worth nearly $8 billion since Orban resumed power in 2010, according to a Reuters analysis of data collected by the Corruption Research Centre Budapest, a think tank, from the Public Procurement Authority. 
That is more than 10 percent of the value of such contracts over that time. Last year was a bumper one for public procurement tenders: More than $14 billion were awarded, and companies controlled by men with interests on the Keszthely waterfront won just over $4 billion of them - more than one dollar in every four. 
Neither Orban or the government responded to requests for comment.
The European Union's anti-fraud office (Office européen de lutte antifraude or OLAF), has recommended that Brussels ask Hungary to repay EU funds totaling more than 4 percent of the cash Europe has given it between 2012 and 2015. OLAF declined to discuss specific projects, but says on its website it makes such recommendations when it believes EU money has been ""defrauded or irregularly misspent."" Suspected violations can include projects that have been overpriced, involved collusion with bidders, or pointed to conflicts of interest. Hungary's suspect total, according to OLAF's 2016 annual report, is a bigger share than that of any other EU state, amounting to about 850 million euros ($1 billion) of funds.
In January, OLAF recommended that Hungary take legal action over what it called ""serious irregularities"" in the award of contracts to Tiborcz and an associate, Endre Hamar, for a street lighting project. In that project, a company owned by Hamar was the adviser on tenders that another Tiborcz and Hamar firm went on to win. Neither man has commented on OLAF's findings. 
OLAF has no power to police member states, and can only recommend steps for the European Union or national authorities to take. The EU has ""zero tolerance to fraud with EU funds and therefore insists on a clear commitment from all member states to prevent fraud,"" a Commission spokesperson said by email. The spokesperson did not respond directly to Reuters findings, or say what if any funds have been recovered from Hungary. The European Commission also carries out its own audits, blocks payments when it suspects an irregularity and claws back the expenditure if the irregularity is confirmed. But this work is not made public.
Orban's party, Fidesz, has ruled Keszthely for more than a decade, and polls show he is set for victory in a national election this April. He has long defied oversight by what he calls the ""global political overlords"" and ""liberal elites"" and portrays himself as a pioneer among eastern European leaders whose countries are part of the European Union, but who rebel - in his case by saying Hungary deserves the bloc's cash in exchange for opening up its markets, and that he should be free to form his own class of loyal industrialists.
""What some call corruption is essentially the main policy of Fidesz,"" Andras Lanczi, an Orban supporter at the think tank Szazadveg, said in a 2015 newspaper interview that Szazadveg put up on its website. ""By that I mean the government has set goals like forming a layer of domestic businessmen, building pillars of a strong Hungary in rural areas or in industry.""
Orban and his associates have a clear system, said Peter Kreko, chief analyst at the Political Capital think tank in Budapest: They build positions in sectors and prepare for the arrival of public funds. ""Close associates of the prime minister get fat on state money,"" he said.
""NATIONAL COOPERATION""
Outside Hungary, Orban, the country's longest-serving leader since Communist times, makes headlines for what he rejects. He helped banish Communism, but he also went on to flout European policy by refusing to house refugees. He cut short cooperation with the International Monetary Fund and boosted taxes on foreign banks and multinational corporations.
Less widely known is that eight years ago, he introduced an economic doctrine which he called a revolt against international capital and liberal values. It is geared to affirming the supremacy of nationalist-minded people, a vogue that has spread across eastern Europe.
""We were among the first, or maybe the first, to revolt in 2010,"" Orban said in his state of the nation address last year. ""In seven years of hard work we built our own political and economic system, a Hungarian model tailor made for us... the System of National Cooperation."" He told a gathering of friendly intellectuals in 2013 that this involves nurturing a supportive moneyed class: ""The system cannot work without international capital. But... Hungarian national capital must be empowered as well.""
Since 2010, Hungary's economy has grown by about 2 percent a year on average and tourism in Balaton has grown even faster. But Keszthely's tally of 165,000 overnight stays in 2014 slipped to about 135,000 per year, on average, in 2015 and 2016, according to Hungary's Central Statistics Office.
The month before Hungary's 2014 election, Orban attended a conference of tourism professionals in another town on the Balaton shore. He told them the government had a plan, based on ""sketches on the canvas,"" to inject development funds totaling about $1.1 billion in tourism - plus extra funds for Balaton. He did not say then where the money would come from.
WESTERN HARBOR
That June, after Orban had been re-elected, his daughter Rahel's husband, Istvan Tiborcz, set up a company, Western Basin Harbor Development, with partners including Tiborcz's old school friend Hamar, who is a lawyer. It went on to acquire the rights to the Keszthely Yacht Club from the city.
The agreement, sealed in December 2014, divided the sale into three parts and included an option rather than a cash sale. This structure meant that even though the arrangement obliged the buyer to pay more than $1 million for the buildings, each element of the deal's value was below the $100,000 threshold that would require the contract be put out to tender.
There was a flurry of controversy with headlines such as ""Tiborcz buys marina for Christmas"" in the press. But after an investigation, the regional prosecutor said there was nothing illegal about the arrangement.
""We sold an unprofitable harbor at a decent price,"" said Keszthely's former deputy mayor, Robert Palinkas, rejecting any suggestion of wrongdoing. ""This was not an area that was marketable immediately and unconditionally. Maybe there were no other investors because they had to commit to serious undertakings there.""
Tiborcz quit as a partner in the Yacht Club in March 2015. The marina's main owner, Krisztian Lukacs, told Reuters this was a response to the controversy about his purchase. Tiborcz did not respond.
An old friend of Tiborcz stayed as CEO at the club. Zsolt Peter, who has lived in Keszthely since 2000, said his family had been close to the Tiborczs for three generations. The new owners gave the marina a facelift, installed a chic new restaurant and worked on marketing. Peter said that at the close of season last year, 130 boats moored there - up from 67 when he took over and just shy of breakeven, which he put at 150 boats.
But Tiborcz's interest in Keszthely did not end when he quit the Yacht Club. By far the biggest hotel on the waterfront, and the one in the best condition, is the boxy concrete structure of the Hotel Helikon, recently closed down for redevelopment. Behind the Helikon's grimy windows on a January visit, a billiard table stood with a lone cue propped up against it.
The site was bought in December 2016 by a new company called Pannon Tessera Hospitalis, or PTH. In its first year, PTH was owned and operated by a veteran hotel manager called Zoltan Somlyai. It had zero revenue and he said he was its only employee. Company documents showed 90 percent of profits were to be paid to an undisclosed holder of preference shares. 
According to fresh company documents filed last month, a company owned by Tiborcz and Hamar owns preference shares in PTH. These entitle the holder to 45 percent of any profits it makes. The rest of the profit now goes to a Tiborcz associate called Attila Paar, who bought a stake last year through a company he owns, and a another investor, a lawyer who is largely unknown in the tourism industry.
Tiborcz, Hamar and Paar did not respond to requests for comment. 
On a windswept weekday in late January, 70-year-old Gyorgy Horvath, fishing on the refurbished marina jetty, said he was more than happy with the plans to revamp the waterfront. He served at tables for 35 years as a waiter in the Helikon: He remembered when busloads of visitors came, in winter and in summer, year after year.
""Keszthely has great potential,"" Horvath said. ""I really don't care who builds stuff, and I don't care about politics. ... Just start something worthwhile already.""
""FLOWERS FOR HUNGARY""
Back in 2015, Orban's ""sketches on the canvas"" were still vague. There was, say people involved in Hungary's tourism industry, confusion over what to expect from the government, either in the marketing strategy or the funding. The government launched one plan in November but withdrew it six months later.
In April 2016, the government centralized the administration of Hungary's tourism industry in the Hungarian Tourism Agency (MTU). This entity, it said in a decree last March, designs and implements tourism programs, including those to be funded by EU money from 2014 to 2020. The MTU does everything from outlining strategy and assigning state funding down to organizing events such as the ""Flowers for Hungary"" program, a contest for the prettiest environment.
Orban's ministerial office took a similar centralizing step in 2014 when it absorbed the National Development Agency, which allocates EU funding in Hungary.
Orban's daughter, Rahel, played a role in the changes, such as formulating the tourism marketing strategy. Then 27, she had studied tourism and graduated with an Executive MBA in hospitality management at the private Ecole Hotelière de Lausanne in Switzerland, which educates some of the best tourism managers in the world.
Eight current and former tourism and government insiders told Reuters that Rahel Orban is highly influential in the tourist trade and works closely with the MTU's CEO, Zoltan Guller. The MTU said Guller had ""occasionally sought Rahel Orban's opinion about shaping the Hungary brand,"" and that she is not paid for this work. 
When asked if she influences decisions on funding, it did not respond. She did not respond. 
GOLDEN TOUCH
Even before Rahel Orban had helped clarify Hungary's strategy, others in the prime minister's circle joined the Keszthely shopping spree. In April 2015, a businessman named Gellert Jaszai made a purchase that paved the way for Orban's childhood friend Lorinc Meszaros.
Jaszai bought into a small holding company called Konzum, a former retail chain operator that had sunk to a penny stock. A year later, Konzum bought a real estate fund that included two Keszthely hotels and the rights to a company which operates a lakeside campsite. In February 2017, Meszaros announced on the stock exchange that he had bought 19.6 percent of Konzum.
Meszaros acquired dozens of properties elsewhere around the lake, which he incorporated into Konzum. Jaszai said he had known Meszaros for a long time.
A pipe-fitter and mayor of Orban's hometown, Meszaros is one of Hungary's most influential businessmen, famed nationally for attributing his rise to ""God, good fortune, and Viktor Orban."" His interests span well over 100 companies in seven major industries from construction and real estate to energy, media, banking, finance, tourism, sports, and agriculture.
Today, Konzum is one of four publicly traded companies in which Meszaros and Jaszai hold stakes. Its shares rose 5,300 percent last year, in anticipation of business success in ventures from tourism to energy.
""It's difficult to put a ceiling on the valuation,"" wrote stock analyst Gellert Gaal from Concorde, a prominent Hungarian brokerage, in December - a view he said in March he still held. ""Investors have extreme faith in the profit growth of these companies, as if everything these companies touch turned into gold.""
In addition to renovated hotels, the Balaton area now is promised improved road, rail, air and water infrastructure, including a $670 million motorway, upgraded adventure parks, and a central state marketing effort around the Balaton brand.
Gyorgy Wossala, a 77-year-old Balaton hotel manager who sold a hotel up the lake to Meszaros in 2016, said he chose Meszaros from a half dozen competing bidders solely because Orban's old friend offered the best price. He would not say what it was.
""He probably sees the opportunity in Balaton,"" Wossala said, sucking on a pipe on the patio of his lakeside home. ""Everyone who can is building positions now,"" he added, referring to the government's planned cash injection in tourism.

""Everyone sees these billions. ... And of course, people with good government ties have always received their subsidy before those without.""

1098,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Hungary premier's friends and family win more and more public business,"By Marton Dunai
BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's friends and family have been increasingly successful in winning publicly funded business since he resumed power in 2010, a Reuters analysis of public procurement data shows.
Companies owned or controlled by 10 businessmen - including Orban's childhood friend Lorinc Meszaros and his business partners, and his son-in-law Istvan Tiborcz and his associates - have collectively secured 1.975 trillion forints ($7.85 billion) worth of tenders for contracts funded by public money since 2010, the analysis shows. 
That is more than 10 percent of the value of such contracts over the period. The total includes contracts awarded either directly or in consortia, and direct contracts as well as framework agreements.
The 10 men's share of the total surged last year, when public procurement in Hungary reached a record high of 3.63 trillion forints. In 2017, companies they controlled won business worth 28 percent of that, up from around 1-2 percent before Orban took power.
""Reuters' analysis uncovered new hard data and arrived at a valid summary, which contribute to this field in a relevant way,"" said Istvan Janos Toth, an economist with the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Toth is also director of the Corruption Research Centre Budapest (CRCB). The analysis used data collected by the CRCB from the Public Procurement Agency's website. 
Neither the government nor Orban responded to requests for comment. 
The 10 emerged during reporting for a special report from Lake Balaton, one of central Europe's top tourist destinations. After Orban announced major public funding for tourism projects in the region in 2014, the men bought into properties in the Balaton city of Keszthely. 
Orban's son-in-law Tiborcz was the first new investor. He pulled out of one property in 2015 after controversy around his purchase, but a company he co-owns now holds a stake in the resort's largest hotel. This company, Reuters found, is entitled to 45 percent of profits from the hotel and another in its portfolio.
He did not respond to a request for comment.
    
EUROPEAN FUNDS
Orban, whose party, Fidesz, faces elections on April 8, has made strengthening local businessmen a cornerstone of his economic policy. Polls show the premier, 54, is likely to secure a third straight term in office, although a united opposition has made his campaign less predictable.
The Balaton investment will include European Union funds. 
The EU has ""zero tolerance to fraud with EU funds and therefore insists on a clear commitment from all member states to prevent fraud,"" a Commission spokesperson said by email. The spokesperson did not respond directly to Reuters findings. 
In its 2016 annual report, the EU's anti-fraud office (Office européen de lutte antifraude or OLAF) recommended that Brussels ask Hungary to repay EU funds totaling more than 4 percent of the cash Europe has given it between 2012 and 2015, the highest rate of any EU member country by far.

OLAF declined to discuss specific projects, but says on its website it makes such recommendations when it believes EU money has been ""defrauded or irregularly misspent."" Suspected violations can include projects that have been overpriced, involved collusion with bidders, or pointed to conflicts of interest.

ROME (Reuters) - The United Nations agency that helps Palestinian refugees said on Thursday it had received new cash pledges to enable it to keep working for a few more months, but warned its long-term outlook remains in doubt.
The U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) is looking to cover an estimated $446 million budget shortfall that was largely caused by President Donald Trump's abrupt decision in January to effectively freeze U.S. aid to the Palestinians.
A donors' conference in Rome drew promises from countries around the world of additional funds of some $100 million, leaving UNWRA with a uphill task to keep its core education, healthcare and food security services afloat.
""A very important first stop was reached today, but a long way is in front of us,"" U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres told reporters after the meeting. 
""If UNWRA did not exist, if its services were not provided, the security of the region would be undermined,"" he added.
Washington donates about $350 million a year to UNRWA, which was founded in 1949 to aid Palestinian refugees, but so far this year has handed over $60 million. U.N. officials fear they might not receive any more from the United States in 2018.
Trump said in January the United States would only give aid if the Palestinians agreed to renew peace talks with Israel. The talks have been frozen since 2014, and with no negotiations in sight, envoys from around 70 countries and organizations met in Rome to discuss the funding crisis.
Going into the meeting, UNRWA Commissioner-General Pierre Krähenbühl had warned his organization would run out of funds in May. The new pledges gave the agency a bit more breathing room.
""It will last us a couple of months more into the middle or beginning of the summer,"" he said. ""We need to be optimistic.""
Among the countries that had offered more money were France, Qatar, Canada, Switzerland, Turkey, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Mexico, South Korea, Slovakia and India, he said, without giving any further details.
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS
UNRWA operates in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, in Gaza, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. It runs 710 schools, its doctors carry out a total 9 million consultancies a year and it feeds some 1.7 million people – mostly in the Gaza Strip.
Palestinians say funding cuts would especially impact Gaza, an impoverished, Islamist-ruled enclave blockaded by Israel and Egypt where half of its 2 million population rely on humanitarian aid and where the jobless rate is 46 percent.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has voiced measured support for the U.S. fund cut, but also appeared to acknowledge it could leave Israel - which maintains tight restrictions on the movement of people and goods across the Gaza border – facing a potential humanitarian crisis on its doorstep.
A diplomat in Rome, who declined to be named, warned that UNRWA’s woes could persuade hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to try to come to Europe, possibly exacerbating the EU immigration crisis.
The United States has traditionally provided around 30 percent of UNRWA’s funding, helping to cement Washington’s predominant role as the chief negotiator between the Palestinians and Israelis.
Since taking office last year, Trump has keenly embraced Israel, delighting Netanyahu by pledging to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, angering Palestinians who want to share the city with the Israelis as their future capital.
By contrast, in a tweet in January, Trump accused the Palestinians of showing ""no appreciation or respect"" and criticized them for shunning peace talks.

The Palestinians have said negotiations are pointless until Israel halts building Jewish settlements on occupied territory. Netanyahu has said talks should resume without preconditions.

The European Union's General Court in Luxembourg agreed with a complaint by the Italian government that it was immoral to trade on the name of a ""criminal organization"" whose ""activities breach the very values on which the EU is founded"".
The judgment, which can be appealed to the European Court of Justice, found that the EU Intellectual Property Office was right to accept Italy's demand in 2015 to cancel a 10-year-old trademark held by La Mafia Franchises of Madrid, which runs a national chain offering pizzas, pasta and other Italian cuisine.
Rejecting the company's arguments about alluding to ""The Godfather"" films, the judges said it was not right to grant legal protection to the slogan ""La Mafia se sienta a la mesa"" -- ""The Mafia's at the table"" in Spanish -- because it ""promoted"" an organization known for extortion, corruption and murder.
Italy, plagued by the Sicilian crime network for decades, had said the trademark was contrary to ""morality"". The court decision does not prevent the firm from using the slogan, but means it can't rely on trademark protection to stop others from using it without permission.

PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron is squaring off against rail unions with most voters on his side, a poll showed, as a labor force with a history of confrontation threatens open-ended strike action over his plan to modernize the state-run company.
On Wednesday his government backed a bill to fast-track through parliament the biggest shake-up of debt-ridden state-run operator SNCF since the railways were nationalized in 1930s, including ending the right to jobs for life and removing early retirement provisions.
The four main SNCF unions, whose protests over reform plans in 1995 forced a u-turn from then prime minister Alain Juppe from which he never recovered, will decide on Thursday whether to call nationwide rolling strikes.
Thursday Odoxa survey showed two in every three French believe that response is unjustified, pointing to broad public backing for Macron's ambitious shake-up.
In daring to reform the generous and costly working conditions of railworkers, Macron is treading where past French leaders have shied away.
The battle over the future of the SNCF is as much a test of the mettle of unions, who have seen their influence decline as public appetite for industrial action wanes, as for Macron's stomach for driving through his reform agenda.
The Odoxa poll showed respondents were less convinced than previously that any unrest could paralyze France as in the past.
In 1995, the more than three weeks of transport strikes spearheaded by the hard-left CGT enjoyed popular support and drew in stoppages in other industries.
The number of French worried about a similar outcome this time around fell to 49 percent from 64 percent in a poll two weeks ago.
""That would seem to suggest there is far greater demand for far-reaching reform,"" the Odoxa polling firm said, though it added: ""Beware. It doesn't mean blockages will not happen or that the government won't take a hit if the conflict and stoppages spread."" 
More worryingly for Macron, the Odoxa poll also showed voters' concerns over personal finances were rising despite a pick-up in the economy. Other surveys have also shown French people believe their purchasing power is being eroded, in particular pensioners. 

Pensioners are taking to the streets in several cities on Thursday to denounce the increase of some taxes by Macron, a former investment banker, who has also come under fire for scrapping a wealth tax and curbs on social housing aid.

They were the first officers to faces charges over what has become known as the ""Marikana massacre"" in which police opened fire on a group of people to disperse a wildcat strike, resulting in the deaths of 34 striking miners.
The total death toll from the violence, the bloodiest security incident in post-apartheid South Africa, was 44 with 10 people killed in clashes leading up to the shooting, including two police officers. 
The case was investigated by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID), a unit within the police force which investigates suspected law-breaking by officers.
The IPID's spokesman did not respond to a telephone request for comment. 
A separate judicial inquiry set up by former South African president Jacob Zuma largely laid the blame on the police for what it called ""ill-planned and poorly commanded operations"". 
South Africa's worst police killing since the end of apartheid sparked intense public and media criticism towards the police, mining companies, unions, the ruling African National Congress and Zuma himself.

1103,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>","European allies boost defense spending, most still miss NATO's U.S.-backed goal","By Robin Emmott
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO's European allies spent more on defense for the third year running in 2017 but their outlays failed to lift more countries above a target sought by the United States. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has demanded allies dedicate 2 percent of national economic output on defense every year and has sought to keep up the pressure by calling that target, agreed at a NATO summit in 2014, a ""bare minimum.""
NATO's 2017 annual report showed Estonia, Greece, Poland and Britain met the 2 percent goal, the same group as in 2016, although alliance officials say Latvia, Lithuania and Romania will join them in 2018. NATO has 29 member states in total.
Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, failing states on NATO's borders, and the spread of Islamist militancy have pushed European governments to focus more on boosting their home defenses after more than a decade of NATO-led operations in Afghanistan.
But the 2017 report may not be the breakthrough many NATO diplomats believe they need to mollify Trump, who as the alliance's de-facto leader has made defense spending a priority. He is expected to attend a summit at NATO headquarters in July.
In 2017, defense spending in Europe, including Turkey, rose 4.07 percent, or by $10.8 billion, compared to 2016, and marks a nearly $50-billion cumulative increase since spending began to increase in late-2014, the report said. 
Overall, the NATO European allies and Canada combined spent an average of 1.45 percent of their economic output on defense in 2017, compared to 3.57 percent in the United States. 
FEARS OF RUSSIA
After years of defense cuts following the Cold War, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the shift in spending marks a significant change, as the alliance seeks to deter Russia and undergoes its biggest modernization in decades.
""European allies and Canada are now stepping up,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference. ""After years of declines, we are seeing three consecutive years of increases and more countries will meet the 2 percent target,"" he said.
Large spending increases in Bulgaria, which fears Russian dominance in the Black Sea region, in Germany, which is leading a battalion of NATO troops in the Baltic, and in Norway, which borders Russia, helped the numbers last year compared to 2016.
Even Spain, which is not among the big-spending eastern European nations worried about Moscow, raised defense expenditure by 18.25 percent in 2017 after a sharp fall in 2016. 
But that spending did not keep pace with an economic recovery in Europe after years of crisis in the euro zone, and Spain remained well off the NATO target of reaching, or moving toward, 2 percent of gross domestic product by 2024.
Spending actually fell in Britain and Belgium, although in Britain's case the changes reflect fluctuations in the value of its pound currency, as the report is produced in U.S. dollars. 

As its biggest contributor, the United States, has warned European allies since the 2008/09 financial crisis that the alliance's military power and influence are at risk while countries such as China and Russia increase their budgets.

SALISBURY, England (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday visited Salisbury, the elegant English cathedral city which became the unlikely backdrop to a chemical attack against a Russian former double agent this month.
Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were found unconscious on a bench outside a shopping centre on March 4 after being exposed to what the British authorities have identified as a military-grade, Soviet era Novichok nerve agent. They remain critically ill in hospital.
May, who blames Russia for the attack and on Wednesday announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats, visited various locations in Salisbury including the area close to the bench where the Skripals were found.
""We do hold Russia culpable for this brazen and despicable act that's taken place on the streets of what is such a remarkable city where people come and visit and enjoy,"" she told reporters during her visit.
Moscow denies any involvement and has said May's accusations are ""insane"". The Russian government is expected to retaliate against the expulsion of the diplomats imminently.
May said her visit was to thank emergency and health services and reassure the public about their safety.
""It's been great to meet some tourists here in Salisbury, people coming to Salisbury, still enjoying this great city,"" she said.
Salisbury, dominated by its 13th Century cathedral with England's highest spire, has witnessed dramatic scenes since the Skripals were found. Police and soldiers in chemical suits and gas masks have been conducting forensic searches and removing vehicles from places visited by the pair.
Sergei Skripal, a former colonel in Russia's GRU military intelligence service, betrayed dozens of Russian spies to British intelligence before he was arrested in Moscow in 2004.
He was given a lengthy jail term in 2006 but was released four years later as part of a swap for 10 Russian spies caught in the United States.

Since arriving in Britain, he had lived modestly in Salisbury, keeping out of the spotlight until he was found unconscious, triggering a major diplomatic crisis between London and Moscow.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of supporters of Hungary's right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban marched on Thursday to back his bid for a third term in office in April elections, many of them hailing his hardline stance on immigration.
They were joined by thousands of supporters of Poland's ruling conservative PiS party - another administration on the EU's eastern edge at odds with Brussels over migration and efforts to tighten controls over courts and media.
Supporters of both parties braved the rain to walk across a bridge spanning the Danube river in Budapest carrying banners with the slogans ""Hungary protects Europe"" and ""We are with you Viktor"". 
""He (Viktor Orban) is not afraid of EU's big powers and dares to swim against the current,"" said Imre Csordas, 51, wearing traditional 16th-century Hungarian clothing. ""He stands up for the interest of Hungarians.""
Organizers had brought people in to the capital from the countryside in fleets of buses for the march that coincided with Hungary's national holiday commemorating its 1848 revolution. Orban was due to speak to the crowd in front of parliament.
Opposition and student groups were planning a series of counter-rallies during the day.
""THERE IS A LOT AT STAKE""
""Today, like so many times in our history, we again need to fight for our independence, for our nation, so Hungary can remain a Hungarian country and not be turned into a multicultural state,"" said the Civil Forum group, which organized the ""Peace March"", supported by Orban's Fidesz party.
""Luckily, for the time being, we do not need to fight with weapons ... but we must ...march and vote, as there is a lot at stake,"" Zsolt Bayer (DE:BAYGN), one of the founders of Fidesz, said in a video on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) calling on people to attend the rally.
Orban and Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki lead conservative governments under fire from Brussels over their refusal to take in migrants under a quota system.
Orban's stance has helped shore up support for Fidesz among voters but it has drawn accusations of racism from the United Nations human rights chief.
His party, in power since 2010, suffered an unexpected setback at a recent municipal by-election.

However, it remains well ahead of its rivals in opinion polls despite scandals around Fidesz and a recent investigation by the European Anti-Fraud Office which revealed ""serious irregularities"" in projects co-financed by the EU and run by a company once co-owned by Orban's son-in-law.

The club is under U.S. sanctions for its role in a pro-Russian separatist insurgency in Ukraine.
The Night Wolves announced the tour of Bosnia's autonomous Serb region as part of a swing through the Balkans under the slogan ""Russian Balkans"" but Bosnia's top security official said the visit was driven by political motives rather than tourism.
Security Minister Dragan Mektic told Reuters this week that Bosnian Serb leaders want to use the Night Wolves to intimidate opponents of the region's president, Milorad Dodik, and sway voters ahead of an election in October. 
Bosnia's security agencies banned club leader Alexander Zaldostanov, known by the nickname the Surgeon, and Sasa Savic, the leader of the club's branch in Serbia, the Sarajevo-based Dnevni Avaz daily reported. They were due to enter on March. 20.
""Both men are marked with an entrance ban in our data base,"" Dnevni Avaz quoted Zoran Galic, the director of Bosnia's Border police, as saying. Reuters could not immediately obtain comment from the agency or security ministry.
Dodik is also under U.S sanctions over an illegal referendum in the Serb region in 2016. He and other ethnic Serbs look to Russia rather than Western Europe because of a shared Orthodox religion and culture.
Russian volunteers fought on the Serbian side during a war in the Balkans in the 1990s. Sarajevo-based investigative magazine Zurnal reported that the Night Wolves are expected to meet Dodik during the visit.
Zurnal also said the Russian embassy helped organize the visit. The embassy in Sarajevo was not available for comment.
U.S. Ambassador Moreen Cormack, commenting on Wednesday on the Night Wolves for Bosnian state television, said political actors in Bosnia should maintain stability and security. 

The United States sanctioned the organization in 2014 for contributing to the detribalization of Ukraine, she said.

1111,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 09:59AM ET</span>",The lives of three men show why Syria’s rebels are losing,"By Dahlia Nehme
BEIRUT (Reuters) - The war has cost one man part of his liver and intestines. Another his home and work. A third his homeland and studies. 
All three have lost hope.
Abu Farhan, Fouad al-Ghraibi and Abu al-Baraa took the rebels' side in the violence which began after the government put down street protests that started on March 15, 2011.
Ghraibi, who has a business renting out construction machinery, joined a rebel group and later set up his own fighting unit. Abu al-Baraa, then just 16, joined a militant group, the Nusra Front, and became a jihadist fighter. Abu Farhan, a student and part-time kitchen fitter, joined the first protests in the central Syrian city of Homs and went on to became an opposition activist. 
The harrowing tales of the three men -- they don't know each other but all risked their lives by siding against President Bashar al-Assad -- help show why the rebellion is failing.
All three quickly became disillusioned with divisions among the rebels and what they saw as various fighting groups' intolerance of anyone who does not think like them -- a trait similar to what they see in Assad. 
Two of them have concluded the war is unwinnable, especially as Assad now has heavy military support from Russia and Iran that far outweighs the weapons shipped to rebels by the United States, Gulf Arab states and Turkey.
But hatred of Assad means fighters like Ghraibi battle on. Men such as Abu al-Baraa and Abu Farhan are so disillusioned with both sides that they see no life for them in Syria. 
""What happened destroyed my whole future,"" Abu al-Baraa, who now lives in exile in Turkey, told Reuters by telephone. He fled across the border after falling out with the Nusra Front, which he says imprisoned and tortured him. 
Ghraibi, 37, has recovered from abdomen and hand wounds and lost part of his liver and intestines, and a finger, says he will fight to the death with the rebels but also believes the rebellion's original ideals are dead.
""We'll keep fighting to our last breath, even against the whole world,"" he said.
OPPOSITION ACTIVIST
Abu Farhan shares that sense of despair. Now 30, he was forced out of Homs by the fighting in 2014. Although he has found work and an apartment in Syria's northern Idlib province, he is deeply disillusioned by what has become of Syria and dreams of leaving to start a new life abroad.
""We didn't want to destroy our country and create this rift among Syrians,"" he said. ""If I could go back in time, I wouldn't have joined the protests.""
He asked to be identified only by his nom de guerre for fear of upsetting rebels in Idlib.
The civil war has killed 511,000 people, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and forced over 5.4 million to flee the county, according to U.N. data. It has also caused a refugee crisis in neighboring countries and western Europe and inspired fatal attacks from Nice to Los Angeles.
(Years of deadly days in Syria: http://tmsnrt.rs/2HB9bkG) 
It is a civil war that has laid bare the international community's inability to resolve conflicts on such a scale, increasing strains between Russia and the West.
Abu Farhan had studied physical education at university in Homs before the war and was working as a kitchen fitter. He threw his lot in with Assad's opponents when he joined anti-government protesters pouring out of the Khaled bin al-Walid mosque in Homs.
Abu Farhan put aside his studies and his hopes of marriage, and began organizing protests. 
His best friend and favorite cousin both disappeared under arrest. Last year he found out that they were killed - a fate which human rights groups say has befallen tens of thousands in Assad's prisons. The president denies the accusations. 
By February 2012, the Syrian army was regularly shelling the district where Abu Farhan lived in the Jouret al Shayyah district of Homs near the Old City. But he chose not to fight. 
""I knew that taking up arms would be a curse, not a blessing,"" he said. 
As fighting intensified and warplanes began bombing city blocks in late 2012, he left his home with his parents and two siblings for al-Waer, a quieter opposition area in another part of the city. 
Waer was soon subjected to a siege that lasted until 2017 and food became more scarce. During Ramadan, the Muslim holy month when people traditionally eat delicacies at night after fasting through the daylight hours, he says the family usually had only bulgur wheat to break their fast. 
""Sometimes we didn't even have that,"" he said. 
Terrified of arrest by Assad's security forces - which he believed would lead to torture and summary execution - Abu Farhan and his family joined rebels who left for Idlib in a negotiated withdrawal, surrendering Waer to the government. 
Idlib will never feel like home for Abu Farhan. ""I am a refugee here,"" he said. 
After leaving Waer, he and his sister both found jobs in Idlib, with Abu Farhan working as a fitness instructor. 
Despite overcrowding caused by the flood of refugees from other parts of Syria, they were able to rent an apartment. For now, though, Abu Farhan is unable to get to work in the southern part of Idlib because bombing by pro-Assad forces makes his journey too dangerous. 
The bombing, destruction and what he sees as the intolerance of rebel groups running Idlib have convinced him there is no point staying in Syria. He has started learning Turkish and hopes to gain refugee status.
JIHADIST AND EXILE 
Abu al-Baraa was a schoolboy in Waer when the protests began, but volunteered as a hospital orderly and helped injured demonstrators hide from the police. He briefly became a medical student, while it was still possible to travel into the university in central Homs. 
Realising he was now a wanted man because of his actions, he joined the Nusra Front. He said the group seemed to represent his conservative religious views and that he became aware of its true nature and violent militancy only later.
""We didn't know then that the Nusra Front was affiliated to al Qaeda. We had a religious upbringing, and they lured us in with their religious beliefs,"" said Abu al-Baraa. 
The Nusra Front's brutal methods were soon evident to Abu al-Baraa, as was the split between jihadist and nationalist groups that has plagued the uprising. 
""They established security apparatuses and prisons just like the (Assad government) regime, where they tortured people,"" Abu al-Baraa said. ""I know of at least one man who died under torture and was later shown to be innocent.""
After only a few months fighting with the group, he was stripped of his gun and mobile phone for opposing its actions and he started volunteering at a medical center.
His disillusionment with the Nusra Front and other rebels grew and he publicly argued with the group's local commander, who threw him into prison.
He was held in a dark underground cell infested with rats and was tortured, he said. 
""They faked 15 accusations against me, including theft and spying for the regime. After 12 days of living hell, I collapsed and confessed to the fake accusations,"" he said.
While he wasted in prison the rebellion, undermined by internal wrangling and facing a government strengthened by the arrival of Russian warplanes, was losing ground. 
When its enclave in the city of Aleppo fell to Assad in late 2016, it led to a series of surrenders of other small opposition pockets around Syria. Waer was one of them. 
Abu al-Baraa was stuck in prison, but he still had friends in the Nusra Front who managed to smuggle him out. He was able to board one of a number of green buses sent by the government to evacuate the rebels, and made it to Idlib.
For Abu al-Baraa, worried he was in danger from the Nusra Front and now using false documents, the misery and poverty of Idlib offered no haven. 
""Two or three families shared one small apartment, taking turns to sleep,"" he said.
Six weeks after arriving there, he made the dangerous border crossing into Turkey with the help of the same people who had rescued him from prison. It was his seventh attempt.
Mow living in Istanbul with his mother and younger brother, Abu al-Baraa says the trauma of that time, when the sound of jets meant an attack could be imminent, still affects them.
""We live near the airport. Whenever a plane takes off or lands, my brother runs crying to his mother,"" he said. 
Their father did not make it out of Syria. He died of a stroke in Waer in 2014. Abu al-Baraa still fears his former rebel allies enough to be identified only by his nom de guerre. 
REBEL COMMANDER
When anti-government protests began in the city of Idlib in 2011, Fouad al-Ghraibi quickly joined them.
There was never any question where his allegiances lay. Thirteen of his uncles and cousins, all from the family's home village of Kafr Oueid in Idlib province, were killed or jailed when government forces crushed a years-long revolt by the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist organization, in 1982. 
Ghraibi was shot in the hand and abdomen when Assad cracked down on the protesters and was taken to Turkey for treatment.
Returning to Idlib months later, he gathered friends to join the Free Syrian Army (FSA), an alliance of rebel groups backed by Western and Arab countries. 
Disappointed by divisions in the FSA, he later joined Jaish al-Islam, a better organized Islamist coalition backed by Saudi Arabia where he was put in charge of 150 fighters. 
Three of his brothers, Mokhlis, Khaled and Mustafa, were killed in combat in the northwest, scene of some of the fiercest fighting of the war. An air strike on his village in June 2015 killed 33 civilians, including his niece. 
When an alliance of jihadist groups led by the Nusra Front, which changed its name in 2016, took over much of Idlib last year, Ghraibi returned home to Kafr Oueid. 
Once there, he set up a group of 45 local fighters which he hopes will defend the village from both Assad and the Islamist factions, and return the revolution to the ideals he believes it originally espoused. 
All it has done so far is contribute yet another small armed faction to a civil war that shows no sign of ending.

1112,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",Explainer: Foreign powers obstruct more Assad gains in Syria,"By Tom Perry and Laila Bassam
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syria's war is reaching a point where President Bashar al-Assad's will not be able to win back much more territory without risking conflicts with foreign powers that have sent military forces to the country.
The expected conquest of eastern Ghouta will be another milestone in Assad's effort to crush the rebellion as the war enters its eighth year with Russia and Iran still firmly behind him.
Assad's foreign enemies have condemned the assault but failed to stop it, as was seen in Homs, Aleppo and other areas where pro-government forces crushed outgunned rebels.
But the map of the conflict suggests difficulties ahead for Assad in his quest to recover ""every inch"" of a country fractured by a war that has killed half a million people and driven 5.4 million abroad.
The U.S. military is in much of the east and northeast, which is controlled by Kurdish groups that want autonomy from Damascus. It has used force to defend the territory from pro-Assad forces.
Turkey has sent forces into the northwest to counter those same Kurdish groups, carving out a buffer zone where anti-Assad rebels have regrouped.
In the southwest, where rebels hold territory at the Israeli and Jordanian border, Assad faces the risk of conflict with Israel, which wants his Iranian-backed allies kept well away from the frontier and has mounted air strikes in Syria.
Some believe a divided Syria may stabilize for some time - perhaps years - with Assad forced to accept a de facto partition and no prospect of a negotiated peace. Others fear further escalation involving Turkey, the United States, Israel, Iran and Russia.
""I don't think victory is as near as the Syrian government perceives it to be,"" said David Lesch, an expert on Syria, noting that Assad was now facing ""a diplomatic quagmire"".
Assad believes he can ""wait out"" foreign powers, notably Turkey and the United States, but it is going to be a very long time, if ever, before he can extend real control over the rest of the country, Lesch said.
CONFIDENCE IN DAMASCUS
The conflict grew out of popular protests against Assad and evolved into a violent insurgency and civil war after the government responded with force. It has laid waste to swathes of Syria, helped the rise of Islamic State, fed sectarianism, and seen the deadliest use of chemical weapons since the 1980s.
Backed by Iran and Russia, Assad has recovered ground from rebels whose supporters - the United States, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey - never gave them the weapons to defeat him.
Reflecting confidence in Damascus, first lady Asma al-Assad, has stepped back into public life. She has visited special needs children and accompanied Assad to meet the wounded. Assad has appeared on the currency for the first time.
Any serious discussion about Assad's future has been off the table for some time: Western and Arab states that backed the opposition sidestepped the issue entirely in recent recommendations to the moribund U.N.-led peace talks.
The West still hopes Russia will put pressure on Assad, and is withholding reconstruction aid until a negotiated political transition to end the war is underway. But many Syria analysts say that for Russia there is no dependable alternative to Assad.
At its weakest point in 2015, the Syrian state held less than a fifth of Syria. Russia's air force arrived to turn the tide in September of that year, working with Iranian and Iranian-backed forces spearheaded by Lebanon's Hezbollah, which has been fighting in support of Assad since 2012.
After defeating insurgents in Aleppo, Assad and his allies swept across Syria last year, recovering territory all the way to the Iraqi border from Islamic State's crumbling ""caliphate"".
Assad now holds 58 percent of Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, including the main cities, the coast, and an expanse of desert west of the Euphrates. 
The government is now trying to finish off the rebellion in western Syria. The defeat of eastern Ghouta may hasten the demise of remaining rebel pockets near Damascus, Homs and Hama.
DETERRING ISRAEL
The southwest is also back in focus. This week, rebels say the government launched its first air strikes there since a truce last year brokered by Russia and the United States.
The southwest is one area where Russian and Iranian priorities seem to differ. For Iran, Syria is a frontline state in the struggle with Israel, which fears Tehran is establishing permanent garrisons in Syria. Russia has been engaging with Israel, which is looking to Moscow to rein in Iran.
A commander in the regional military alliance fighting in support of Assad said Israeli demands for a ""buffer zone"" stretching from the Golan frontier into Syria were unacceptable.
""We will increase the level of deterrent force against Israel in southern Syria,"" the commander said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Assad's aims include reopening the crossing to Jordan, a vital trade route. The rebels in southern Syria are backed by Jordan, the United States and - according to Syrian officials - Israel.
The shooting down of an Israeli F-16 as it returned from a bombing run in Syria last month highlighted the risks of conflict between Iran and Israel in Syria.
Containing Iran is one goal of a newly crystallized U.S. policy towards Syria, where Washington has established leverage through its alliance with the Kurdish YPG militia that controls around one quarter of the country.
Some 2,000 U.S. forces have deployed in the territory held by the YPG and its allies during the campaign against Islamic State. The area covers the eastern bank of the Euphrates and includes oil fields and farmland.
""DREAMING OF GUERRILLA WAR""
U.S. goals have broadened beyond fighting Islamic State to curbing Iran and paving the way diplomatically for Assad's eventual departure, though Washington's call for ""patience"" on that front points to the difficulties.
""The Syrians are dreaming of how to use guerrilla war against the Americans, but it is hard to get to them and they are protected by the YPG. America has gotten smarter about occupying Arab countries,"" said Syria expert Joshua Landis.
A senior opposition official forecast that Syria would stabilize, divided into spheres of influence. ""It could stay like this for two years, or 10 years,"" he said.
The United States is trying to manage tension with its NATO ally Turkey over its support for the Kurds. Ankara's main aim is to roll back the YPG, which it views as an extension of a Kurdish insurgent group in Turkey.
It is in the process of widening its buffer zone into the predominantly Kurdish Afrin region, where Moscow's priorities also appear to differ from those of Damascus and Tehran. Russia gave Turkey the green light for the attack, while Tehran and Damascus are concerned by Turkey's growing footprint.
The Turkish sphere also extends into Idlib province, but this time with the consent of Russia and Iran. Idlib is controlled by jihadists and hosts thousands of dissidents forced from other areas by Assad.
It appears to be far down his list of priorities. The pro-Assad commander said it was up to Turkey to deploy according to its agreement with Iran and Russia and end the presence of al Qaeda organizations in Idlib.

""The problem with Turkey is in Afrin,"" the commander added. ""We won't accept the terrorists ... advancing and occupying Afrin,"" he added, referring to the anti-Assad Syrian groups fighting alongside Turkish forces.

1113,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",Rape used as wide-scale weapon of war in Syria: U.N. report,"By Stephanie Nebehay
GENEVA (Reuters) - Syrian government forces and allied militias have raped and sexually assaulted women, girls and men in a campaign to punish opposition communities - acts that constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity, U.N. investigators said on Thursday.
In a major report, they found that opposition groups in Syria's protracted civil war had also committed crimes of sexual violence and torture although these were ""considerably less common"". 
The report also said Islamic State (IS) and other armed extremist groups have executed women, men and children on charges of adultery, forced girls into marriage and persecuted homosexuals.
The 29-page report by the U.N. Commission of Inquiry, issued as Syria enters its eighth year of war, is based on 454 interviews with survivors, relatives, eyewitnesses, defectors, lawyers and medical staff. 
Government forces raped civilians of both sexes during house searches and ground operations in the early stages of the conflict, and later at checkpoints and detention facilities, it said. The youngest known victim was a nine-year-old girl. 
""Rape of women and girls was documented in 20 government political and military intelligence branches, and rape of men and boys was documented in 15 branches,"" the report by the U.N. war crimes investigators said.
The independent experts led by Paulo Pinheiro - who have compiled confidential lists of suspects since 2011 - did not name individual perpetrators but said they had documented ""numerous"" cases of rapes by high-level officers.
Branches where rapes took place included Aleppo, Deraa, Homs, Hama and Damascus, as well as Sednaya military prison and the air force intelligence branch at Mezzeh military airport, both near the capital, the report said. 
""Sexual violence against females and males is used to force confessions, to extract information, as punishment as well as to terrorize opposition communities,"" the report said.
Victims suffered shame, depression, incontinence, impotence and miscarriages, and rejection by their families, it said.
The investigators found ""no evidence of a systematic practice"" on the part of armed groups to use sexual and gender-based violence to instill fear, but said that incidents had occurred in the context of sectarianism or revenge attacks.
Throughout Syria's conflict, U.N. investigators had received allegations of extremist and terrorist groups imposing ""mediaeval punishments on men accused of homosexuality"". 
Women accused of adultery have been killed by stoning by the Islamist Jabhat Fateh al-Sham group, while homosexual men were thrown off a building by Jabhat al-Nusra jihadists, according to the report.

1114,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",Case of commander wanted by ICC opens rift in east Libyan forces,"By Aidan Lewis
TUNIS (Reuters) - Uncertainty over the status of a Libyan commander wanted by the International Criminal Court has opened a rift between military leaders who detained him for questioning, and fighters who staged protests to force his release.
The Hague-based ICC indicted Mahmoud al-Werfalli, a special forces commander, last August in connection with dozens of summary executions but he remains in Libya where he has been accused of further killings.
His case has exposed one of the faultlines in forces led by General Khalifa Haftar, which are based in eastern Libya, as they push to extend their control in the south and west of the divided oil producing nation. 
Werfalli is wanted over the killings of more than 30 captives during a campaign by Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) against Islamists and other opponents in the eastern city of Benghazi. He serves in a unit attached to the LNA, which played a leading role in the campaign.
The allegations are awkward for Haftar, who has courted foreign governments and the United Nations after gradually consolidating his military position in eastern Libya and emerging as the most prominent contender to lead the country.
Reports of new killings emerged in January as Haftar received U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame at his headquarters in Rajma, near the city of Benghazi. The U.N.'s Libya mission said both men had ""emphasized the importance of holding elections in 2018"", polls which Haftar has signaled he would contest.
Images surfaced appearing to show Werfalli shooting dead 10 blindfolded prisoners outside a mosque in retaliation for a twin car bombing.
Two weeks later, military sources said he had handed himself in at the LNA headquarters for questioning, leading supporters to block roads in Benghazi in protest. Werfalli was released the same night, before returning to Rajma where he has stayed for the past few weeks as military police investigate him, military sources say.
LNA spokesman Ahmed al-Mismari said Werfalli had been released on bail after the first part of the investigation. Werfalli would not be handed over to the ICC, he said, because of the ""integrity and strictness"" of the Libyan justice system.
Interpol issued a red notice for Werfalli's arrest late last month. 
DISPARATE BRIGADES 
Analysts say the episode also shows the limits of Haftar's control over parts of the LNA, which drew in disparate brigades including ultraconservative Salafists in the ""Dignity Operation"" that it launched in Benghazi in 2014.
Restoring order and ending chaos is a constant theme in Haftar's speeches.
Special forces head Wanis Boukhamada is a popular figure and Werfalli himself has a loyal following. Last week, friends of Werfalli released a video statement demanding information about his detention.
""This person is a hero, a savior and a symbol of Dignity (Operation),"" a man reading the statement said. ""If you detain him for killing terrorists, why do you not also detain the pilots and the artillery and the Salafists and everyone who participated in Dignity?"" 
At a meeting with Boukhamada and other special forces commanders last month, Haftar said Werfalli's case was ""a national case, and the nation is greater than any court"", according to several sources present. 
Last week, Boukhamada had to intervene personally to persuade Werfalli supporters who had closed Benghazi roads for a second time to end their protest. 

""The (LNA) general command need to release Mahmoud al-Werfalli immediately, Mahmoud killed Daesh (Islamic State) members, not innocent people,"" one of the protesters said.

1115,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 08:31AM ET</span>","Greece can do more to weed out corruption, watchdog agency says","By Michele Kambas
ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece should tighten the rules of conduct for its legislators and judiciary to prevent corruption, a senior official in the Council of Europe's anti-corruption agency said in an interview.
Graft has long been considered a cause of economic malaise in Greece, which has required three international bailouts since 2010 in return for reforms. The bailouts imposed deep austerity and hardship on the country's 11 million people. 
The Strasbourg-based Council of Europe, a 47-nation human rights body that has no legislative powers, has praised Greece for adopting a code of conduct for its lawmakers and for improving their declarations of assets. 
But Athens needed to do more to provide transparency in political-party financing and interaction with lobbyists, said Gianluca Esposito, executive secretary of the council's Group of States against Corruption, known as GRECO.
He also cited a need for a clearer distinction between the executive and the judiciary and for easing bottlenecks in the justice system. 
""I think corruption has had an impact, has contributed to getting where we are and into a situation where the economy was struggling,"" Esposito said, referring to the economic crisis.
""That was a long time ago. Things have now certainly improved. The key is not to stop in the middle, but to continue on the reform process.""
Two reports issued by GRECO this month noted Greece had introduced asset declarations for lawmakers and adopted a code of conduct. But it was concerned about an apparent regression in allowing some anonymity in donating to political parties. 
It also expressed misgivings over a lack of clear criteria in lifting parliamentary immunity in cases to facilitate inquiries. In Greece's case, refusal to lift parliamentary immunity significantly outweighed the number of requests approved.
""There are no clear criteria,"" Esposito said. ""It's important for members of parliament to exercise their work without the fear of political prosecution.
""... However, immunity doesn't mean impunity. Immunity doesn't shield a person from corruption and in most countries there are very transparent criteria about how this immunity is lifted.""
Among 180 countries or territories around the world, Greece ranks 59th, with a score of 48 on the public perception of corruption out of 100, according to a 2017 report by advocacy body Transparency International. That put it behind its EU peers Italy and Spain and level with Romania and Jordan.
""I don't rank countries,"" Esposito said. Corruption existed in every country in one manifestation or another, which is why prevention was needed to prevent it taking hold, he said.

""It is like a virus ... When it becomes the norm, nothing works anymore. Democracy doesn't work anymore. The economy doesn't work anymore, and the rule of law simply doesn't exist.""

1117,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 10:23AM ET</span>",Putin rides 'Russia First' wave toward election victory,"By Christian Lowe and Natalia Shurmina
MOSCOW/YEKATERINBURG, Russia (Reuters) - Russian voters are set to propel Vladimir Putin to another term as president in an election on Sunday, giving him credit for standing up for Russia against Western governments that view him as a dangerous autocrat.
Opinion polls show Putin, 65, with a commanding election lead, all but guaranteeing him another term that will take him to nearly a quarter century in power -- a longevity among Kremlin leaders second only to Josef Stalin.
The only thing that could dampen Putin's poll triumph is if voter apathy at a predictable contest leads to a low turnout, or if the minority of Russians who vocally oppose him take to the streets to protest against what they see as an undemocratic farce.
In an election campaign where Putin has benefited from glowing coverage on mainstream television, he has cast himself as the only person who can defend Russia's national interests in a hostile world.
""We will withstand this onslaught,"" Svetlana Andrus, a ribbon round her neck in the colors of the Russian flag, said during a rally in Moscow in support of Putin. ""We will support our country and Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin).""
Putin's supporters point to Russia's military intervention in Syria and its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014 as proof of his patriotic credentials. They say U.S. and European sanctions imposed over the Ukraine crisis are a price worth paying.
A row with Britain over allegations the Kremlin used a nerve agent to poison a Russian double agent in a sleepy English town -- denied by Moscow -- has not dented his standing.
BOYCOTT CAMPAIGN
A March 9 survey by state-run pollster VTsIOM gave Putin, who was first elected president in 2000, support of 69 percent. His nearest rival Pavel Grudinin, the Communist Party's candidate, is on just 7 percent.
Another candidate, Ksenia Sobchak, a TV presenter and family friend of Putin, has upended expectations by robustly criticizing the Kremlin, but she has only 2 percent support, the same survey showed.
Kremlin officials acknowledge that Putin's dominance could turn people off voting. A low turnout would dent his legitimacy within the ruling elite, founded in part on his ability to command popular support.
In Yekaterinburg, an industrial city in the Ural mountains, unemployed 38-year-old Sergei Khaziev described the election as a ""circus performance which for some reason is described as elections... I won't turn out this time.""
The first politician in years to challenge the Kremlin's grip on power, Alexei Navalny, is not on the ballot. He was barred because of a corruption conviction he says was fabricated by the Kremlin.
Navalny, who uses social media to whip up anger among his mainly young followers over official corruption, is pushing an election boycott. 
""Our boycott campaign is working,"" he said this week. As evidence, Navalny pointed to a drive by officials to encourage people to turn out to vote by offering discounted food at polling stations. He also said state officials were applying pressure on civil servants and students to vote.
BURDENS OF OFFICE
Though winning another term is virtually assured, governing Russia for another six years will throw up plentiful challenges.
Buffeted by lower oil prices and the effect of Western sanctions, Russia's gross domestic product expanded by only 1.5 percent last year, well below the robust growth Russians had come to expect in the earlier years of Putin's rule.
Putin has spoken of the need to revive economic growth but the steps that many economists prescribe - especially shrinking the state's role in the economy - are resisted by those in the president's circle who owe their status and wealth to the state.
His next term may also be overshadowed by uncertainty over his plans once it ends. Term limits bar him from running for another consecutive term, and Putin has said he will not change the constitution to extend his time in office.
Sources inside Russia's ruling elite say they anticipate he will repeat the maneuver he deployed in 2008, the last time he faced term limits, when a loyal lieutenant took over the presidency while Putin governed from behind the scenes.
If Putin, who will be 71 when his next term ends, wants a peaceful retirement, however, he will have to try to engineer a succession. That risks unleashing simmering tensions between rival groups in the ruling elite.

Voting starts in the far east of the vast Russian Federation at 8 am local time (4 p.m. ET on Saturday) and will roll westwards over 11 time zones, with polling booths in the Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad due to close at 1900 GMT (3 p.m. ET) on Sunday.

1118,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 08:34AM ET</span>",Saudi crown prince says will develop nuclear bomb if Iran does: CBS TV,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will develop a nuclear bomb if its arch-rival Iran does so, the kingdom's 32-year-old crown prince said in a preview of a television interview released on Thursday.
""Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb, but without a doubt if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible,"" Prince Mohammed bin Salman told CBS in an interview that will air on Sunday.
The kingdom, locked in a tussle for influence with Iran across the Middle East and beyond, is stepping up plans to develop a nuclear energy capability as part of a reform plan led by Prince Mohammed to reduce the economy’s dependence on oil.
The United States, South Korea, Russia, France and China are bidding on a multi-billion dollar tender to build Saudi Arabia's first two nuclear reactors.
The world's top oil exporter has previously said it wants nuclear technology only for peaceful uses but has left unclear whether it also wants to enrich uranium to produce nuclear fuel, a process which can also be used in the production of atomic weapons.
The government approved a national policy for its atomic energy program on Tuesday, including limiting all nuclear activities to peaceful purposes, within the limits defined by international treaties.

Reactors need uranium enriched to around five percent purity but the same technology in this process can also be used to enrich the heavy metal to a higher, weapons-grade level.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's office was aware in early March of potential problems with documents about a controversial land sale to a school operator with ties to Abe's wife, his top spokesman has said, amid suspicions of a cover-up.
Abe and Finance Minister Taro Aso have faced fire since the finance ministry's admission this week that it had altered records involved in the discounted sale of the land in western Japan.
The affair has sparked calls for Aso to quit and could dash Abe's chances of securing another three-year term from September, when the ruling party will hold a leadership election.
Abe has denied wrongdoing by himself or his wife Akie, while Aso has denied he instructed changes to the records. 
However, the details of the suicide note left by a finance ministry employee in western Japan who was found dead at his home on March 7, could prompt calls from opposition lawmakers for the resignations of both Abe and Aso.
""Some parts of the documents were too detailed, and my boss forced me to rewrite it,"" NHK quoted the note as saying. ""If this continues, I will be forced to bear all the responsibility by myself.""
A police spokesman declined to comment.
Yasunori Kagoike, the purchaser of the land, and his wife were arrested in July on suspicion of illegally receiving subsidies.

1122,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 07:31AM ET</span>",Foes band together to challenge Modi in 2019 India elections,"By Krishna N. Das
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Small Indian parties are banding together against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for next year's general election, energized by an unlikely win in an election for a handful of parliamentary seats in the Hindi heartland on Wednesday.
Opposition strategists say the only way Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) juggernaut can be stopped is to join forces and turn 2019 into a ""Modi versus the rest"" election.
That strategy seemed to have paid off when two bickering caste-based factions worked together in the country's most politically important state, Uttar Pradesh in the north, to defeat Modi's party in two seats this week. 
Mamata Banerjee, the chief of an opposition party in eastern India, called the Uttar Pradesh results, and victory for a regional party in another seat in neighboring Bihar state, the ""beginning of the end"" for Modi's party.
The Nehru-Gandhi dynasty's Congress party, which ruled India for most of the seven decades after independence before being thumped by Modi in the last general election 2014, also seized on the latest setbacks for the BJP.
""The results from the by-polls make it clear that voters are very angry at the BJP and that they will vote for that non-BJP candidate who has the best chance of winning,"" said Congress chief Rahul Gandhi.
Congress has started stitching together alliances and hosted a dinner for opposition parties this week.
Congress spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala said it was ready to lead any alliance of regional groups and could discuss such plans in a party conference this weekend.
BJP leaders said they were caught off-guard by the alliance of the two regional parties, known as the BSP and SP in Uttar Pradesh.
""We will prepare for a situation in future when BSP, SP and Congress can come together, and also make our strategy for winning 2019 the election,"" said the BJP's deputy chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Keshav Prasad Maurya.
'SELLING DREAMS'
There is nobody close to Modi in personal approval ratings.
Nearly nine out of 10 Indians hold a favorable opinion of him, according to a research report published in November, and opposition victories in a handful of seats cannot be seen as an indication the mood is swinging away from Modi and the BJP nationally, analysts warn. 
When Modi won office in 2014 with the most resounding victory in three decades, his party or its partners ruled only seven of India's 29 states. 
Today, it is in power in 21 of them and has replaced Congress as the party with strongest nationwide presence.
But in by-elections in 10 parliamentary seats since last year, the BJP has lost all of them. That may be an indication an anti-incumbency factor will play a part in 2019.
Ghanshyam Tiwari, spokesman for the Samajwadi Party (SP)whose two candidates won this week's Uttar Pradesh by-elections, said the BJP had been winning new states by ""selling dreams"" to voters through glitzy advertisements.
But people in states where the party had been ruling for some time were becoming disillusioned, he said.
""Because of their poor governance model, people are forced to live in bad conditions. So it's reality versus what you are promised,"" Tiwari said.
Although Modi has been able to maintain his popularity, the BJP's ties with allies have been strained in recent months, and any more setbacks would likely raise new doubts.

""Modi's appeal is formidable but his enemies and allies would now think he's beatable,"" veteran journalist and political commentator Shekhar Gupta said on Twitter.

General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko said on Thursday he had ""irrefutable proof"" that Savchenko, who became a member of parliament on her return from Russia, had planned an attack using grenades, mortars and automatic weapons.
The attack did not take place.
Savchenko could not immediately be reached for comment, and neither could her sister who has spoken for her in the past.
Lutsenko said he would ask lawmakers to vote to remove Savchenko's parliamentary immunity from prosecution so that she could be arrested.
""The investigation has irrefutable proof that Nadiya Savchenko ... personally planned, personally recruited, personally gave instructions about how to commit a terrorist act here, in this chamber,"" Lutsenko said.
Savchenko has experienced a rapid fall from grace since she returned to great fanfare after a prisoner exchange with Russia in May 2016.
In January 2017, lawmakers called for an investigation into what they said were her anti-Ukrainian actions after Savchenko suggested Ukraine would have to relax its claim on Crimea - annexed by Russia in 2014 - in order to win back control of its eastern Donbass region where pro-Russia rebels hold sway.
Savchenko was captured on the frontline by pro-Russian separatists and held in jail in Russia on murder charges that she said were fabricated. She became a symbol of resistance against Russia to many Ukrainians.

Since her return she has held talks with the separatists without the government's consent and published secret lists of people who were captured or are missing in the conflict.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Any move by Britain to cut its gas imports from Russia would be ""politically motivated"", the Russian energy minister said on Thursday, amid a worsening rift between Moscow and London over the poisoning of a former Russian double agent in England.
Prime Minister Theresa May announced on Wednesday that Britain would kick out 23 Russian diplomats, the biggest such expulsion since the Cold War, over the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter with a nerve agent.
May has squarely blamed Russia for the attack and also said Britain was looking to reduce its gas imports from the country. Moscow denies any involvement in the attack and has vowed to retaliate against the measures announced by London.
""Every country has the right to choose its own energy policy... Any decision (by Britain to cut Russian gas imports would be) politically motivated and not aimed at developing competition on the European (gas) market,"" Alexander Novak told reporters.
Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), which holds a monopoly on Russia's gas pipeline exports, supplied a total of 16.3 billion cubic meters of gas to Britain last year, slightly less than a year earlier, but still accounting for a fifth of the country's total gas consumption. 
Gas exports to Britain represent only 10 percent of Gazprom's total exports to western Europe. Germany remains its biggest buyer in Europe, taking a third of overall Russian gas exports.

Last year Novatek, Russia's largest private gas producer, started liquefied natural gas exports, which could be shipped to any point globally depending on cost.

1132,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 05:32AM ET</span>","After turmoil at home, Egypt struggles to revive power abroad","By Nadine Awadalla and John Davison
CAIRO (Reuters) - When Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman chose Egypt for his first official trip abroad since becoming crown prince, Cairo draped its streets with banners declaring the two countries to be ""the beating heart"" of the Middle East.
The prince paid tribute to Cairo's importance, saying ""when Egypt rises, so can the whole region"".
""I prayed to God that Egypt would not collapse,"" he told editors in Cairo, referring to the upheaval which followed Egypt's 2011 popular uprising. ""What I saw today confirmed to me that God answered my prayer.""
But the remarks by the powerful Saudi heir this month also showed how Egypt, once the leader of the Arab world, has yet to reclaim its position while power and influence shift east to wealthy and assertive Gulf oil exporters.
Gulf Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are increasingly engaged in foreign forays, deploying money and arms to intervene in regional conflicts and to shore up struggling allies such as Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, whose forces are fighting an Islamic State insurgency in the Sinai peninsula.
After stagnating in the last years of former president Hosni Mubarak, Egypt saw its regional standing erode further after Mubarak's 2011 overthrow and the political turbulence, economic crisis and Islamist attacks which followed.
Supporters of Sisi, who seeks re-election this month, say the former general could bring security and revive Egypt's pivotal role in mediating Middle East peace talks.
Diplomats say, however, that as long as Egypt faces internal security problems and the region is volatile, Cairo will focus on issues close to home such as militants in Gaza and Libya, and an Ethiopian dam that threatens its water supply. Thorny topics such as Palestinian-Israeli peace will take a back seat.
""In certain periods of time there is no question that we determined war and peace in the Middle East,"" said diplomat Nabil Fahmy, who was a young official when Egypt became the first Arab state to make peace with Israel in 1978.
Egypt's upheaval has meant that recent years have been challenging for Cairo's diplomacy, said Fahmy, was foreign minister for a year after Sisi took power in 2013 and also served as Egypt's ambassador to Washington under Mubarak.
""When you have ... been through a process of transition ... people look at you and say ‘Well, you know, you're busy’, therefore you can't really have that kind of influence,"" he told Reuters.
Sisi overthrew Mohamed Mursi, Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood president, in 2013 after widespread protests and is all but guaranteed to win the March 26-28 vote against an opponent who has praised, not challenged, him.
Sisi shares Saudi Arabia's opposition to the Brotherhood and has largely aligned Egypt with Riyadh and the UAE, joining their boycott of Qatar and supporting, to a limited extent, their fight against Iran-allied Houthi fighters in Yemen.
Although Sisi steered a separate course over Syria, choosing not to follow Riyadh's hawkish line against President Bashar al-Assad, his agreement to hand two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia reinforced the sense that Cairo had become a junior partner. 
With its population nearing 100 million, almost a quarter of the Arab world, Egypt's stability remains crucial to the region, but it rarely takes the lead now when crises unfold. 
When President Donald Trump announced in December he was moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, Sisi criticized the decision but it was Turkey, not Egypt, which called an emergency summit of Muslim leaders to condemn the move.
NARROWED HORIZONS
In his first term of office, Sisi has strengthened ties with Russia and China, trying to reduce dependence on a four-decade partnership with the United States which has brought Egypt tens of billion of dollars in aid.
Egypt's most pressing foreign policy concerns, however, lie just across its borders. To the west, the chaos of Libya since Muammmar Gaddafi's overthrow seven years ago has created a dangerous security threat on Cairo's doorstep.
To the east, Palestinian rivalries have created instability in Gaza - though that is overshadowed by the crisis in the neighboring Sinai, where Egyptian troops are battling jihadists.
Looking south, Cairo is alarmed by Ethiopia's construction of a dam on the Nile, threatening the water supply on which nearly all Egypt's agriculture depends. Ethiopia announced the start of work weeks after Mubarak was overthrown, when Egypt's domestic turmoil left it few options to respond.
For now Egypt ""will be forced to deal with the fires that are raging around us because they create a sense of urgency,"" Fahmy said.
Domestic priorities, set by Egypt's dominant military establishment, have also narrowed the horizons for Cairo's diplomacy, a Western diplomat said. 
""Nile water, Libya and Gaza are the three key issues it cares about,"" the diplomat said. ""All are driven by the internal agenda rather than a desire for a regional role.""
The primary reason for Egypt's involvement in Gaza, where it has tried to broker reconciliation between rival factions, is security, the diplomat said.
Egypt's foreign ministry has said it views Israeli-Palestinian peace as an urgent priority.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Ahmed Abu Zeid said both Libya and Gaza were primarily security issues.
Egypt is trying to reduce smuggling of weapons and militants across its 1,200 km (750 mile) desert border with Libya, he told Reuters, while in Gaza it wants to help pacify the territory and mediate between Gaza's ruling Islamist Hamas movement and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.
The Middle East faces huge security and humanitarian challenges, Abu Zeid said, and ""by default this requires more attention to security issues.""
Former minister Fahmy, who was involved in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority after the 1993 Oslo accords, said turmoil since the Arab Spring uprisings seven years go meant Egypt has some way to go to regain its influence, but there was still room for Cairo to find a role.

""(Our) niche was we were the pro-active guys,"" he said. ""So as difficult as these years have been, I actually think it's driven us to take charge of our own problems again and to engage in the different issues around us.""

QUANG NGAI, Vietnam (Reuters) - It took Pham Thi Thuan a while before she could muster the courage to fetch water from across the ditch where 170 of her neighbors, most of them women and children, were killed by U.S. troops during the Vietnam War.
""When I heard cats mewing at night, it sounded like those babies were still crying,"" said Thuan.
On March 16, 1968, 504 people were killed by American soldiers in Son My, a collection of hamlets between the central Vietnamese coast and a ridge of misty mountains, in an incident known in the West as the My Lai Massacre.
It was the worst recorded U.S. war crime committed in Vietnam, but preparations for a 50th anniversary ceremony at the site, now a memorial to the victims, are low key. 
The ceremony falls just one week after a landmark visit by a U.S. aircraft carrier to the nearby port city of Danang, testament to warming ties between the former foes.
Because of those better relations, Vietnam is not dwelling on the pain of the past, a senior Vietnamese government official told Reuters.
""Vietnam wants to close the door to the past and look to the future,"" said the official, who declined to be identified, citing the sensitivity of the issue.
Dang Ngoc Dung, deputy chairman of the Quang Ngai Province People's Committee, said Vietnam wanted to ""befriend everyone now"". 
""We won't let anyone harm us again,"" said Dung.
DARKNESS, SILENCE
Vo Cao Loi was 16 when he saw American helicopters buzz low over his family's house on the clear, sunny morning of the massacre. 
That was not unusual, Loi said. American troops often passed through the area in then U.S.-backed South Vietnam.
""We were used to it,"" said Loi. ""But we didn't expect them to kill everybody.""
Loi's mother gave him a bag filled with rice and spare clothes and told him to hide. 
He watched beneath coconut trees by a river as U.S. troops dragged women and children out of their houses and shot them.
""I could usually see my house from where I was hiding, but there was smoke everywhere. All I could hear were explosions, and the ground was shaking,"" said Loi, who worried that U.S. soldiers were throwing grenades into village shelters.
""I was hoping I was wrong, but it turned out I was right"".
Loi's mother, older sister and her five-month-old son were killed by a grenade tossed into their shelter.
It was not until 3 p.m. that day that the shooting stopped.
""Only then did the survivors start crying and wailing,"" said Loi, who lost 18 relatives in the massacre.
There were not enough people left to take the dead to the cemetery, Loi said, so Vietnamese guerrillas helped him bury his family in the grounds of their home.
""Everything happened in darkness and silence in fear the Americans would come back"".
Loi joined the Viet Cong guerrillas after the massacre and fought until the end of the war in 1975. 
He and his wife now run a coffee shop in a leafy courtyard in Danang filled with photos of trips to France with his children, and a book documenting former U.S. president Barack Obama's trip to Vietnam in 2015.
""Vietnam and the U.S. have become partners that trust each other,"" said Loi.
""Nobody wants war.""

It included a cardboard cylinder filled with an undetermined type of powder, glue, and many small coins. Police also found two air pistols and weapons used in hand-to-hand combat such as brass knuckles.
The man was arrested on Monday and charged with possession of explosive material. The arrest was made public after a judge extended a detention order on Thursday.
Saipov, an Uzbek immigrant, was arrested immediately after the Oct. 31 attack in which he plowed a truck down a bike lane on Manhattan's West Side. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, which was the deadliest assault on New York City since Sept. 11, 2001.

What was the Syrian opposition's largest piece of territory near the capital Damascus has been split into three encircled pockets by a government offensive that began nearly a month ago. 
The aid convoy will head for the town of Douma in the northern pocket, controlled by rebel faction Jaish al-Islam.
It contains 5,220 ICRC food parcels and 5,220 World Food Programme flour bags, Jaquemet said. A parcel can feed a family of five for one month.
Russia said it expected at least 100 civilians to leave eastern Ghouta, where it daily declares a five-hour ceasefire, on Thursday, Interfax news agency reported. 
This would be the third successive day on which small groups of civilians have left.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The unspoken compact that has anchored the relationship between China's government and its people - stay out of politics and we'll help you prosper - is being tested like never before by President Xi Jinping's move to extend his power.
The decision this week to abolish presidential term limits, setting the stage for Xi to rule indefinitely, has engendered widespread unease and jolted a generation that was brought up largely apathetic about politics.
It also laid bare a corollary to the state-society bargain: that many in China believed that their government would gradually become more liberal and open, not swerve back toward authoritarianism or even to strongman rule, according to analysts.
Xi's first five-year term saw him steadily consolidate power at home through a shock-and-awe anti-corruption campaign while burnishing his credentials as a confident leader championing China's interests on the world stage.
But even among the large number of Chinese who admire Xi and the job he is doing, many feel that amending the constitution was a step too far. Some are considering for the first time just how comfortable they are in a one-party state. 
Despite state media trumpeting the near-unanimous vote by parliament this week to end term limits as reflecting the common ""will of the people"", an undercurrent of anger and even despair online and in cities reflects less than universal acclaim among the broader public.
As China's parliament passed constitutional amendments clearing the way for Xi to stay in power indefinitely on Sunday, social media users focused on a large blue screen in the Great Hall of the People that tallied the nearly 3,000 votes.
Many simply posted screenshots without comment. Some jokingly expressed fears for the tiny number of delegates who dared to not vote in favor.
On WeChat, an article explaining the rationale for abolishing presidential term limits went viral on Sunday, but not for its content.
Lines and lines of smiley-face emojis flooded the article's comments section in a quietly subversive protest. The story was later removed.
""I used to have confidence that our country would become more and more open,"" said one second-year university student, Wendy Zang.
""I think it's a very sad thing if this constitutional amendment only lifts term limits but comes without any steps to restrict power.""
The State Council Information Office, which doubles as the party's spokesman's office, did not respond to a request for comment.
AUTHORITY AND ACQUIESCENCE
There is considerable acquiescence and tolerance for authoritarianism in China, both out of pragmatism but also support for the idea that an uncompromising government is needed to manage a country of China's size.
But the swift undoing of a decades-long institutional check on power, introduced by late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping to prevent the recurrence of one-man rule after Mao Zedong's death, has prompted concern among many Chinese that the country was lurching backwards.
""He wants to be China's Mao Zedong and the only thing missing now is his face on the currency,"" one retiree in Shanghai told Reuters, unhappy that the amendments took place ""too quickly"" and out of public view.
Wu Qiang, an independent Beijing-based political commentator, said Xi overturning Deng's political legacy was, in the minds of some Chinese, tantamount to shaking the political foundation the state-society compact was built upon.
After the term limits were removed, he said, there was ""wide discontent"" but that the past three decades of economic growth had left most lulled into a false sense of security and ""not knowing how to resist"".
""China's politically apathetic middle-class have not organized themselves, they have not learnt political expression or how to protest, they have lost the ability and courage to express themselves,"" Wu said in a telephone interview.
There is little sign, however, that the pockets of quiet dissent could snowball into any public displays of opposition, which speaks to the Communist Party's firm grip on civil society and the narrowing space for free expression under Xi.
One university student in Shanghai said he feared for China's future now and was considering moving abroad, but was cautious about discussing the term limits issue with anyone, and never broached politics online.
""I try not to leave digital records of this kind of conversation,"" he said.
Most people interviewed by Reuters declined to be named even when expressing relatively benign views on China's leaders out of fear they would face repercussions. 
""If the Communist Party tells us the sky is black, then the sky is black,"" said one retiree strolling through Beijing's Temple of Heaven, declining to give his name.
Zi Su, a retired professor, was arrested last year after penning an open letter calling on Xi to resign, saying he had gravely erred by restoring Mao-era ideology while turning his back on Deng's reforms.
Supporters fear Zi, who previously trained cadres at the Communist Party school in southwestern Yunnan province, could now face harsher punishment to deter others considering public dissent.
""Now the constitution has been amended and they say he was trying to subvert state power, the chances of a harsh punishment are higher,"" Zi's sister, Zi Ping, told Reuters.
Another retiree, Wu Beicheng, 57, said his parents were persecuted during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and that he was born with malnutrition during the Great Leap Forward, Mao's disastrous campaign to revolutionize agriculture. He said he worried Xi's ""renegade"" dismantling of recent succession norms risks turmoil when it eventually comes time to transfer power. 
""As an insightful leader he should gradually lead Chinese society to an open and democratic system,"" Wu said. ""It takes time, but it's wrong not to lead the people in that direction just because it takes time.""
ONLINE OUTLET
Still, Xi remains widely popular in China.
One online retailer told Reuters she welcomed the removal of term limits if it meant the continuation of Xi's leadership.
Daniel Cao, a fourth-year university student in Shanghai said he was initially ""astonished"" that the constitution could be ""changed so easily"", and shared the concerns of others online that China would return to an era of cult of personality and one-man rule.
""However, if you think about it another way, when Deng Xiaoping proposed reform and opening up and introduced the market economy some people raised opinions in the same way,"" he said.
""As long as Xi Jinping can lead China to become strong, whatever methods he uses, I can accept them. In a word, look at the results, not the process."" 
David Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project and a fellow of the Robert Bosch Academy in Berlin, said while it was difficult to quantify the extent of negative sentiment, the intensity of the online censorship reflected the level of dissent.
China's internet censors, trigger-happy at the best of times, have gone into overdrive to sanitize discussion of the term limit changes.
Deleted and blocked posts on China's Twitter-like Weibo include references to ""lifelong"", ""emigration"" and emperors ""ascending the throne"", as well as widely shared memes of Winnie the Pooh, who some consider to bear a resemblance to Xi, clinging to a pot of honey.
Even the letter 'n', which in colloquial Chinese can mean ""many"" or ""countless"", was also momentarily blocked on Weibo.
""This displays a level of absurdity and paranoia that would seem to suggest China's leaders themselves understand the criticism is there, and that it is sufficiently intense to be a threat,"" Bandurski said.

1139,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 08:54AM ET</span>",Russia says to retaliate soon for UK's expulsion of diplomats over nerve attack,"By Denis Pinchuk and Guy Faulconbridge
MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday it would retaliate very soon for Britain's expulsion of 23 diplomats as Moscow and London traded public insults about a nerve toxin attack on a former Russian double agent in England.
After the first known use of a military-grade nerve toxin on British soil since World War Two, the United States, France, NATO and the European Union gave verbal support to May, though it remained unclear what action the West would take.
London says the Russian state is responsible for trying to kill Sergei Skripal - a former Russian intelligence officer who betrayed dozens of agents to Britain's MI6 - with Novichok, a lethal nerve agent developed by the Soviet military. 
Russia denied any involvement and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused London of behaving in a ""boorish"" way, adding that this was partly due to the problems Britain faces over its planned exit from the European Union next year.
Lavrov said Russia's response would come ""very soon"" but be conveyed to British officials first, an apparent contradiction of an earlier report by state news agency RIA that said Lavrov had promised to expel British diplomats.
In the biggest expulsion of Russian diplomats from London since the Cold War, Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday gave 23 Russians who she said were spies working under diplomatic cover a week to leave London. 
""The temperature of Russian-British relations drops to minus 23 but we are not afraid of the cold weather,"" Russia's embassy in London said beside the picture of a thermometer surrounded by ice and reading minus 23 degrees Celsius.
Skripal and his daughter Yulia have been critically ill since they were found unconscious on a bench in the southern English city of Salisbury on March 4. A British policeman who was also poisoned is in a serious but stable condition. 
May on Thursday visited the normally genteel city where police investigators in chemical protection suits and the army have been removing evidence of the poisoning. 
Britain also said it would invest 48 million pounds ($67 million) in a new chemical warfare defense center at its Porton Down military research laboratory, where scientists identified the nerve agent used against Skripal.
WESTERN RESPONSE?
Britain's allies expressed solidarity over the attack.
The White House said it shared Britain's assessment that Russia was responsible and supported the decision to expel Russian diplomats.
France, which on Wednesday had said it wanted proof of Russian involvement before deciding whether to take action against Moscow, swung behind Britain on Thursday.
""France agrees with the United Kingdom that there is no other plausible explanation and reiterates its solidarity with its ally,"" President Emmanuel Macron's office said in a statement.
Macron later told reporters he would decide in the coming days what measures France would take against Russia over the attack.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the attack in Britain was part of a pattern of reckless behavior from Russia over many years. He said Britain could count on NATO's solidarity, but said there had been no request by London to activate the alliance's mutual defense clause.
In London, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson ratcheted up the rhetoric against Russia, accusing it of glorying in the attack on Skripal, which he described as a way of scaring anyone who stood up to President Vladimir Putin.
""There is something in the kind of smug, sarcastic response that we've heard from the Russians that to me betokens their fundamental guilt,"" he told the BBC. ""They want to simultaneously deny it and yet at the same time to glory in it.""
Johnson defended the government's response to the attack against critics who said it did not go far enough. He suggested the authorities might also go after assets held in Britain by Russians close to Putin, though he gave no specific details.
His opposite number in Moscow, Lavrov, suggested that one possible motive for the poisoning was to complicate Russia's hosting of this summer's soccer World Cup.
Lavrov also said he hoped Skripal recovered from the attack so that he could shed light on what happened.

The diplomatic rift comes on the eve of a Russian presidential election on Sunday that is expected to extend Putin's rule by a further six years. Putin, in power since 2000, casts himself as a strong leader who stands up to Russia's enemies in the West.

Hawking, who died in England on Wednesday, was the top trending topic on China's Twitter-like microblog Weibo at one point, with ordinary people and celebrities alike bidding farewell to the author of ""A Brief History of Time"".
""May Hawking now run freely in the universe that he had explored,"" a Weibo user wrote in a post. 
The People's Daily, the mouthpiece of China's ruling Communist Party, wrote on Weibo telling its 56.5 million followers to reflect on some of Hawking's quotes on science and life. 
The newspaper also remarked at the coincidence that Hawking was born on the 300th anniversary of Galileo's death and died on Einstein's birthday. 
""One less star on earth, one more star in the sky,"" another Weibo post said.
Hawking was followed by more than 4.7 million people on Weibo, China's biggest social media platform. His posts, while infrequent, were widely discussed and shared. 
In an oft-quoted post in 2016, Hawking wished all Chinese students taking the all-important annual university entrance exam best of luck, describing them as ""the next generation of scientific minds"". 
Hawking himself had been a subject of countless essays by Chinese students on who had inspired them the most. 
Hawking, who visited the Great Wall on one of his few trips to China despite being ravaged by a wasting motor neuron disease, had professed a deep appreciation for Chinese culture and customs, as well as its youth. 
Professor Liu Bing at Tsinghua University recalled meeting Hawking in 1985. 
""At that time, Hawking was not famous yet, and ""The History of Time"" had not been published. But the state of his physique left a deep impression on me, so I sought out an opportunity to take a photo with him,"" Liu said. 
China's foreign ministry, in its daily press briefing on Wednesday, took time out to pay tribute to Hawking, describing him as a ""remarkable scientist"" and a ""fighter"".
Riding on the wave of sentiment, some merchants on popular online marketplace Taobao started to sell commemorative sweatshirts for 79 yuan ($12.52) a piece. 
Some bookstores in Beijing also reported a surge in inquiries on ""A Brief History of Time"".

1142,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 03:50AM ET</span>",Japan's 'sontaku' clouds where the buck stops in school scandal,"By Linda Sieg
TOKYO (Reuters) - Figuring out who is to blame in a widening political scandal that threatens Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is being complicated by a practice known as ""sontaku"", which loosely translates as ""following unspoken orders"".
Abe and Finance Minister Taro Aso are under fire after the ministry released altered documents related to the discounted sale of state-owned land to a school operator with ties to Abe's wife, raising the possibility of a cover-up.
Abe has denied wrongdoing by himself or his wife and Aso has denied instructing any cover-up.
Strictly speaking, that could be true if the officials involved in the land deal and altering the related documents engaged in ""sontaku"", by attempting to surmise their superiors' wishes and acting without explicit directions.
""The invoking of implicit expectations is a wonderful way to shirk responsibility,"" said Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University's Japan campus.
""Superiors can say, 'I didn't order it,' and those lower down can say, 'I'm following orders,' so the buck stops nowhere.""
WHAT IS ""SONTAKU""?
The word's original meaning is to ""conjecture, surmise or speculate"" and it has been around a long time, though rarely used in ordinary conversation.
The term appeared in a passage of ancient Chinese poetry and originally meant the ability to see through someone's evil purposes, the Asahi newspaper said.
When octogenarian Emperor Akihito in 2016 said publicly he feared his age and health would make it hard to fulfill his duties and mentioned the year 2018, listeners ""surmised"" he wanted to abdicate this year. There was no negative connotation.
Last year, however, ""sontaku"" entered the spotlight after the scandal broke over the land sale to the school operator, whose head at the time, Yasunori Kagoike, told reporters he did not think there had been direct peddling of influence, but rather ""sontaku"". 
Chosen as ""word of the year"" by two publishers last year, ""sontaku"" has acquired a more negative connotation because of its link to the scandal.
WHY DOES ""SONTAKU"" MATTER?
If officials who signed off on the deal or altered related documents were engaging in ""sontaku"", it could be hard to prove their superiors did anything wrong, at least in legal terms.
""Abe is a strong leader, so bureaucrats, without being ordered directly, did various things - dishonest and maybe illegal,"" said a ruling coalition lawmaker who declined to be identified speaking on a sensitive topic. 
""But as long as Abe gave no direct order, this will end as 'sontaku',"" he said. ""There is a difference between legal, political and ethical responsibility.""
Aso is under pressure to quit, however, even if he gave no direct order, as he oversees the ministry. 
Whether Abe wins a third term as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party in September, or is forced to step down sooner, will depend on whether, and how far, his support falls.
IS ""SONTAKU"" JUST JAPANESE?
The Abe government's tight control of top appointments may have boosted the incentive for bureaucrats to engage in ""sontaku"", although employees everywhere try to anticipate their bosses' wishes.
""It's not something unfamiliar to people working anywhere else who want to get ahead and curry favor with those above,"" Kingston said.

""But in Japan, it's developed to a higher art form.""

1143,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 04:02AM ET</span>",Lawyers for Vatican treasurer question accusers in Australian court,"(Note: Language in paragraph 14 that might offend some readers)
By Sonali Paul
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Lawyers for Vatican treasurer Cardinal George Pell questioned family members of two of his accusers during a second day of open testimony in a pre-trial hearing into charges of historical sexual offences in an Australian court on Thursday.
Australian-born Pell, 76, a top adviser to Pope Francis, was summoned by police last year and is the most senior Catholic official to face such charges. Details of the charges have not been made public.
Pell's lawyers have said at previous administrative hearings he will plead not guilty to all charges. Pell is not required to enter a formal plea unless a magistrate determines there is cause for a full trial.
His lawyer, Robert Richter, questioned the fathers and a brother of two of his accusers about statements they had given to police about when and where certain events were alleged to have taken place and when they became aware of them.
The court was told the father of one of the accusers never identified Pell in his statement to police and that he had first heard about the possibility his son might have been sexually abused in July 2015, long after the events were alleged to have taken place.
""Did you ask whether he was abused by Father Pell?"" Richter asked the father, who cannot be identified because that would identify one of the alleged victims.
The father replied: ""I cannot remember the details. I was more concerned about the fact that he had been abused by priests.""
He said neither he nor anyone in his family had seen anything improper at the alleged location of the abuse, where their local church had hosted a water-skiing outing.
Pressed on whether anyone had seen anything ""untoward"", he said he didn't know what Richter was getting at.
""Improper. Sexual. Abusive,"" Richter said, to which the father replied: ""No.""
The father and brother of another accuser said they first heard about the alleged abuse in mid-2015, about a month before they were questioned by police about accusations against Pell.
The second father said he could not recall any occasion when his son had behaved oddly after being around priests.
The father's younger son said his brother had made allegations about an earlier incident. 
The younger son recalled driving his brother home from a family party and hearing his brother, who was drunk, say: ""Some fucked up stuff has happened to me.""
The hearing in the southern city of Melbourne was later adjourned until Monday by Magistrate Belinda Wallington over a matter unrelated to Pell's case.
The court was closed to the public for most of the first 10 days of the hearing to protect the privacy of people giving evidence.
The hearing to determine whether there is enough evidence to go to trial is scheduled to continue until the end of March.
Pell is on a leave of absence from his Vatican role as Francis' economy minister, which he started in 2014. The pontiff has said he will not comment on the case until it is over.

The announcement to withdraw comes five weeks after a court prosecutor said a preliminary examination had been opened into President Rodrigo Duterte's deadly war on drugs, to look into whether crimes against humanity had been committed.
But according to Duterte's spokesman, Harry Roque, that examination ""violates the very fundamental basis by which we gave our consent to be bound by the ICC"".
ICC prosecutors have yet to comment on the announcement.
In a statement released on Wednesday, Duterte said U.N. special rapporteurs were trying to ""paint me as a ruthless and heartless violator of human right"", and the ICC had acted prematurely and created the impression he would be charged with serious crimes.
Roque said Duterte believes there is a ""conspiracy"" among lobby groups and the United Nations, to which he said the ICC is perceived to be allied, and wants to indict him ""in the court of public opinion"".
""The ICC has lost a strong ally in Asia,"" Roque told a media briefing.
""No new countries will join because we are recognized as probably the number one defender of human rights and democracy in the world,"" added Roque, a lawyer and prominent advocate for the Philippines joining the ICC in 2011.
Duterte's opponents wasted no time in accusing him of flip-flopping, pointing out that he had repeatedly dared the ICC to indict him and said he would ""rot in jail"" to defend a war on drugs during which police have killed thousands of people.
They said Duterte's decision was an admission of guilt and a sign that he was panicking.
Human rights and jurist groups condemned him for what they saw as an attempt to evade justice and accountability, and said a withdrawal was pointless, because jurisdiction applied retroactively, for the period of membership.
In an interview with ANC news channel early on Thursday, Roque warned of an ""avalanche of other states leaving"".
""This is the beginning of the end of the court,"" he said, adding that the ICC would have no jurisdiction over the Philippines, and it was unlikely Duterte would ever be handed over to the court.
Presidential legal counsel Salvador Panelo said Duterte felt the ICC had become ""a tool of oppression, a tool of harassment"".

Jude Sabio, the lawyer who filed the ICC complaint last year, told ANC that the issue of an arrest warrant for the president would be a ""big triumph of justice"".

1145,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 04:09AM ET</span>",Hong Kong's judges voice fears over China influence in judiciary,"By Greg Torode and James Pomfret
HONG KONG (Reuters) - As Hong Kong's judges and senior lawyers paraded in ceremonial wigs and gowns on Jan 8 to mark the start of the legal year, anxieties over China's growing reach into the city's vaunted legal system swirled with the wintry winds.
At a private cocktail reception with leading judges before the event, one of the topics of discussion was concerns over Beijing's influence in the judiciary, according to one participant who requested anonymity.
Hong Kong's judges are increasingly expressing such fears in private, concerned that interpretations and amendments from China's parliament could soon force them to curb the city's freedoms, according to interviews with four veteran judges, as well as with sources close to several others.
The judges interviewed said that while they believe the independence and integrity of the judiciary remains intact, such interpretations could effectively mean Beijing is telling them what to do, limiting their authority on key political and security issues. 
""We know Beijing has their own fears"" over Hong Kong, said one judge, a veteran of Hong Kong under both British and Chinese rule. ""But if they interpret too frequently, the risk is they will leave us nothing left on which to rule.""
Such remarks are highly rare from Hong Kong judges, who tend to be cautious and are prevented by convention from publicly raising political issues. 
Hong Kong's rule of law is widely seen as a cornerstone of the former British colony's international reputation as a business hub, key to protecting its autonomy from a Communist Party leadership wanting greater control. 
Any erosion of that reputation could undermine Hong Kong's relative attractiveness as a business center for investors compared to mainland Chinese cities like Shanghai or Shenzhen, or regional rival Singapore. 
Neighboring Macau too has been facing such pressures.
China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, which is overseen by China's cabinet, the State Council, did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters.
Hong Kong's legal and social freedoms are far greater than those that exist across mainland China. And, like Hong Kong's separate legal traditions that are based on common law, they are detailed in a mini-constitution known as the Basic Law under a ""one country, two systems"" formula. 
While Beijing's leaders publicly say they respect Hong Kong's rule of law as part of its high degree of autonomy, some judges and lawyers remain skeptical.
""There is a marked climate of unease among my peers"" that ""wasn't there a few years ago,"" said a second judge.
With the prospect of President Xi Jinping ruling China indefinitely following the scrapping of term limits this month, anxieties have resurfaced over his stance towards Hong Kong.
In a landmark speech in the city last June, Xi warned that Beijing would brook no challenge to its authority. In previous speeches he has suggested a blurring of the separation of powers between the government and judiciary in Hong Kong. 
For some, the situation highlights an awkward contradiction within the Basic Law: even as it guarantees Hong Kong's judicial independence, the document still grants final power of interpretation to a committee of the National People's Congress, China's parliament.
That puts the parliament beyond Hong Kong's top Court of Final Appeal, a body that includes leading jurists from Britain, Australia and other common law jurisdictions.
Some judges have also expressed concern to Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma, according to people familiar with the situation.
""They use the constitution as a protector of their rule, not as a protector of civil rights,"" said Audrey Eu, a senior barrister and former democratic politician, referring to Beijing. ""They can interpret it any way they like.""
JUDGES ""TRAPPED""
""The judges see themselves as trapped,"" said one diplomat close to the situation. ""They might be independent as ever, but the National People's Congress in Beijing is not independent and they will have to increasingly implement party diktat."" 
Asian and Western envoys are watching closely, with some describing Hong Kong's legal system as the one institution that Beijing has yet to fully penetrate, unlike other spheres like politics, academia and the media.
Hong Kong corporate lawyers say international clients such as hedge funds are now questioning the city's legal future and potential role of Beijing. In contracts, some are stipulating that Singapore be used as a host for any arbitration, they say.
Kevin Yam, a commercial lawyer and media columnist, said that even if interpretations were political rather than commercial, ""the perceptions created by them could still lead to much more work needed to be done to convince international investors that Hong Kong's rule of law is largely intact."" 
A U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission report last November noted the importance of the link between Hong Kong's strong rule of law and economic openness.
During the commission's trip to Hong Kong last May, observers ""noted the risk for Hong Kong's continued importance as Asia's financial center if companies and individuals lose confidence in Hong Kong's rule of law and other freedoms as they are eroded by Beijing,"" the congressional report stated.
Beijing's power of interpretation has been sparingly used since Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997. The last interpretation, in November 2016, was made preemptively ahead of a local court hearing to effectively bar pro-democracy lawmakers who had mocked their oath taking.
The prospect of tougher national security laws, a crackdown on an independence movement and a plan to give mainland security personnel legal control of a local rail platform could all spark legal challenges, and risk interpretations as Beijing seeks greater control.
Some judges and lawyers said that when Beijing issued its first interpretation in 1999, it was seen as a last resort. The threshold is now far lower, they fear.
CERTAINTY OF JUDGMENTS
Elsie Leung, a lawyer who served for eight years as Hong Kong's first justice secretary after the handover, acknowledged those fears but said the system is working well and Beijing is entitled to interpret where it sees necessary.
When asked whether Beijing had grown more confident about exercising its Basic Law powers, even preemptively, she said ""now, after the accumulation of all their experience they are able to do things more expeditiously"".
But Leung, who serves on the NPC's Basic Law Committee, added that ""the rule of law and judicial independence are well protected under the Basic Law"" and that interpretations would still be made sparingly.
She added that Beijing needed certainty on key judgments that it felt affected national sovereignty, saying such matters were ""in the interests of any government"".
LEGAL APPOINTMENTS 
When he opened the legal year, Chief Justice Ma didn't directly address fears of pressures from Beijing but repeatedly stressed the importance of common law.
""It is regarded as vital to the continuing success of Hong Kong not only from financial or business points of view, but also everyone in the community as a whole,"" he said.
When asked later by Reuters about judges' fears of interference from Beijing, he skirted the issue but stressed the ""professionalism"" of the Hong Kong judiciary.
The main pressures on them, he said, was ""that they act in accordance with the law and to get it right"".
As well as making judgments, Ma heads a body that oversees judicial promotions and appointments, making recommendations to Hong Kong's chief executive.
By convention, those recommendations are always accepted. But the chief executive maintains veto power.
Some judges, and those close to them, see that veto power as a potential weak point should Beijing lean on the Hong Kong government to exert greater control.
""So far the system works and we are left alone,"" said one committee member, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""And we all want to ensure that continues."" The committee member added: ""It would be truly shocking for the government to meddle with us.""

A spokesman for the judiciary said Ma would not comment on written questions submitted by Reuters.

The spokesman did not give a reason for the decision. On Wednesday, Cavusoglu said he hoped to build good relations with new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo but he must respect Turkey, amid deep tensions over Syria policy and other issues.
Turkey has been angered by Washington's support for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia in the fight against Islamic State. Turkey sees the YPG as a terrorist group and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
There had been signs of an easing in strains between the NATO allies after a recent visit to Turkey by Tillerson, whom U.S. President Donald Trump sacked on Tuesday as secretary of state.
But Turkish media has seized on a tweet purportedly made by Pompeo after a failed coup in July 2016 - and before he became CIA director - which referred to Turkey as a ""totalitarian Islamist dictatorship"". The tweet was later removed.

Turkey has been angered by the U.S. failure to extradite the Pennsylvania-based cleric Ankara whom blames for orchestrating that attempted putsch and by the conviction of a Turkish banker in an Iran sanctions-busting case.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A scion of Thailand's biggest autoparts group launched a political party in Bangkok on Thursday as an alternative to established parties, promising to bridge a festering political divide.
Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, 39, executive vice president and director of the Thai Summit Group launched the Future Forward Party in a part of Bangkok's old Chinatown being revived with hip shops, restaurants and galleries.
Thanathorn said he hoped to appeal to younger voters and disenfranchised citizens.
""Give democracy a chance,"" the graduate of New York University Stern School of Business said in English at the launch.
""We don't need governance through guns,"" he added in Thai, referring to the ruling military, which took power in 2014.
The launch comes two weeks after Thailand's Election Commission opened registration for new parties, one of the first signs of a tentative return to democracy. 
Thailand has been under military rule since a 2014 coup toppled an elected government.
Since the coup, the generals have banned political activity. They have also repeatedly delayed a general election with the latest date February 2019.
The country has been largely divided since a 2006 coup against then Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a businessman turned politician who gained a loyal following among rural voters but made enemies among the military-royalist elite.
The military's intervention in 2014 was to topple a civilian government led by Thaksin's sister, Yingluck Shinawatra.
Thanathorn's uncle, Suriya Juangroongruangkit, held various senior positions in an earlier incarnation of Thaksin's political machine, the Thai Rak Thai Party, and the youthful Thanathorn has been described by some as the ""next Thaksin"".
But on Thursday he dismissed any suggestion of links to the self-exiled former telecommunications tycoon, saying he did not side with any existing group.
""We have our own stance,"" he said. 
NEW GENERATION
A member of the Thaksin-backed Puea Thai party welcomed Thanathorn's party as an alternative to old military-aligned parties for voters ""sick and tired"" of dictatorship.
""These voters may not want to vote Puea Thai but vote for this new party instead, which would be useful because they would be taking votes away from those that support dictatorship,"" Watana Muangsook, a Puea Thai Party member, told Reuters.
Yuttaporn Issarachai, a political science lecturer at the Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University said the new party might attract a respectable number of voters from a new generation.
""It could be a mid-size party appealing to voters aged 18 to 25,"" Yuttaporn told Reuters.
Critics of the junta say it has failed to deliver on its promises and that political divisions endure, while impatience with the stalled return to democracy grows.
Activists have defied a ban on gatherings to organize small protests while Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, 63, who as army chief led the 2014 coup, appears to be embarking on his own campaign to stay on as prime minister.
Thanathorn, whose family also has a major stake in the newspaper publisher Matichon Pcl, resigned from the board of that company on Wednesday but remains on the board of privately held Thai Summit.
Thanatorn did not list any party policies because formal political campaigning is still banned.
Among party co-founders he introduced were a film-maker and several gay rights and environmental activists.
Thanathorn said he hoped to win the support of ""ordinary people"".
""People who are not famous ... but who want to shape our country's future together,"" he said.

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 01:44AM ET</span>",India eying Boeing's Super Hornet in latest twist to air force procurement,"By Sanjeev Miglani and Jamie Freed
NEW DELHI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, considered the frontrunner in the race to supply the Indian navy with new fighter jets, is now in contention for a much bigger $15 billion order after the government abruptly asked the air force to consider the twin-engine planes.
Until recently,  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Corp's F-16 and Saab AB's Gripen were in a two-horse race supply at least 100 single-engine jets to build up the Indian Air Force's fast-depleting combat fleet.
Both had offered to build the planes in India in collaboration with local companies as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's drive to build a domestic industrial base and cut back on arms imports.
But last month the government asked the air force to open up the competition to twin-engine aircraft and to evaluate Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet, a defense ministry source said. That jet is a finalist for the Indian navy's $8 billion to $9 billion contract for 57 fighters.
The defense ministry plans to within weeks issue a request for information (RFI), the first stage of a procurement process, for a fighter to be built in India. The competition will be open to both single and twin-engine jets, the official said, but both Lockheed and Saab said they had not been informed about the new requirements.
The latest change of heart is a major opportunity for Boeing, whose only foreign Super Hornet customer so far is the Royal Australian Air Force. 
It also illustrates how dysfunctional the weapons procurement process and arms industry are in the world’s second-most-populous country. The need for new fighters has been known for nearly 15 years, but after many announcements, twists and turns, the country’s air force has only three-quarters of the aircraft it needs.
An indigenous light combat aircraft, the Tejas, is still not operational, 35 years after it was first proposed.   
An Indian Air Force source said fighter procurement was urgent: the branch's operational strength has fallen to just 33 squadrons, its weakest level in four decades, as it decommissions Soviet-era MiG-21s. 
""The IAF wants the RFI issued within weeks and get the process started,"" said the source, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media. ""The problem is that government keeps shifting what it wants.""
A PRESSING NEED
Over the next decade, 13 more squadrons will be retired as their aircraft age out of service, parliament's standing committee on defense said in a December report.
The defense ministry declined to comment on the air force's aircraft modernization program, saying it was not in a position to do so. 
Lockheed, which had offered to shift its F-16 production line in Fort Worth, Texas, to India, said it had not been told of any change to the Indian plan for single-engine fighters. 
""Our proposed F-16 partnership with India stands firm,"" the company said in an email. Last year it picked Tata Advanced Systems as its local partner and said it was in talks with dozens of firms to build up the supplier network. 
""The Government of India has not yet issued formal requirements but we are continuing to support government-to-government discussions and engage with Indian companies about F-16 industrial opportunities,"" Lockheed said.
Sweden's Saab was also caught off guard. 
""We have seen the reports in the Indian media, but no new formal communication has been made to us regarding the fighter program,"" said Rob Hewson, Saab Asia Pacific's head of communications. 
France's Dassault Systemes SE's Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon and Russian aircraft are also potential contenders under the new requirements, the air force source and industry analysts said. 
Admiral Harry Harris, the head of U.S. Pacific Command, told the U.S. House Armed Services Committee last month that India was considering the stealthy F-35, among other options. But the Indian air force said no request had been made to Lockheed for even a briefing on the aircraft. 
An order the size of India's is rare. The only comparable opportunity for the Super Hornet is Canada's request for 88 fighters, which could be worth as much as $14.6 billion.
The Indian air force competition has echoes of a 2007 tender for 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft, for which Dassault was selected for exclusive negotiations. But the talks quickly bogged down over local production and prices, and in the end, the government ordered just 36 Rafales in 2016 for $8.7 billion. 
LOCAL FIGHTER
The air force ideally would like a combination of lighter single-engine and twin-engine jets, as well as stealthy aircraft, but cannot afford such a range of foreign systems, analysts said.
A twin-engine foreign fighter would perhaps offer the best value while the Tejas finishes development, they said.
India's annual defense capital procurement budget of $14 billion to $15 billion has to be spread over the army, navy, air force and the indigenous defense research organization.  
""The operational costs are going up with increased manpower, higher wages and general inflation. Ministry of Defence doesn’t have the luxury to go for too many platforms despite the rapidly falling squadron strength of the air force,"" said Amber Dubey, partner and India head of aerospace and defense at global consultancy KPMG.
Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar said the company was ready to respond to any request from the air force.
""We will follow the MoD’s lead on their process and will be responsive to their needs if we are asked to provide any information,"" he said.
Kumar said Boeing was committed to building the planes in India and had offered to help with India's plans to develop its own advanced medium combat aircraft.
But the experience with the Rafale contract has made experts skeptical that the latest tender will proceed as planned.
Richard A. Bitzinger, visiting senior fellow at Singapore's S.Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said he did not expect a resolution in even the next two to three years.
""I am never surprised by what the Indians do when it comes to their procurement tenders. They are constantly changing the rules, changing their minds, and often even cancelling orders mid-way through,"" he said.

""The Indians have a remarkable knack for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - China's President Xi Jinping offered encouragement for South Korea's initiative to nurture peaceful engagement with North Korea, and Russia also expressed support, the South Korean official leading diplomatic efforts said on Thursday.
During the past week, National Security Office head Chung Eui-yong briefed officials in Beijing and Moscow following his dramatic success in arranging summits between the North Korean, South Korean and U.S. leaders.
""Xi Jinping offered a Chinese phrase that says 'once hard ice melts, spring comes and flowers bloom' to describe the situation on the Korean peninsula and expressed his willingness to support the current situation,"" Chung told reporters on his return to Incheon International Airport.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told the South Korean delegation led by Chung that he was open to addressing denuclearizing with the United States, an offer that led to U.S. President Trump agreeing to meet Kim for a summit expected to happen sometime in May.
There was growing speculation on Thursday that Trump and Kim will meet Sweden, after its foreign ministry announced North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho was arriving imminently for two days of talks with his Swedish counterpart, Margot Wallstrom.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in is set to hold a summit with the North's Kim by the end of April. 
The South's preparation committee for the inter-Korean summit, led by Moon's chief of staff Im Jong-seok, will hold its first official meeting on Friday, presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom told a briefing.
The committee is comprised of presidential and government officials including the ministers of unification, foreign affairs and defense, Kim said.
Separately, a South Korean official said it was too early to discuss joint economic projects with Pyongyang.
The same official said China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi would visit Seoul on Tuesday for talks with South Korean security officials. 
TRAVELING DIPLOMATS
The flurry of diplomatic activity comes after a year-long verbal spat between Kim Jong Un and Trump, with tensions exacerbated by multiple missile and nuclear tests by the North which has said it will forge on with its nuclear program to protect its regime.
""China and Russia agreed to continue cooperation to uphold the peace that has been created, as well as the momentum for stability through close communication,"" Chung said.
North Korea has friendly ties with both Beijing and Moscow, and China is by far its biggest trading partner.
Pyongyang has remained silent over its agreement for the summits since Chung returned from the North, although officials in Seoul have said they expect to continue working talks soon to work out details for the inter-Korean summit.
Ri's sudden visit to Sweden spurred talk that the summit could take place there. Sweden's embassy in Pyongyang represents U.S. diplomatic interests in North Korea in the absence of U.S. diplomatic relations with the country.

It said a new government would be in place before mid-May, suggesting that the election date could be set for the end of April or early May.
Analysts and ruling party sources told Reuters this week Prime Minister Najib Razak was confident of an election victory and that polls could be called for as early as April.
The term of the current government ends on June 24.
Najib's government has been tainted by scandal, particularly over a state-run investment fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
The scandal has brought unprecedented shifts in political forces in Malaysia, where the rule of a party that has held power since Malaysia's independence from Britain in 1957 could be under threat.

Former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, who helped found the ruling United Malays National Organisation, and his opposition alliance have emerged as a major challenger to Najib, who denies any wrongdoing over 1MDB.

RABAT (Reuters) - Moroccan protesters on Wednesday clashed with security forces in a poor mining town where residents have been demanding government help to tackle poverty, officials and activists said.
The town of Jerada in the remote northeast has seen protests since two artisan miners were killed in an accident in December but demonstrations calling for state aid and alternative jobs had remained peaceful until now.
On Wednesday, protesters set five police cars on fire and clashed with police, a local official said. An unspecified number of policemen were wounded and brought to a hospital in Oujda, the main city in the northeast, a statement said.
Nine persons had been detained, officials said. 
An activist in Jerada said residents had staged a sit-in against a statement by interior ministry on Tuesday that had warned it was ready to act decisively unless the protests stopped.
Security forces fired teargas, according to a video posted on social media purportedly showing the clashes.
Some 500 security had surrounded the protest which had led to the violence, the activist said by phone, asking not to be named.
Residents say the town has been neglected since the mines closed some 20 years ago, part of growing public dissatisfaction in some poor areas at a time when the government is implementing currency reforms and cutting subsidies to drive economic growth.
The Jerada protests have found common cause with dissent that has rumbled since 2016 in the Rif, also in the north and making economic and political demands.
They are a far cry from the mass protests which rocked the North African country in 2011 when uprisings ousted rulers in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, but pose a challenge to a constitutional monarchy in which the king has far-reaching powers.
Stability in Morocco is important for Western governments as it is the only country in North Africa where jihadist groups have failed to gain a foothold. Rabat is also a key intelligence-sharing partner on Islamist militancy.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Almost a decade ago, Lee Eun-eui was thrust into a lonely battle against her employer Samsung (KS:005930) after she reported unwelcome touching by a superior.
Shamed by her supervisors and sidelined by her colleagues, Lee’s career as an international sales representative at the company stagnated. 
“No one will be on your side,” Lee says her boss told her. 
After two years, Lee won a lawsuit against her employer  Samsung Electro-Mechanics  Co Ltd (KS:009150), prevailing against part of a conglomerate so large and powerful in South Korea that the country is often referred to as the “Republic of Samsung”.
Lee has since built a new career as a lawyer helping other South Korean women with sex abuse cases. 
Haunted by her colleagues' silence, Lee hopes the #MeToo movement now sweeping the country will inspire more people to stand up for women who might otherwise experience the shame and silence she faced. 
“What people need to think about now amid the #MeToo movement is emphasizing with those #MeToo stories that are not personally related to them,” Lee said.
LONG LEGAL BATTLE
After sluggish start, the global #MeToo movement has gathered pace in South Korea, leading to accusations in recent weeks of sexual assault and harassment against prominent politicians, entertainers and religious figures.
Seoul has since vowed to strengthen laws against sexual assault and implement measures to reduce harassment. 
Lee's personal battle began in 2005 when she reported the abuse to her human resources department, only to be ostracized.
In desperation, she filed a complaint to Samsung’s chairman Lee Kun-hee. Lee says the Samsung chairman did not respond.
""If I was a little bit weaker mentally, I would have jumped off the building at Taepyung Street,"" Lee said of Samsung's then headquarters. 
In 2008, Lee filed a civil lawsuit alleging her employer did not do enough to protect her while inflicting mental pain on her.
The Suwon District Court ruled in her favor in 2010 and ordered Samsung Elec-Mech to pay her around 40 million won ($37,460) in damages.
""Although the plaintiff was sexually harassed at work, the defendant Samsung Electro-Mechanics did not take an appropriate measure and even put her at a disadvantage. Therefore, it is clear that this inflicted mental pain on the plaintiff,"" the court verdict said. 
Samsung Elec-Mech did not comment after the case and declined comment when contacted by Reuters for this story.
Lee thinks her case did lead to needed reforms at Samsung, which did not appeal the verdict and has since treated sex abuse cases more fairly, according to Lee, citing feedback from her former colleagues.
""Samsung is very sensitive about problems they have experienced,"" she said. ""I think we have both grown up by confronting each other."" 
""I HAVE BEEN THERE""
Other lawyers supporting victims say there have been improvements with South Korea's handling of sexual abuse cases to better help those seeking justice in the courtroom. 
""In the legal realm, courts have recently begun to accept victims’ testimonies as direct evidence rather than circumstantial evidence if those testimonies are detailed and consistent,"" said Kim Soo-jin, an attorney from the Korean Women Lawyers Association.
Lee has been offering free legal help for victims of sexual violence since 2015, as part of a South Korean government's programme to support the victims. She says many are still hesitant to take their cases to the court. 
""Office workers are still afraid of talking about their stories publicly... There are many loopholes where companies can take minimal actions and get away from it,"" Lee said.

""It is not victims' preference to come out and talk. They are desperate. I know, because I have been there.""

The so-called Panama Papers, which consist of millions of documents stolen from Mossack Fonseca and leaked to the media in April 2016, provoked a global scandal after showing how the rich and powerful used offshore corporations to evade taxes.
""The reputational deterioration, the media campaign, the financial circus and the unusual actions by certain Panamanian authorities, have occasioned an irreversible damage that necessitates the obligatory ceasing of public operations at the end of the current month,"" the firm said in a statement. 
Mossack Fonseca said a skeleton staff would remain in order to comply with requests from authorities and other public and private groups. 
Nonetheless, the law firm said it would continue ""fighting for justice,"" adding it would continue to cooperate with authorities. 
Last month, Panamanian prosecutors raided the offices of Mossack Fonseca, seeking possible links to Brazilian engineering company Odebrecht. The Brazilian construction firm has admitted to bribing officials in Panama and other countries to obtain contracts in the region between 2010 and 2014.
Ramon Fonseca, a partner at Mossack Fonseca, denied last month that his firm had a connection to Odebrecht, while accusing Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela of directly receiving money from Odebrecht, Latin America's largest engineering company.

LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar resigned late on Wednesday, hours after a key investment project hit a legal obstacle, saying he had also had enough of obstruction from his coalition partners and pressure from trade unions.
The move comes less then three months ahead of general election which was expected in June. It was not clear whether Cerar's resignation would bring the election forward.
In pre-election opinion polls Cerar's centre-left Party of Modern Centre is trailing behind three other parties with a centre-left List of Marjan Sarec, which has never before run for parliament, being in the lead ahead of the opposition centre-right Slovenian Democratic Party.
Cerar said he would step down in the wake of a Supreme Court decision to annul the result of a September referendum that approved a 1-billion-euro railway project, the centre-left government's biggest investment programme.
""The (railway project) took a new blow from those who want to stop the positive development of Slovenia,"" he said. ""I don't want to be part of such stories.""
Earlier on Wednesday, teachers held their second one-day strike for higher wages. A number of other public sector employees are also demanding hefty pay hikes.
""Demands and suggestions have been becoming less and less feasible and even damaging to the state,"" Cerar said.
He told a news conference that coalition partners had been trying for a long time to undermine projects, without naming specific parties or programmes. He said he would keep the post until a new government was formed.
The government coalition, which took power in September 2014, includes Cerar's Party of Modern Centre, the Social Democrats and pensioners' party Desus.
The government had said joint public sector trade union demands amount to almost 1 billion euros ($1.24 billion), were not justified by productivity and GDP growth and would threaten planned fiscal consolidation. 
Slovenia, which narrowly avoided an international bailout for its banks in 2013, returned to growth a year later. The government expects economic growth of at least 3.9 percent this year versus 5 percent in 2017, boosted by exports and investments.
It hopes to end 2018 with a budget surplus of some 0.4 percent versus a deficit of 0.8 percent last year.

ROME (Reuters) - The leader of Italy's eurosceptic League said on Wednesday a government deal with the anti-system 5-Star Movement was possible after an inconclusive election, raising the prospect of two radical groups running the country. 
The March 4 vote ended in gridlock, with 5-Star and the League emerging as the top two parties in parliament, but no bloc or group securing a majority to govern alone.
Italy's head of state is due to start consultations next month to try to end the stalemate in the euro zone's third largest economy, with the various parties positioning themselves for potentially fraught and lengthy negotiations.
""Barring the PD, everything is possible,"" League leader Matteo Salvini told reporters, referring to the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), which was defeated after a difficult five years in office spent trying to revive the sluggish economy.
The PD itself has pledged to move to opposition ranks.
5-Star, born as a protest movement in 2009, long resisted any suggestion of forming alliances, but its leader Luigi Di Maio said on Wednesday that it now wants to talk to other parties to fix a common programme.
""Before we talk about who, let's talk about what, let's pursue a programme centred on the people outside the corridors of power,"" he said at a business association event in Milan. 
Salvini's overture to the 5-Star is anathema to his coalition partner, four-time prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party trailed the League in the election and now plays second fiddle in their conservative bloc.
EURO HOSTILITY
Berlusconi, who has branded 5-Star a ""dangerous sect"", said on Wednesday he wanted a minority centre-right government ""with support from the PD on individual measures"", Forza Italia Senator Luigi Vitale told reporters after a party meeting. 
Berlusconi acknowledged that Salvini and junior coalition ally the Brothers of Italy disagreed, but said: ""We will convince (them),"" according to Vitale.
Salvini has adopted a much more hostile line towards the European Union than Berlusconi, a point that was underlined on Wednesday when he said the euro currency was not irreversible, prompting investors to dump Italian government bonds.
Ahead of the vote, all parties promised to cut taxes and raise spending, apparently at odds with pledges to also cut a public debt that is second only to Greece's in the euro zone as a proportion of GDP. 
Among the most eye-catching proposals were the League's 15 percent flat tax rate and 5-Star's scheme to guarantee a minimum income of 780 euros ($964.47) a month.
It is not clear how either measure would be funded, and their potential impacts on public finances are comparable, Bank of Italy Director General Salvatore Rossi said on Wednesday.
""They are two very different, very expensive measures,"" Rossi told La7 TV. 
Salvini has promised not to abandon his partners, after Forza Italia's relegation to second place in the coalition prompted speculation the League could split off and join 5-Star. 
But a further potential obstacle to such a deal could come from within 5-Star, which has been trying to transmit a moderate message and reassure Europe and financial markets that it is fit to govern.
In an apparent reference to the League's radical allies in the European Parliament, including France's National Front and the Dutch Freedom Party, Di Maio said on Tuesday that 5-Star ""wants nothing to do with extremist parties in Europe"".
The new parliament sits for the first time on March 23. One of its first duties will be to elect presidents for the two chambers, a process which will give a glimpse of party dynamics. 
On Wednesday, Di Maio said he was confident Italy's government impasse would last less than the six months that passed before German politicians struck a deal this month.
""It won't all be roses, but this legislature can turn a page for the country, with a good budget law, strong budget planning, and dialogue between the groups,"" he said.

Speaking after a meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May in London, Scotland's First Minister struck a more positive tone than she had in recent weeks.
""The issues that remain between us are not insignificant but not insurmountable,"" Sturgeon said. ""With understanding a deal can be reached.""
The talks were aimed at unblocking a stalemate over post-Brexit powers as written into the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, which is now going through the British parliament. The sides have yet to agree on how powers should be split up after Brexit. 
Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones told reporters that a deal was ""close"" after the meeting.
Scotland and Wales have significant powers over health, education and agriculture, among other areas. Brexit will require a remapping of those powers, many of which are rooted in Britain's EU membership.
Scotland and Wales do not have a veto over the withdrawal bill, but the spat threatens legal complications in the way Brexit affects the UK's own jurisdiction. It has sown political discontent in and beyond nationalist circles in Scotland. 
That threatens to further undermine May's authority just as Brexit gets more complex. 
May's government says some powers should be kept in the national parliament temporarily to avoid divergence between Britain's nations and its internal market while it is determining what the long-term set-up will be.
The Scottish and Welsh say that the government's proposal does not respect the UK's two-decade-old devolution agreement and want a guaranteed say in how power is shared, rather than to be told what to do.

The withdrawal bill is being debated in parliament so EU legislation can be ""copied and pasted"" into UK law and give continuity after Brexit day in March 2019.

1159,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 08:39PM ET</span>",Secret trial shows risks of nerve agent theft in post-Soviet chaos: experts,"By Christian Lowe, Maria Tsvetkova and Anthony Deutsch
MOSCOW/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The British government says Russia is to blame for poisoning former spy Sergei Skripal with a nerve agent, and most chemical weapons specialists agree.
But they say an alternative explanation cannot be ruled out: that the nerve agent got into the hands of people not acting for the Russian state.
The Soviet Union's chemical weapons program was in such disarray in the aftermath of the Cold War that some toxic substances and know-how could have got into the hands of criminals, say people who dealt with the program at the time.
""Could somebody have smuggled something out?"" said Amy Smithson, a biological and chemical weapons expert.
""I certainly wouldn't rule that possibility out, especially a small amount and particularly in view of how lax the security was at Russian chemical facilities in the early 1990s.""
While nerve agents degrade over time, if the pre-cursor ingredients for the nerve agent were smuggled out back then, stored in proper conditions and mixed recently, they could still be deadly in a small-scale attack, two experts on chemical weapons told Reuters.
Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain in hospital in critical condition after being found unconscious on a bench in the city of Salisbury on March 4. A police officer was also harmed and remains in a serious condition.
British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday that ""there is no alternative conclusion, other than that the Russian state was culpable for the attempted murder of Mr. Skripal and his daughter, and for threatening the lives of other British citizens.""
Russia has denied any involvement in the nerve agent attack.
POISONED TELEPHONE
Accounts of security deficiencies at weapons facilities indicate that, at least for a period in the 1990s, Moscow was not in firm control of its chemical weapons stockpiles or the people guarding them.
When Russian banking magnate Ivan Kivelidi and his secretary died in 1995 from organ failure after a military-grade poison was found on the telephone receiver of his Moscow office, an employee of a state chemical research institute confessed to having secretly supplied the toxin.
In a closed-door trial, Kivelidi's business partner was convicted of poisoning Kivelidi over a dispute. At the trial, prosecutors said the business partner had obtained the poison, via several intermediaries, from Leonard Rink, an employee of a state chemical research institute known as GosNIIOKhT.
The same institute, according to Vil Mirzayanov, a Soviet chemical weapons scientist who later turned whistleblower, was part of the state chemical weapons program and helped develop the ""Novichok"" family of nerve agents that Britain has said was responsible for poisoning Skripal.
In a statement to investigators after his arrest, viewed by Reuters, Rink said he was in possession of poisons created as part of the chemical weapons program which he stored in his garage. On more than one occasion, he said, he sold the substances to supplement his income and pay down a debt.
The poison in the Kivelidi case was sold in a deal brokered by an ex-policeman contact of Rink's. Rink handed over the poison, in an ampoule hidden inside a pen presentation box, in a meeting at Moscow's Belorussky station, according to his statement.
Rink received a one-year suspended prison sentence for ""misuse of powers,"" according to Boris Kuznetsov, who was a lawyer for Kivelidi's business partner during the trial.
Kuznetsov said he believed his client was innocent, and that Kivelidi was poisoned by rogue intelligence officers acting without the knowledge of the Russian president at the time, Boris Yeltsin.
He added that he would share files from the case with the British authorities, because he believed they could be relevant to the Skripal investigation.
Reuters was not able to contact Rink.
STATE OF DISARRAY
The Soviet chemical weapons program was a sprawling operation spread across far-flung provincial cities that incorporated the world's largest chemical arsenal, publicly declared at 40,000 tonnes.
When the Soviet Union ceased to exist, funding dried up, scientists' salaries were in several months of arrears, staff morale slumped and facilities were left to fend for themselves with little government control or oversight.
According to a 1995 report published by the Henry L. Stimson Center, a Washington security think-tank, and based on accounts from industry insiders, physical security at the facilities was deficient.
It said railroad entrances to the facilities were padlocked but unguarded, and at some sites chemical weapons were stored in buildings with wooden doors and tiled roofs that an intruder could get into with little difficulty.
Chemical weapons were stored in silos without tamper-proof seals, making it difficult to detect if small quantities were being siphoned off.
A second report by the Stimson Center four years later highlighted the risk of Soviet chemical weapons scientists - who earned a pittance when they were paid at all - being recruited by criminals, terrorists, or rogue states.
""All the ingredients for successful black marketeering are present through the chemical and biological complexes - under- or unemployed, scientists and managers, valuable commodities at far-flung locations, and poor security,"" the report said.
SATELLITE STATES
In some cases in the early 1990s, highly toxic chemical agents wound up outside Russian territory, in ex-Soviet facilities in newly-independent states such as Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.
According to Mirzayanov, the former Soviet chemical weapons scientist, the ""Novichok"" family of nerve agents developed by the GosNIIOKhT institute was tested in Nukus, Uzbekistan.
In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, Mirzayanov, now resident in Princeton, New Jersey, said though he believed the Kremlin was behind the Skripal attack.
The ex-Soviet republics outside Russia that suddenly found themselves hosting ex-Soviet chemical weapons facilities were even less equipped than Moscow to secure them.
U.S. troops who arrived in Uzbekistan after 2001 to establish an air base in the city of Khanabad came across stockpiles of old munitions that had not been accounted for, which turned out to contain chlorine and other chemical compounds, said someone who was present at the time and who spoke on condition of anonymity.
People in the chemical weapons field said security since the 1990s had improved drastically, helped by Western aid, the transfer of weapons stockpiles from neighbouring states to Russia and a stronger Russian state.
Russia's trade and industry ministry, which oversaw the disposal of chemical weapons stockpiles, said in a statement sent to Reuters that Russia had destroyed 100 percent of the stocks in strict compliance with international commitments, and faster than the United States.
The ministry did not address questions about chemical weapons smuggling in the aftermath of the Soviet collapse.
Ukraine's state security service, which tracks weapons proliferation, said it had no immediate comment.
The Uzbek foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The state-owned Kazakh nuclear company which operates the Pavlodar Chemical Plant, a former chemical weapons facility, and the Energy Ministry, to which the nuclear company reports, did not reply to questions.

PARIS (Reuters) - The last time a French president squared off against rail unions over workers' benefits it ended badly. The strikes of 1995 paralyzed Paris and forced prime minister Alain Juppe to pull the reforms, a defeat from which he failed to recover.
Emmanuel Macron is undeterred. 
On Wednesday his government endorsed a bill to fast-track through parliament the biggest shake-up of France's debt-ridden railways since they were nationalized in 1930s.
The former investment banker's penchant for reform-by-decree after talks -- he adopted the same approach over labor reforms last summer -- has angered labor unions, who will decide on Thursday if they will resort to strikes.
""It's like putting a pistol to our heads and saying: 'Let's talk',"" Philippe Martinez, leader of the CGT union, said. 
Elected on a promise to transform France and backed by a commanding majority in parliament, Macron has tackled at a relentless pace issues long considered sacred cows: protective labor laws, the bloated public sector, schools and now the state-run SNCF railways.
French unions are weaker and more divided than in 1995 and public support for strikes is less ardent than it once was.
And while the unions have threatened action over his plans to transform the SNCF into a profit-maker and prepare it for foreign competition in 2020, Macron has the public on his side. 
One recent poll showed two in every three French people backed contracts for rail workers that would no longer guarantee a job for life and early retirement.
Laurent Berger, head of the moderate CFDT, France's largest union, told Europe 1 radio: ""Either we chose confrontation between a camp in favor of the status quo versus the camp of 'we start from scratch' or we chose the path of negotiation and we find a way forward.""
CHANGING TIMES
Rail workers have threatened to strike on March 22, the same day that several public sector unions plan a walkout.
The weeks ahead will be a test of their support, after they failed to mobilize nationwide protests to alter the government's course on making it easier to hire and fire workers.
There appears a recognition among some unionists that they may struggle to garner momentum.
""Beyond the SNCF, there doesn't seem to be a mass desire to take to the streets,"" Jean-Claude Mailly, leader of the Force Ouvriere union, told France Inter radio.
In 2010, then-president Nicolas Sarkozy took on the unions over pension reform. At the time there were predictions of a 1995-redux. Millions took to the streets but Sarkozy stood firm and the reform happened.
As with Sarkozy at that time, Macron's intent to take on unions has drawn comparisons with Margaret Thatcher, the British prime minister who challenged mining unions in the 1980s. She won and unions in Britain never recovered their might.
""Both Macron and Thatcher were inspired by the same desire for reform and belief that it was the key to economic recovery,"" Remi Bourguignon, a labor relations specialist at the Sorbonne Business School in Paris, told Reuters.

""It is not implausible either that they share the view of intermediary bodies (unions) more as hurdles than as stepping stones - that they saw their ability to bypass them as a measure of political courage.""

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - A suicide bomb blast ripped through a police checkpoint in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore on Wednesday, killing seven people and wounding 18, officials said.
Jam Sajjad Hussain, spokesman of a state-run rescue service, told Reuters that his officials had taken seven dead bodies to hospitals. 
""Our rescuers are at work,"" he said. ""They have shifted so far seven bodies.""
Deputy Inspector General of police Haider Ashraf said the bomb exploded when the police were changing guards at the checkpoint just outside an annual religious congregation, where nearly 80,000 people were in attendance. 
""I can at the moment say that police was the target,"" he said. ""It was a suicide bomber riding a motorcycle who attacked the police,"" Ashraf said. He said four of the dead were police.
No claim of responsibility was immediately made.
Lahore is considered a cultural hub of the nuclear-armed nation of over 208 million people where Islamist militants have been fighting for over a decade against the state in a bid to install their own harsh brand of Islamic governance.
The city has largely been spared the militant violence seen in the country's northwest which sits at the edge of a lawless mountain range along the Afghan border. That area has long been home to local and foreign Islamist militants from the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, and where Islamic State has lately made footholds.
The Pakistani Taliban leadership have fled to neighbouring Afghanistan from where Islamabad alleges they plan and execute terrorist attacks inside Pakistan. 
Washington on Thursday offered a $5 million bounty for the Pakistani Taliban militant leader, Mulllah Fazlullah, a day after a suspected U.S. drone strike on a training camp in a remote part of Afghanistan killed his son and more than 20 other militants preparing to launch suicide attacks in Pakistan. 
The U.S. cooperation comes amid worsening U.S.-Pakistan relations, and coincided with a visit to Washington by Pakistan's foreign secretary for talks expected to focus on boosting counter-terrorism cooperation and the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan.

In his first speech as foreign minister shortly after taking up the post in Germany's new coalition government, Maas also criticized Russia's behavior in Ukraine but said he still hoped to improve relations with Moscow through dialogue.
""We take the assessment of the British government (on the chemical attack) seriously and it is disappointing that Russia seems not to be willing to contribute to clearing up (this case),"" Maas told foreign ministry staff and reporters.
""Moscow should be ready to be transparent... And it is clear this cannot go without consequences,"" he said, adding that Germany would stay in close contact with its NATO ally Britain on the matter.
""The perpetrators must be held accountable... We can fully understand why Britain had to react to this (attack).""
Russia denies any involvement in the attack on Russian ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. They were found unconscious on March 4 on a bench in the English city of Salisbury and remain in a critical condition in hospital.
Prime Minister Theresa May announced earlier on Wednesday that Britain would kick out 23 Russian diplomats, the biggest expulsion since the Cold War, over the attack, which she blamed squarely on President Vladimir Putin.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other Western leaders have already condemned the attack and backed Britain's demands that Russia cooperate with the investigation.
Maas said German foreign policy had had to adapt to a situation in which Russia increasingly defined itself as an antagonist to Western countries.
""We continue to disapprove of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and the ongoing aggression against Ukraine,"" he said, referring to a four-year conflict in eastern Ukraine between Kiev's forces and pro-Russian separatists.
Maas, who was speaking after lawmakers re-elected Merkel as chancellor for a fourth, and likely final, term, said Germany must live up to its international responsibilities, and he vowed not to avoid confronting difficult issues.
Germany, Europe's biggest economy, is facing calls to take a more active approach on issues ranging from euro zone reforms to the threat of U.S. trade sanctions and a more assertive Russia.

Maas was due to hold talks in Paris later on Wednesday with his French counterpart.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May's response to Russia after a nerve agent attack on British soil is unlikely to trouble Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin unduly, despite the expression of outrage that greeted it in Moscow.
After the first known use of a military-grade nerve toxin on British soil since World War Two, May expelled 23 Russian spies using diplomatic cover and promised to freeze Russian State assets if they were used to threaten British interests.
May also said Britain would work on new powers to defend against hostile state activity, beef up counter espionage powers and cut back official participation in the soccer World Cup. Other measures may be considered, she said.
But her announcement, just days before an election in which Putin, a former KGB officer, is expected to coast to a fourth term, gave no examples of Russian officials or companies that would be targeted or barred from London's financial center.
London remains open to Russian investment, albeit with a political chill. Other than the expulsions, May went no further than current EU sanctions which include travel restrictions and asset freezes against 150 people and 38 companies.
""The Kremlin will understand this as a very mild response,"" said Mathieu Boulègue, a Russia expert at Chatham House think-tank in London. ""Putin is unlikely to be worried by this.""
A senior British government official said further options remained on the table: ""Economic, diplomatic, legislative, and our security capabilities can all be brought to bear if needed.""
But after days of full-volume rhetoric from London about the suspected Russian attack and a midnight deadline that Moscow scorned, May has shown just how little appetite Britain has for a fight on the eve of Brexit.
While the United States and European Union joined criticism of Moscow - albeit with a delayed response from U.S. President Donald Trump - there was little evidence of appetite in Paris, Berlin or Washington for anything beyond a scolding.
Russia denied any involvement in the attack and simply declined to say anything about how a Soviet-era nerve toxin ended up striking down a former double agent on the normally genteel streets of the English city of Salisbury.
The foreign ministry described May's measures as a flagrant provocation and promised a speedy response.
If Russia - or Russians - were behind the nerve attack, some of their aims may have been achieved: Britain has shown just how little power it is willing to exercise while every Kremlin opponent will be more nervous about retribution.
For many Russian experts, the attack on Sergei Skripal, a former GRU military intelligence officer who betrayed dozens of Russian agents to MI6, was a test for Britain after years of turning a blind eye to the reality of modern Russia.
Part of that policy is due to money. 
One of the biggest exports since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union was money and London, as one of the top two financial capitals in the world, is a major beneficiary.
London, or Londongrad as it is sometimes dubbed, is the Western capital of choice for the oligarchs and Russian officials who flaunt their wealth across Europe's most luxurious destinations.
France, with its own business ties to Russia, has been more muted on the issue of Russian involvement in the attack on Skripal than Germany or the United States.
""Britain has tied itself up in knots,"" said a French official who spoke on condition of anonymity. 

""It’s had a very open policy on Russian private investment and émigrés for years and now it wants Europe to offer support in taking steps against Moscow. This is for them (Britain) to respond to. It’s shocking that it happened, but ultimately it’s up to Britain.""

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's Vice President Martin Vizcarra would not resign to pave the way to early elections if President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski were removed from office by an impeachment vote, two sources told Reuters this week.
Opposition lawmakers are seeking to impeach center-right Kuczynski over accusations he lied about his ties to Odebrecht [ODBES.UL], a Brazilian construction conglomerate at the heart of a far-reaching graft probe.
After a first impeachment vote failed in December by just eight votes, a second was presented by opposition lawmakers last week. Kuczynski, a 79-year-old former Wall Street banker who denies wrongdoing, warned it would create chaos and said there was no legitimate reason to oust him.
If Kuczynski were removed from office, Peru's constitution dictates that Vizcarra replace him as a president. Early elections would be held if both Vizcarra and Kuczynski's second vice president resign.
In the past week, ruling party lawmakers have called for Vizcarra to pledge to resign out of loyalty.
But Vizcarra believes it would be his duty to govern Peru until the next scheduled elections in 2021 instead of deepening the political turmoil by resigning, said a source close to Vizcarra, who asked not to be named.
A government source also said that Vizcarra, a 54-year-old former governor of a mining region, was opposed to stepping down.
Vizcarra declined to comment. ""I can't put myself in scenarios that haven't happened yet,"" Vizcarra told Reuters at a mining conference in Toronto last week.
Investors in Peru, the world's No. 2 copper producer and one of Latin America's most stable economies, fear fresh elections might sweep anti-establishment candidates to power at a time when the corruption scandal and constant political feuding has left many Peruvians disgusted with elected officials.
On the eve of the impeachment vote in December, Kuczynski signaled that if he lost, both his vice presidents would resign to protest what he called a legislative coup.
But Vizcarra disagreed with that stance and refused to sign a resignation letter prepared for him before the vote, the sources said.
Relations between Vizcarra and Kuczynski cooled after that, and Vizcarra no longer weighs in on government decisions, the sources said.
Kuczynski named Vizcarra transportation minister upon taking office in July 2016, but Vizcarra resigned after lawmakers threatened to censure him over a controversial airport contract.
Since September, Vizcarra has been Peru's ambassador to Canada as well as vice president.

A national election on March 4 gave no one group enough seats to form a majority, starting a power struggle between the right-wing coalition, which won the most seats, and the anti-system 5-Star Movement, which emerged as the biggest party.
Berlusconi told a meeting of newly elected parliamentarians he wanted a minority government ""with the support of the PD on individual measures"", Forza Italia Senator Luigi Vitale told reporters.

ROME (Reuters) - A 22-year-old Eritrean man died of tuberculosis exacerbated by severe malnutrition after being rescued at sea and brought to Italy, showing how dire conditions are in Libya for migrants, aid workers said on Wednesday.
Huge numbers of migrants have converged on Libya in recent years in the hope of crossing the Mediterranean to Europe, and many of those who avoid drowning are arriving in Italy in terrible physical shape.
On Monday, a ship run by Proactiva Open Arms, a Spanish charity, brought 93 people including the Eritrean to Italy after rescuing them on Sunday from an overcrowded rubber boat off Libya. The man, Segen, whose full name was not given, disembarked in Pozzallo, a port on the southern coast of Sicily. 
Weighing only 35 kg (77 lbs), the 1.70 m (5 ft 7 inch) tall Segen needed help to walk and was immediately taken to hospital, where he died less than 12 hours later, said Roberto Ammatuna, the mayor of Pozzallo and head of the local hospital's emergency room. 
""He looked like he had been in a concentration camp,"" Ammatuna told Reuters. ""All the migrants who arrived on Monday were skin and bones, and their muscles were atrophied. Obviously the conditions in Libya are inhuman."" 
Three other men were taken to hospital because of weakness and malnutrition. In January, a three-month-old baby rescued by Proactiva died partly because of severe malnutrition, the group's medical coordinator, Guillermo Canardo, said. 
People traffickers in Libya have sent hundreds of thousands of migrants to sea over the past four years, but departures have fallen dramatically since July as Italy and the European Union helped bolster the Tripoli-based coast guard, and as some local armed groups stopped smuggling.
TRAPPED
Arrivals in Italy from Libya have dropped more than 72 percent this year from last, official data show. That means many may have been trapped in Libya for longer periods than previously.
""Migrants tell me they have been in Libya longer than I was hearing a year ago,"" Marco Rotunno of the United Nations refugee agency said. 
Segen told the doctor on board the Proactiva ship that he had been in Libya for about 18 months. 
Migrants who traveled with Segen said they had been held by smugglers in a large warehouse for months, where they were tortured and beaten, according to Medu, a charity providing psychological support to those who arrive in Pozzallo. They told Medu they paid about $1,500 to make the sea crossing.
The U.N. estimates that hundreds of thousands of migrants remain in Libya. Those who make it to Italy tell of being extorted, beaten, tortured, raped, starved and forced to work for no pay.
Segen's death confirms data collected by Medu over the past four years, Alberto Barbieri, director of Medu, told Reuters.
About 70 percent of migrants interviewed by Medu said they were deprived of food and water while in Libya. ""Many others die in Libya and we know nothing about it,"" Barbieri said.

Most of those arrested were males and some were as young as 13, Sheila B. Keetharuth, the U.N.'s Special Rapporteur for human rights in Eritrea told a U.N. Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva. 
The leaders of the country in the Horn of Africa should be tried for crimes against humanity including torture, rape, murder and enslaving hundreds of thousands of people, a U.N. investigation set up by the Council said in 2016.
President Isaias Afwerki has led Eritrea since independence from Ethiopia in 1991 and his government operates a policy of compulsory military service that thousands each month flee the country to escape, according the United Nations.
There was no immediate comment from the government on Wednesday. In 2016, the government rejected the allegations and said they were an attempt to harass the country.
This month's arrests followed the death in custody of Haji Musa Mohamednur, 93, who was a director of a private Islamic school in the capital Asmara and a respected elder, according to a U.N. statement.
He and other members of the school's administration were arrested last October for defying government orders including enforcing a ban on the veil and stopping religious teachings.
""Reports reaching me ... point to the arrest of hundreds of people, mainly males, some of them children as young as 13 years, after the burial of Haji Musa,"" the statement quoted Keetharuth as saying.
The statement gave no details of the circumstances of Musa's death this month. In October, there was a similar wave of detentions when law enforcement officers violently broke up a crowd and arrested over 100 people including students, she said.
""The indiscriminate mass arrests in October 2017 and during the past week were carried out to quell any kind of protest or resistance,"" she said.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The pre-trial hearing examining charges against Vatican treasurer Cardinal George Pell of historical sexual offences re-opened to the public and media on Wednesday following a week of closed evidence from complainants.
Pell, 76, a top adviser to Pope Francis, sat quietly next to his lawyers during the open session at Melbourne Magistrates' Court.
The hearing, scheduled to last four weeks, started on March 5 to determine if prosecutors have enough evidence for a case to be committed to a full trial.
In the open session, Pell's lawyers called as a witness the father of an alleged victim. The father, who can't be named under Australian law in case it identifies the alleged victim, told the court he had no reason to suspect his son had been sexually assaulted. The allegation only arose after his son died of what he said was an accidental heroin overdose in 2014.
""I never saw, he never hinted that there was something going on,"" the father, who described himself as a practicing Catholic, said via a video link to the court.
He said his son had been in and out of drug rehabilitation centers seven or eight times. The father said his son had said he got hooked on heroin because he enjoyed the drug and had never hinted that he had turned to drugs as a result of sexual abuse.
""It was nobody's fault he was doing it,"" the father said.
Pell's lawyer, Robert Richter, also called Bernard Barrett, a researcher for Broken Rites, an organization that documents cases of alleged abuse by the Catholic Church and advises victims, and accused the group of making up allegations against the church and its clergy.
""You rile against the Catholic Church covering up sex abuse,"" Richter said, suggesting it would have been a feather in Barrett's cap ""to pin something on Cardinal Pell.""
Barrett said it was up to alleged victims to lodge complaints with police and denied he was trying implicate Pell.
""Not really. It's not my concern. It's up to the complainants,"" he said.
Pell's lawyers have said at previous administrative hearings that Pell will plead not guilty to all charges. Pell is not required to enter a formal plea unless a magistrate determines there is cause for a full trial.

Australian police last year summoned Pell to return to his home country and appear on charges of ""historical sexual offences"" from multiple complainants. Details of the charges have not been made public.
The court was closed to the public for most of the first 10 days to protect the privacy of people giving evidence.
Pell is on a leave of absence from his Vatican role as Francis' economy minister, which he started in 2014. The pontiff has said he will not comment on the case until it is over.

1171,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>",France wants proof before responding on Britain poisoning affair,"By John Irish and Marine Pennetier
PARIS (Reuters) - France on Wednesday said it wanted firm proof of Russian involvement in the nerve-toxin poisoning of a Russian double agent in Britain before it took any action in solidarity with the British government.
In contrast to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. President Donald Trump who assured British Prime Minister Theresa May they were taking her government's views on possible Russian involvement extremely seriously, President Emmanuel Macron and other French officials have declined to mention Russia.
After France initialed condemned the nerve agent attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter and expressed solidarity with Britain on Tuesday, French government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux on Wednesday said it was too early for Paris to decide whether action should be taken.
""We don't do fantasy politics. Once the elements are proven, then the time will come for decisions to be made,"" Griveaux told a news conference shortly after May said she was expelling Russian diplomats and suspending bilateral talks.
While he called the attack a ""very serious act"" on a strategic ally, Griveaux said France was waiting for ""definitive conclusions"" and evidence that the ""facts were completely true"" before taking a position.
Britain's ambassador to France, Ed Llewellyn, tweeted on Tuesday that the first neuro toxin attack on European soil since 1945 required a ""strong and coordinated response from our allies.""
When asked whether Paris would be ready to take counter-measures on Russia given London's claims, foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes Von der Muhll said Paris was in close contact with Britain on the issue.
Without answering directly, she added that Paris fully-supported a NATO statement calling on Russia to give Britain ""complete disclosure"" of the Soviet-era nerve agent used in the attack. 
France's muted reaction is in contrast with its closest allies, but is in line with Macron's efforts since coming into office to build a new relationship with Russia's Vladimir Putin. 
Rather than directly confronting Putin through threats and megaphone diplomacy, he has emphasized private dialogue, while pushing for a restoration of business and cultural ties despite existing European Union sanctions on Moscow.
Diplomats say Macron believes ostracizing Moscow will not yield results given its importance on the world stage and role in world crises. Despite obvious differences, he believes it is vital to keep a working relationship going with Russia.
Standing alongside Putin last May at the Chateau de Versailles, Macron heralded the start to a new page in relations after tensions under the previous administration. He said at the time that he wouldn't let differences over Syria, Ukraine and human rights strain their relationship.
Nearly a year on, there is little evidence to suggest he has gained anything tangible from the alternative approach in terms of foreign policy successes. However, he is due to be the guest of honor at an investor forum in Saint Petersburg at the end of May where a large French business delegation will also be present.
""France has a policy on Russia that it’s going to stick to. There’s no reason for this to knock that off-target,"" a French official said. ""You’ve got to remember there are pretty close ties between France and Russia, whether around literature, culture and business, and they are important.""

Ofcom warned on Tuesday that RT could lose its right to broadcast in Britain if it failed a so-called ""fit and proper"" test. It had said it would take it into consideration if May blamed Russia for the poisoning attack.
Russia's Foreign Ministry has warned British media will be expelled if the UK shuts down RT.
May told parliament on Wednesday she believed Russia was indeed behind the attack that left ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in a critical condition in hospital in the southern English city of Salisbury. 
""We are now considering the Prime Minister's update,"" a spokesman for Ofcom said. May was asked about RT in parliament but said its status remained a matter for the regulator and not the government. 
Russia has denied involvement in the poisoning and RT, which says it covers stories overlooked by the mainstream media, has criticized Ofcom's position. 
""We continue today, as ever, to provide a valuable alternative voice within the UK media environment and we trust that Ofcom will recognize this is the case and that nothing has changed,"" a spokesman for RT said. 
Ofcom, which enforces the broadcasting code in Britain, is charged with checking that holders of licenses are ""fit and proper"". RT is available in 100 countries including in Britain where it broadcasts from London. 
Ofcom has previously stripped two companies of their licenses to operate in Britain, one for broadcasting hate speech and another for showing explicit adult content.

Four U.S. special forces members and at least four Nigerien soldiers were killed in the raid in the western Niger village of Tongo Tongo by dozens of militants armed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. Islamic State's West Africa affiliate claimed responsibility.
The ambush marked the first U.S. combat casualties in Niger. It sparked an international debate about America's covert role tracking Islamist insurgents in the arid and thinly-populated Sahel region just south of the Sahara.
It also prompted discussion within the United States about the military tactics being used in remote battlefields. After the incident, President Donald Trump clashed publicly with a congresswoman who accused him of speaking insensitively to the pregnant widow of one of the American soldiers who was killed.
Colonel Mark Cheadle, a spokesman for the U.S. military's Africa Command, said it was investigating the statement made by MSA-GATIA, a Tuareg militia group in northern Mali, but that it could not confirm its claim to have found the vehicle.
In the statement, which was accompanied by a photo of a beat-up blue Toyota Landcruiser and two military-style rifles, MSA-GATIA said it captured the material from unidentified ""armed bandits"" on the Mali side of the border with Niger in fighting on March 11 and 12. 
""The MSA-GATIA coalition proposes returning this material to American authorities by legal channels,"" the statement said.
The militia, composed mainly of ethnic Tuaregs, has frequently clashed with jihadist groups whose influence is on the rise in northern and central Mali. 
The jihadists have used Mali as a springboard for attacks into neighboring Niger and Burkina Faso, including coordinated raids on the military headquarters and French embassy in the Burkina Faso capital Ouagadougou earlier this month that killed eight people.
Those attacks have alarmed U.S. officials, who fear that the Sahel could become a new haven for Islamist militants and have deployed hundreds of American troops to train local forces and gather intelligence.

THE KERCH STRAIT/SEVASTOPOL, Crimea (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Crimea on Wednesday, touting his annexation of the peninsula to voters days before an election all but guaranteed to deliver him a second consecutive term in power.
Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine drew international condemnation and sanctions, but many Russians saw it as restoring Moscow's rule over a region they regard as being historically Russian.
Appearing in front of a crowd of cheering supporters in the Crimean city of Sevastopol, Putin said that, four years ago, the people of Crimea took the historic decision to become part of Russia.
""With your decision, you restored historical justice which was violated in Soviet times when Crimea was torn away from Russia,"" Putin said, referring to a 1954 decision to designate the peninsula part of the Ukrainian Soviet republic.
He said there was still work to be done to raise living standards in Crimea, but said: ""When we are together we are a huge force able to resolve even the most difficult task.""
Ukraine's government, and Western states, reject the Russian argument that the people of Crimea chose to join Russia, saying there was an armed occupation by Russian forces in violation of international law.
Earlier on Wednesday, Putin inspected work on a bridge that will link Russia to Crimea.
The 19-km (12-mile) road-and-rail bridge across the Kerch Strait, which some Russians have dubbed ""Putin's bridge"", is designed to integrate Crimea with Russia's transport network, and show off Moscow's largesse.
The bridge will be the longest dual-purpose span in Europe when completed. It is seen as vital by the Kremlin to integrate Crimea into Russia, both symbolically and as an economic lifeline for the region.
Putin, accompanied by officials in hard hats, was given a tour of the still-uncompleted central section of the bridge, and posted for photographs with workers.
""What you've done already is impressive,"" Putin told workers in high-visibility jackets.
The Russian president, who projects an image of a demanding taskmaster, was told that the part of the bridge that will carry road traffic would be completed in December. A parallel rail bridge is also being built.
Putin proposed a different timetable, saying: ""It would be good to do it in time for the vacation season.""
""We'll do our best,"" replied Arkady Rotenberg, the Kremlin-connected billionaire whose company Stroygazmontazh is building the bridge. 
Rotenberg, Putin's former judo sparring partner, told reporters later that the road part of the bridge would now open from May 9 - the day Russia celebrates the anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two. 
""The uniqueness of the bridge lies in the fact that everything here is Russian,"" said Rotenberg, who is on U.S. and European sanctions blacklists that have made it difficult for his firm to import Western materials and technology.
Opinion polls show Putin is far ahead of his rivals in the run-up to Sunday's presidential election, when he will be seeking a second consecutive term.
However, Kremlin officials are concerned voters may stay at home because they assume the result is a foregone conclusion, resulting in low turnout.

In September, 53.5 percent of voters backed the construction of the 27-kilometre (17-mile) railway line between the city of Divaca and the state-owned Adriatic seaport Luka Koper, a project worth 1 billion euros ($1.24 billion).
But Vili Kovacic, head of the civil society group Taxpayers Don't Give Up, complained to the court, saying the government had an advantage in the referendum because it used 95,000 euros of budget funds to support its campaign.
""The government's campaign was inadmissibly one-sided,"" the court said and ordered the State Election Commission to set a new referendum date. The Commission is expected to set the date in the coming days. 
The referendum was initiated by Kovacic's group, which argued that the line was too expensive and asked voters to reject the project. 
The center-left government has so far received 44.3 million euros of European Union funding for track preparation, and neighboring Hungary has said it was willing to invest about 200 million euros in the project, since it relies on the port of Koper for much of its seaborne freight.
The court's decision adds to the troubles of the government of Prime Minister Miro Cerar three months before a parliamentary election, which is expected on June 10. 
Also on Wednesday, teachers demanding higher wages held their second one-day strike this year, closing most schools and kindergartens. Other public-sector unions also threaten strikes unless the government agrees to hefty wage hikes.

The protesters, led by the left-wing Popular Unity party, chanted ""No home in the hands of bankers!"" and threw eggs and garbage at a line of police guarding the office's entrance.
At least one protester was visibly injured in the scuffles, with blood around his eye. 
The auctions, a condition of the bailouts Greece negotiated with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, have often been disrupted by leftist activists who say they are unfair and target the poor.
Notaries, who handle the auctions, boycotted them for months over safety concerns, but returned to work after the government said it would improve the process and increase security. Online auctions began in November. 
Greek banks are saddled with more than 100 billion euros in bad loans after years of financial crisis, mainly due to people's inability to repay mortages.

Popular Unity said four e-auctions had been scheduled to take place at the office in Athens targeted by the protesters on Wednesday, each involving accumulated debts of up to 100,000 euros.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa rebuked an Australian government minister on Wednesday for suggesting white South African farmers needed help from a ""civilized country"" and should get special visas due to the ""horrific circumstances"" they faced at home.
Commenting on a documentary about violent rural crime in South Africa, Australian immigration minister Peter Dutton said the farmers deserved ""special attention"", according to Australian domestic media reports.
""I do think, on the information that I've seen, people do need help and they need help from a civilized country like ours,"" Dutton said. 
As another threat to farmers, he also pointed to plans by new President Cyril Ramaphosa to allow expropriation of land as a solution to the massive land ownership inequalities that remain more than two decades after the end of apartheid.
Pretoria dismissed his comments out of hand.
""That threat does not exist,"" the foreign ministry said. ""There is no reason for any government in the world to suspect that a section of South Africans is under danger from their own democratically elected government.""
""We regret that the Australian government chose not to use the available diplomatic channels available for them to raise concerns or to seek clarification,"" it added.
Although violent crime is a serious issue across South African society, killings on farms, the vast majority of which are white-owned, has become a particularly racially charged issue.
FARM MURDERS
Afriforum, a rights group that mainly represents the views of the white Afrikaner minority, describes being a white farmer as one of the most dangerous jobs in the country, saying a white farmer is twice as likely to be murdered as a policemen, and four times as likely as a private citizen.
Reuters was not able to verify the figures independently.
Afriforum says that in many cases, farm murders also involve torture.
The government denies that whites are deliberately targeted and says farm murders are part of South Africa's wider violent crime problem.
Afriforum chief executive Kallie Kriel applauded Dutton for highlighting the issue but said his organization was not advocating mass emigration.
""Our future is in Africa, not elsewhere,"" he said. ""But it's good that there's international recognition that we have a problem here.""
Speaking to parliament on Tuesday, Ramaphosa said South Africa was not heading down the road toward the type of violent and chaotic seizure of white-owned farms that triggered economic collapse in Zimbabwe nearly 20 years ago.
""We cannot have a situation where we allow land grabs, because that is anarchy,"" Ramaphosa said. ""We cannot have a situation of anarchy when we have proper constitutional means through which we can work to give land to our people.""
He has also said redistribution will not jeopardize South Africa's food supply.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Syria could see ""tremendous battles"" for two remaining rebel enclaves even once a government onslaught on the last insurgent pocket near Damascus is over, a senior U.N. adviser said in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday. 
International attention has focused on the battle for besieged eastern Ghouta outside the capital and for Afrin in the far north where Turkey sent in forces to combat Kurdish militia it sees as a threat to its security. 
But they are not the last flashpoints as Syria's war enters its eighth year, three years after the tide began turning in the government's favor, said Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council and a senior U.N. adviser on Syria.
""Our fear is that after eastern Ghouta we may see tremendous battles now in and around Idlib (in the far northwest)and, in the south, Deraa,"" he said.
Those would be just the latest in a string of increasingly bitter and cruel ""end battles"" following fighting for Homs, Aleppo, Raqqa and Deir al-Zor, Egeland said. 
He said that in each battle, civilians were caught between warring sides who justified their ruthlessness by claiming to be fighting terrorism or dictatorship. 
""It’s really not too late to have talks around Idlib, to have talks around Deraa, and to have talks around Afrin,"" he said. ""Idlib would be a tremendous concern because Idlib is in many ways a gigantic refugee camp.""
To stem one of the worst effects of the fighting - air strikes on medical facilities - Egeland said a new notification system for the coordinates of more than a dozen hospitals had gone into effect in the last few days. 
""We have delivered coordinates on hospitals both in eastern Ghouta and in Idlib to the United States and to Russia, and Russia will not only guarantee that they will not attack, we’re asking them also to make sure that Syrian armed forces, the air force, is not targeting the hospitals,"" Egeland said.
Russia is Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's main military ally in the conflict.

""I was in touch with the Russians and the Americans yesterday on this,"" Egeland said. ""The armed groups have given it to the U.N., and the U.N. has transmitted this to Russia and the U.S., and they will then transmit it to their allies.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - Crimes against humanity have been committed in Mexico ""in the name of security"", actor Gael Garcia Bernal told the United Nations Human Rights Council on Wednesday.
Activists and U.N. investigators have accused Mexican security forces of murder, torture and disappearances since the military was sent to fight its powerful drug cartels in 2007. 
More than 100,000 have been killed in drug-related violence in the decade since, including 25,000 murders last year. Tens of thousands have gone missing or disappeared, many abducted by security forces, activists say.
""The numbers are growing; the pain of families is also growing,"" Garcia Bernal said in a speech to the Geneva forum. Mexico is one of its 47 member states. 
""As a result of the war against narco-trafficking, the most serious violations of human rights have been committed, including crimes against humanity in the name of security,"" he said.
The international community cannot allow the situation to continue in the country where ""freedom of expression is being limited and journalists and human rights defenders continue to be killed,"" he added.
Mexico's delegation had been on the list of speakers for Wednesday's session but withdrew, U.N. officials said.
Mexico’s government has said it is committed to investigating and punishing cases of human rights abuses. It denies high-level involvement in some of the more egregious cases, such as 43 students who went missing in 2014. But investigations have dragged on for years without conclusion.
""We need the cooperation of countries in this Council to have a mechanism against impunity that will guarantee that the heinous crimes taking place now will not happen again in the future,"" said Garcia Bernal, speaking on behalf of the Mexican Commission for the Defence and Promotion of Human Rights.
On Tuesday, he called for the United Nations and governments around the world to put pressure on Mexico to end impunity for corruption and large-scale killings.
""Elections are coming, stakes are pretty high. This is the moment, the moment to overturn things,"" the 39-year-old told reporters, referring to presidential elections in July.
Anabel Hernandez, a Mexican investigative journalist, called for combating ""corruption and the culture of impunity that are destroying the country"".
Authorities have resolved just one percent of murders and remain ""totally incapable"" of bringing justice, Hernandez told an audience at the International Film Festival and Human Rights Forum (FIFDH) on Tuesday night. Some 171 journalists were murdered from 2001 to 2017, she added.

""We cannot go on like this, otherwise every family in Mexico will have at least one person murdered or disappeared,"" said Ixchel Cisneros, another Mexican journalist on the panel.

1184,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",U.S. looks to protect Afghan capital against Taliban bombings,"By Phil Stewart
BAGRAM AIRFIELD, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Once seen as relatively secure, the sprawling Afghan capital of Kabul is becoming the main focus of an intensified U.S.-backed battle against the Taliban this year after a series of high-profile attacks exposed major gaps in security.
""Kabul is our main effort. To harden Kabul, to protect the people of Kabul and the international community that are here,"" U.S. General John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, told a group of reporters on Wednesday.
The remarks underscored the high degree of concern about the Taliban's intent to stage high-profile attacks in Kabul, which are aimed at undermining the Afghan government and international resolve after 16 years of war.
They are also a reminder that while U.S. and Afghan officials speak with growing confidence about the prospects of peace talks with elements of the Taliban, the military is also making long-term preparations for an extended conflict, including in the capital.
Nicholson said Kabul's exponential growth from about 500,000 people in 2001 to 5 million today had created a haphazard sprawl that was hard to secure. U.S. intelligence agencies were helping Afghanistan map the city so police and soldiers can better design barriers and checkpoints.
""I'll just be very candid. We have a lot of work to do,"" Nicholson said.
""This growth at that rate has meant that there's a lot of sprawl. It's easy to get in and out of the city."" 
In the past year, insurgents have staged massive bombings in the Afghan capital, including one in January that killed more than 100 people and another in May 2017 near the German embassy.
No group claimed the May 2017 attack but Afghan and U.S. officials blamed the Haqqani network, a violent militant group affiliated to the Taliban. The Taliban claimed the second attack but many officials say it bore the hallmarks of the Haqqanis, who the United States says enjoy safe haven in neighboring Pakistan.
U.S. President Donald Trump has piled pressure on Pakistan to crack down on the safehavens, announcing in January a suspension in U.S. financial assistance to Islamabad.
""BACKCHANNEL COMMUNICATION"" 
Nicholson said the Afghan Army were taking over at least some of the once ""porous"" police checkpoints inside the city, and was training specialized soldiers to stand guard. 
The goal was to establish an inner-ring of security along with an outer-ring of security, and clear everything in between.
A group of newly arriving U.S. Army advisers would partner with some of the Afghan troops securing Kabul. Commandos would carry out intelligence-driven raids throughout the city, something Nicholson said was already ongoing.
The goal would be to eliminate Taliban strongholds as well as Taliban facilitators, which included criminal enterprises that, for a price, gave the insurgents shelter or weapons.
""The Taliban are in the city,"" Nicholson said. ""So this is a process of deliberately clearing sections of the city. That's begun.""
Nicholson's comments came during a trip to Afghanistan by U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whose delegation navigated some of Kabul's checkpoints and blast walls while moving between U.S. military and Afghan government compounds on Tuesday, helicopters buzzing overhead.
Trump approved a more aggressive strategy last year that included more U.S. combat advisers and air strikes, and fighting is expected to pick up in the coming weeks.
Mattis said on Tuesday that the United States had seen signs of interest from elements of the Taliban insurgency about talks with Kabul to end the conflict.
Nicholson echoed that, noting there was more outreach than publicly known - including through ""backchannel"" intermediaries.
""What you don't see in the news of course is all the backchannel communication that's going on at multiple levels, through the Gulf, from the Taliban leadership through various means, and so forth,"" he said.
""So there's definitely an increase in the dialogue and the communication between the sides about reconciliation. And more than I've seen in any of the previous times I've been around this.""
Still, it was unclear whether the latest prospects would prove any more fruitful than previous, frustrated attempts to move toward a negotiated end to America's longest war.

Taliban fighters still control large parts of the country and any new battlefield gains by U.S. and U.S.-backed Afghan forces cannot promise to overcome Afghanistan's yawning political divisions and entrenched corruption.

PONTOISE, France (Reuters) - He may have won election on a promise to be ""neither of the left, nor the right"", but France's mould-breaking young president is finding out that enacting broad welfare and labor reforms without a traditional power base has its price.
In a by-election last month, the voters of the tidy market town of Pontoise, west of Paris, made clear their disenchantment with Emmanuel Macron by stripping his party of a parliamentary seat won only eight months earlier.
Chief among their complaints is cuts to pensions - one of the ways the 40-year-old former investment banker has tried to pay for a reduction in taxes on salaries.
""For pensioners such as myself, it’s a real catastrophe. It’s been presented as 'only fair', but it’s an injustice, pure and simple,"" said Yvan Mary, a 71-year-old pensioner standing outside the bakery on the main square.
""It's not what people expected, including those who voted for him. There's a sense of betrayal.""
Despite economic growth at its highest in six years, falling unemployment, and international newspapers and magazine covers celebrating ""Macronmania"", Macron's approval rating is now at its lowest since his election, at around 43 percent.
And nowhere is the frustration more acute than among France's over-65s -- the age group where Macron found the strongest support in the presidential vote last year.
In one survey, Macron suffered a nine-point fall in February alone, after most pensioners noticed a decline in their pension payments in January.
""I WON'T APOLOGIZE"" 
Sensing an opportunity after several failed attempts to challenge Macron's reforms -- which he says will galvanize a hidebound economy -- the French unions have called a day of protests on behalf of pensioners on Thursday. 
That will provide an indication of what unions hope will become a ""spring of discontent"", with national strikes called for March 22 against the government's plans to shake up totems of the French ""social model"", such as jobs-for-life in public administration and the railways.
But as yet, Macron is showing no sign of following the path trodden by several French leaders before him by backing off from economic reforms under pressure from the streets.
""I know I'm asking for an effort from the oldest, that sometimes some of them grumble,"" Macron said this month on the sidelines of a visit in the Champagne region, where a pensioner publicly complained to him.
""It doesn't make me popular -- but I won't apologize for it,"" he later told reporters, in the combative -- some say arrogant -- manner that has become his hallmark. 
Elysee insiders say they always knew there would be no honeymoon, since Macron decided to launch a whirlwind of reforms targeting vested interests right from the start of his mandate.
Apart from pensioners, his moves to make hiring and firing easier and slash a wealth tax, while putting off increases in welfare spending, have alienated many of the left-leaning voters who switched to him from the mainstream Socialists in 2017, making up almost half his vote.
Just over a third of left-wing sympathizers now support Macron, according to an Ifop-Fiducial poll this month, compared with 43 percent of right-wing voters.
""It's about his policy choices -- but also his style,"" Bruno Cautres, a sociologist at Paris's Sciences-Po university who recently ran a focus group on perceptions of Macron.
""Some of the words used, even by some who voted for him, are particularly negative: 'He's haughty, contemptuous, he likes to show off in international conferences',"" he said.
LOGIC OF HONOR
But Cautres said Macron's reformist zeal and his apparent resolve to break down ""special privileges"" have also run up against a deeper, more entrenched characteristic of the French psyche.
It is what French sociologist Philippe d'Iribarne called the ""logic of honor"" - the pride French feel about the system of rights and duties particular to each working group, inherited from the pre-Revolution era.
""In France, the feeling of having your honor besmirched is one of the strongest impediments to reforms,"" Cautres said, adding that it was especially ingrained among the 5 million public sector workers.
""It's a French cultural trait, forged by history, which is very important. You can't reform the public administration just by using managerial arguments, as Macron is doing.""
In the medieval alleys of Pontoise, which has swung back and forth between left and right in recent decades, they put their view of the young centrist, as he would have it, more bluntly.

""To him, it's: 'I do what I say -- live with it. Whether you agree or disagree -- you voted for me, so that's how it is,'"" said 61-year-old Anita Deliers, a retired administrator. ""He's too much of a neoliberal for my liking.""

(Reuters) - Warda, a Syrian refugee, wishes she could erase her old life, so painful have the memories become. By contrast, as the conflict in Syria slides into its eighth year, her younger children have nothing to remember of their homeland - nor to forget.
They are part of a new generation of Syrians whose parents fled war and destruction in their millions but who themselves are too young to remember their homeland.
For Warda's children, home is a makeshift tent in a refugee camp in Lebanon which they share with their grief-stricken, 34-year-old mother. 
""Even though I know I can't, I want to forget Syria. I would forget my home, I would forget the place where I lived, I would forget my friends - I would forget everything. But one can't forget,"" Warda said as tears ran down her face.
Five million people have fled Syria since the war erupted after anti-government protests were put down with force in 2011. The eight-year anniversary of when these protests began is on March 15. 
Warda and her son Bilal, 13, daughter Rayan, 7, and her youngest, a 3-year-old boy named Ibrahim, are among the one million refugees who stayed in neighboring Lebanon. Most live like them in rickety tents with no running water and inadequate sanitation. 
""When my oldest son and I sit together, we reminisce about the things we used to do, going to the public garden or when I dropped him at school,"" she said. 
""But she doesn’t know what Syria is,"" she said of her daughter Rayan, who sat on her lap.
""She repeats what everyone else says. She says things like: 'when I saw my father' or 'when I met my uncle and grandmother' - but she doesn’t know any of them and it really hurts,"" says Warda, who managed to get work as a fruit picker on nearby farms a few days a week. She earns $5 a day.
Warda has heard nothing of her husband, who remarried and remained in Syria, for the past two years.
OUR CHILDREN DON'T KNOW SYRIA
Moussa Oweid al-Jassem from Aleppo is also struggling to keep the memory of Syria alive for his seven children. His youngest is four years old and the oldest is 16.
""Our youngest knows nothing about Syria, she knows this camp. The children here don't know,"" said Jassem, who is 43 and a former textile factory worker.
His family has nothing to remind them of home or of the lives they lived before. When they left, they had no time to take family albums or even the deeds to the lands they owned, he says.
""We were not prepared to witness the things we have seen. The scale of the violence, the bombings and the airstrikes, we had seen nothing like it before.""
In this small camp on the outskirts of the town of Qab Elias, residents say they are trying their best to make this place feel like a home.
The center of the tented settlement has been kept free to host weddings and wakes, and for the children to play.
On a sunny day, chickens strutted by and a cat looked for scraps as women peeled potatoes and chopped onions on mats spread outside. Black pigeons made nests in tires used as fortifications on tent roofs.
His sons Khaled, 16 and Majed, 14, are among the few whose memories of Syria have not faded completely.
""It felt better than heaven, "" said Majed, when asked to describe what home was like.
What it is like to live in a camp?

""Hell,"" replied Khaled.

Onesmus responded in an interview with the BBC on Monday that slaps are ""fine"" but ""beatings which cause injuries or death"" are unacceptable.
He also told Reuters that he was being comic and that his remarks were misunderstood.

""It is within the framework ... (of the 2018 budget, though) taking into account that we can't spend more than we earn,"" Rajoy told lawmakers, without giving further details. 
Retirees' groups plan to hold marches across the country on Saturday to protest sliding purchasing power for those on state pensions. 
Older people form a large part of the voter base of Rajoy's conservative People's Party (PP).
But support for the party has waned over a series of corruption cases, austerity-focused economic policies and what critics viewed as a heavy-handed response to the Catalan crisis, when Madrid took control of the region in October.
In its second term, Rajoy's government has cut an over-11 percent public deficit to within the EU guidelines of under 3 percent.
It has raised pensions by just 0.25 percent this year, below inflation that stood at 1.1 percent in February.

While the next national election is not due until 2020, polls have shown support for the relatively new, market-friendly Ciudadanos party surge and, in some cases, overtake the PP.

The Black Sea state is a member of the European Union and NATO but deemed RSK MiG the only supplier able to provide reliable support for its MiG 29s, which date to when Sofia was part of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact alliance in the 1980s. Bulgaria therefore did not invite other bidders for the deal.
Sofia has said it needs to keep its Soviet-era aircraft operational after plans to buy eight new fighter jets from a fellow NATO state hit a procedural snag. The process is expected to start almost from scratch later this year.
The Defence Ministry planned to sign a four-year, 81.3-million-lev ($51.45 million) deal with RSK MiG in December but put it off following an appeal by Ukrainian arms exporter Ukrinmash.
Bulgaria's anti-monopoly commission later rejected Ukraine's appeal and a special Defence Ministry commission approved RSK MiG's offer on March 6, according to the documents posted on the ministry's website. 
Some eastern European NATO allies that were once Soviet satellites still rely on Russian-made military jets - two-thirds of Poland's military equipment dates from the pre-1991 Soviet era, for example.
But NATO has encouraged eastern European members to develop, buy and operate new alliance weaponry compatible with older Soviet-era systems.
The question of which warplanes Bulgaria should buy has been vexing successive governments for more than a decade. Sofia has said that between 2018 and 2022 it wants to upgrade to bring its fighter jets closer to compliance with NATO standards.

1195,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Hungarian lawmaker under pressure not to run in April over murky bond deal,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - A senior politician in Hungary's ruling Fidesz party is under pressure from the opposition to withdraw his candidacy in April elections after newspaper reports on his role in a murky 2013 deal involving billions of euros to be invested in Hungarian bonds. 
The reports have stirred up more trouble for Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing Fidesz party, which is seeking a third consecutive term in office in the parliamentary elections on April 8.
Legal documents published in the daily Magyar Nemzet appear to show that Fidesz's Lajos Kosa, a minister without portfolio in Orban's government, was commissioned by an unnamed investor who came to him in January 2013 for advice on how to invest 4.35 billion euros ($5.4 billion) to put the money in Hungarian bonds.
That is equivalent to more than half the 2.4 trillion forints (7.7 billion euros) worth of bonds the government debt agency AKK plans to sell in 2018.
On Wednesday, the same newspaper reported that in a separate document later in 2013 Kosa agreed with the same investor that his mother would accept 2.6 million euros as a gift. It was not clear whether the money was actually transferred to her bank account.
Reuters was not able to verify the authenticity of the document, and Kosa was not immediately available to comment. 
A Fidesz spokesman has not replied to Reuters questions.
In a reply to questions, the government press office referred to Kosa's comments on Wednesday in which he said he would initiate police proceedings against the woman who Kosa said ""carried out a series of frauds...and duped several people including me with a well-built story.""
Despite its domination of Hungarian politics, Fidesz has had its problems and electoral setbacks recently. 
In January an investigation by the European Anti-Fraud Office revealed ""serious irregularities"" in projects co-financed by the European Union in Hungary and run by a company once co-owned by Orban's son-in-law.
On Feb. 25, Fidesz unexpectedly lost a by-election to an opposition-backed independent.
Since then Orban has announced pre-election handouts to millions of families and pensioners in a bid to shore up support among voters.
The opposition Socialist party has called on Kosa to withdraw his candidacy in the election, in which he is seeking to be re-elected as a lawmaker in Debrecen, the second-biggest city in the country.
In a video posted on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page late on Tuesday, Kosa did not deny having signed a document about investing in the bonds. He said that in 2012 a Hungarian woman sought his advice on how best to invest her money, which she said she had inherited.
But Kosa said the investments never took place as the whole proposal turned out to be a scam.
""I never accepted a single penny, my conscience is clear ... and I believe today we already know this was a scam,"" he said in the video. He has not yet reacted to the second document quoted by Magyar Nemzet on Wednesday.
The opposition Jobbik party is trying to set up a parliamentary committee to probe the matter, which they are calling ""Kosa-gate.""

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar has only been able to verify 374 Rohingya Muslim refugees for possible repatriation from Bangladesh, officials said on Wednesday, blaming their neighbor for not providing the correct information about the refugees.
Nearly 700,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar after militant attacks on Aug. 25 sparked a crackdown led by security forces in the western Rakhine state that the United Nations and United States have said constituted ethnic cleansing.
The administration of Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has sought to counter the allegations by forging ahead with development in Rakhine and by readying reception centers and a camp for returnees.
The two countries reached a deal in November to begin repatriation within two months, but repatriation has not begun, with stateless Rohingya, who face restrictions on their movements in Myanmar, still crossing the border.
Myint Thu, permanent secretary at Myanmar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said officials had checked documents handed over by Bangladesh in February relating to 8,032 refugees.
""Out of 8,032, we verified 374. These 374 will be the first batch of the repatriation,"" Myint Thu said at a news conference in the capital, Naypyitaw.
""They can come back when it's convenient for them.""
It was unclear whether the 374 people had agreed to return to Myanmar.
Myanmar was unable to confirm whether the rest of the refugees had previously lived in the country, he said, because some documents did not include fingerprints and individual photographs.
The documents were ""not in line with our agreement"", police Brigadier-General Win Tun said at the same news conference.
Myanmar had found three ""terrorists"" among the people Bangladesh was proposing for repatriation, Win Tun added.
Bangladesh officials have expressed doubts about Myanmar's willingness to take back Rohingya refugees.
Abul Kalam, Bangladesh's Refugee Relief and Rehabilitation Commissioner, said he could not comment in detail because he had not yet received Myanmar's response. But he questioned how more than 300 people could have been verified if the documents were in the wrong format. 
At the Naypyitaw news conference, Myanmar officials sought to counter accusations heard at the U.N. Human Rights Council this week. 
The head of an U.N. fact-finding mission denied visas by Myanmar and a special envoy on human rights in Myanmar who has been blocked from visiting the country, both spoke in Geneva on Monday. Yanghee Lee, the envoy, said atrocities against the Rohingya in Myanmar ""bear the hallmarks of genocide"".
""We have a clear conscience,"" said Aung Tun Thet, coordinator of a public-private partnership set up by Suu Kyi to rehabilitate Rakhine. 
""There is no such thing in our country, in our society, as ethnic cleansing, and no genocide.""

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine's Foreign Minister told Reuters on Wednesday he is ""100 percent certain"" that ties with Washington will remain unchanged with the arrival of Mike Pompeo as U.S. Secretary of State. 
President Donald Trump chose Central Intelligence Agency director Pompeo to replace Rex Tillerson after a series of public rifts with Tillerson on North Korea, Russia and Iran. 
Despite some initial jitters in Kiev about what a Trump presidency could mean for Ukraine, Washington has continued to support Ukraine in its standoff with Russia over the annexation of Crimea and a pro-Russian insurgency in the Donbass region. 
""We have a strategic partnership. This partnership is built on our alliance,"" the minister, Pavlo Klimkin, told Reuters on the sidelines of a press briefing by the presidents of Ukraine and Austria in Kiev. 
""We have the support of both main parties: the Republican and the Democrat. Of course there will be no change in the support of Ukraine -- that's 100 percent certain.""
Some of Trump's comments during the election campaign in 2016, from appearing to recognize Crimea as part of Russia to contemplating an end to U.S. sanctions, had stoked fears in Kiev that Trump would mend ties with Moscow at Ukraine's expense.
But since then, the United States has kept sanctions on Russia, appointed a tough-talking special envoy to the Ukraine conflict and latterly agreed to supply Kiev with lethal defensive weapons despite Russian objections. 
A deal for Ukraine to buy anthracite coal from the United States for the first time has also helped improve Ukraine's relations with the Trump administration. 
Pompeo, a former Army officer, is seen as a Trump loyalist who has enjoyed a less hostile relationship with career spies than Tillerson had with career diplomats. 
Critics expressed dismay at the decision to dump Tillerson ahead of a potential meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and worried that Pompeo would encourage Trump to scrap the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and be hawkish on North Korea.

1204,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 11:37AM ET</span>",Myanmar urged not to drag out case against Reuters reporters,"By Simon Lewis and Shoon Naing
YANGON (Reuters) - Some international observers urged Myanmar on Wednesday not to drag out legal proceedings against two Reuters journalists, as they appeared in court for the 10th time since they were arrested in December and accused of possessing secret government papers.
A Yangon court began preliminary hearings in January to decide whether reporters Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, will face charges under the colonial-era Officials Secrets Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.
Denmark's embassy in Yangon, which has closely followed the case, said ahead of the latest hearing that the journalists should be ""thanked and not punished"" for their reporting on northern Rakhine state - where they found evidence of security forces' involvement in the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men.
""Nor should they be subject to a dragged out trial that appears to be set to last for months while keeping Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo incarcerated, away from their families and their work,"" the embassy said in a statement.
Two civilians that police brought to witness a search of Wa Lone's family home the evening after the reporters were arrested gave testimony on Wednesday.
Min Min, a neighborhood official in north Yangon, told the court he joined nine or 10 policemen searching the residence and signed a form to confirm a laptop with a charger and a bag, a hard drive and a notebook were discovered there.
Asked by defense lawyer Than Zaw Aung during cross-examination whether any government papers were discovered in the search, he said no.
Min Aung, a ward administrator who joined the search and gave testimony, said he could not remember seeing police find official documents.
Lead prosecutor Kyaw Min Aung left the court building before Reuters was able to put questions to him after the hearing. Government spokespeople have declined to comment on the case, citing the ongoing court proceedings.
The government prosecutor has now called 12 of 25 listed witnesses to hearings that have been taking place weekly. The court agreed to hear three witnesses at its next session on March 21. 
HELD IN CUSTODY
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo have been in custody since their arrest on Dec. 12.
The pair had been invited by police officers to a restaurant in northern Yangon. They have told family members they were arrested by plainclothes officers almost immediately after being handed some rolled up papers by the policemen, whom they had not met before.
Previous police witnesses have said they were stopped and searched at a traffic checkpoint by officers who were unaware they were journalists, and found to be holding in their hands documents relating to security force deployments in Rakhine.
Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, wearing handcuffs, were rushed in and out of court by police on Wednesday, giving them only a brief opportunity to talk to their families or reporters. Kyaw Soe Oo was prevented by police from hugging his young daughter.
Myanmar has denied accusations the two reporters were targeted over their reporting in Rakhine, where a security response to insurgent attacks has seen nearly 700,000 Rohingya Muslims flee to Bangladesh since August.
Last week, responding to comments from U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein who said he strongly suspected ""acts of genocide"" had taken place in Rakhine, Myanmar's national security advisor Thaung Tun said the country wanted to see ""clear evidence"" to support such allegations.
Sean Bain, a legal adviser in Myanmar for the International Commission of Jurists, a human rights group made up of 60 senior international judges, lawyers and legal academics, called for the case against the reporters to be dropped.

""The government has asked for 'concrete evidence' of alleged rights violations in Rakhine State,"" said Bain, who attended Wednesday's hearing. ""These journalists produced it, but they remain imprisoned.""

The president nominated Noordin Mohamed Haji to be director of public prosecutions and forwarded his selection to parliament for approval on Tuesday, along with his selection of Paul Kihara Kariuki as attorney general. 
Critics said the choice of Haji, who is the deputy director of the national intelligence service and has no experience as a prosecutor, endangered the independence of the judiciary because the nominee is viewed as a Kenyatta administration insider. 
""The holder of this office should not be someone of his background,"" said activist Okiya Omtatah. ""This is a red flag."" 
""We are very concerned because he is not known within the legal profession,"" said George Kegoro, executive director of the Kenya Human Rights Commission. ""He is associated with the security establishment and he is a political insider.""
Kenyatta's spokesman Manoah Esipisu told Reuters that he picked had the candidate from the three names recommended to him by the selection panel. 
Among those short-listed were senior prosecutors, said Peter Kiama, head of the Independent Medico-Legal Unit, a Nairobi-based rights group. 
The spokesman did not comment on the make-up of the short-list, the finalists nor the identify of those on the selection panel.
""Kenya needs an explanation as to why very experienced and able deputy prosecutors were not chosen for the position,"" Kiama said.
Before joining Kenya's intelligence service, Haji worked in the Attorney General's office in the commercial law department, according to Isaac Okero, president of the Law Society of Kenya. 
""His exposure to the practice of criminal law seems to have been very limited,"" he said. 
The government's adherence to the law was questioned last month after it declined to obey court orders related to a crackdown on opposition figures and the shutdown of TV stations following the mock swearing-in of opposition leader Raila Odinga. 
Kenyatta and the judiciary also clashed publicly last September after the Supreme Court nullified his initial election on Aug. 8 and ordered a re-run, which he won.

The extended elections season blunted economic growth in the region's richest economy and left 100 people dead, mostly from clashes between police and opposition supporters.

LONDON (Reuters) - Facebook (O:FB) said on Wednesday it banned Britain First from its platform for breaking rules against inciting hatred, blacklisting a far-right group brought to global attention when U.S. President Donald Trump retweeted its anti-Islamic posts.
Facebook said it had taken down Britain First's Facebook page and those of its leaders, Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen, for repeatedly violating rules designed to stop the incitement of hatred against minority groups. 
A fringe party, British First shot to the fore last November when Trump sparked outrage in Britain and a sharp rebuke from Prime Minister Theresa May for retweeting British far-right anti-Islam videos.
The removal of the Britain First pages comes as Facebook and other internet firms like Twitter (N:TWTR) and Google (O:GOOGL) are under growing pressure to police their networks, refereeing content to prevent extremist groups spreading their messages and recruiting online.
May has joined forces with the leaders of France and Italy to urge social media companies to do more to remove extremist content. She said on Wednesday that she welcomed the announcement by Facebook.
""I hope other companies will follow,"" she told British lawmakers.
Facebook said it was careful not to remove posts or pages just because they were controversial and some people didn't like them, but said that Britain First had gone further and broken its anti-hatred rules with its anti-Islam posts. 

""We do not do this lightly, but they have repeatedly posted content designed to incite animosity and hatred against minority groups, which disqualifies the pages from our service,"" Facebook said in a blog post.

Turkish media has seized on a tweet purportedly made by Pompeo after a failed coup in July 2016 - and before he became CIA director - which referred to Turkey as a ""totalitarian Islamist dictatorship"". The tweet was later removed.
Relations between the NATO allies had started to improve recently after a visit to Turkey by Rex Tillerson, whom U.S. President Donald Trump sacked on Tuesday as secretary of state. 
Pompeo, seen as a Trump loyalist, had previously headed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Djibouti's container port will remain in state hands as the government seeks investment, a senior official said on Wednesday in comments likely to reassure Washington where lawmakers say they fear it could be ceded to China.
The Doraleh Container Terminal is a key asset for Djibouti, a tiny state on the Red Sea whose location is of strategic value to countries such as the United States, China, Japan and former colonial power France, all of whom have military bases there.
Djibouti last month terminated the concession of Dubai's state-owned DP World to run the port, citing a failure to resolve a six-year contractual dispute. 
The cancellation accelerated diplomatic competition in Djibouti and renewed concerns in a number of capitals that other nations could use it to strengthen their influence.
The port would remain ""in the hands of our nation"" as the government seeks new investors, said Djibouti's Inspector General Issa Sultan, who oversees infrastructure for President Ismail Omar Guelleh.
""There is no China option and no secret plans for the Doraleh Container Terminal,"" he told Reuters in an interview. ""The port is now 100 percent managed by the state.""
The top U.S. general for Africa told U.S. lawmakers last week the military could face ""significant"" consequences should China take control of the terminal. Lawmakers said they had seen reports that Djibouti had seized control of the port to give it to China as a gift.
In one measure of Djibouti's strategic value, Rex Tillerson visited the country last week in his capacity as U.S. Secretary of State. It was one of just five African countries he went to on a tour of the continent.
Tillerson, who was fired on Tuesday by U.S. President Donald Trump, urged the government to improve the investment climate.
""ILLEGAL SEIZURE"" 
DP World called Djibouti's move an illegal seizure. It said it had begun proceedings before the London Court of International Arbitration, which last year cleared the company of all charges of misconduct over the concession.
The Djibouti government says the ports operator deliberately did not develop the container terminal and instead routed transhipments through its Jebel Ali port in Dubai. 
""Our ultimate goal remains to invest strongly in the attractiveness of Doraleh and other port facilities in the country,"" Sultan said.
The port opened in 2009 and has a capacity of 1.6 million tonnes annually that was never met by DP World. In 2016, the company signed a concession to develop a rival port in neighboring Somaliland. 
""It became quite clear that DP World didn't want the port to be developed because it never did more that 50 percent of the capacity,"" Sultan said. ""They were a constraint on the port activity.""
DP World declined to comment on Wednesday, citing ongoing legal proceedings.
Weeks after cancelling DP World's concession, the state-owned company managing Doraleh signed a deal with Singapore-based Pacific International Lines to raise by a third the amount of cargo handled there.

In a sign of growing regional rivalries over DP World's investments, Somalia's parliament voted on Monday to ban the company. It also said DP World's concession to develop the port in the breakaway Somaliland region was void.

Some 1.8 million refugees and migrants have reached Europe across the Mediterranean since 2014, according to U.N. figures, causing friction among member states at odds over how to handle them and lifting support for nationalist and populist parties.
The EU has since been tightening its external borders and asylum laws, as well as offering money and other help to third countries in exchange for preventing people from trekking north. 
A 2016 deal with Turkey, though criticized by rights groups for restricting the chance to claim asylum by those in need, has cut to a trickle arrivals through its soil to EU member Greece.
The EU on Wednesday announced a second tranche of three billion euros for projects benefiting Syrian refugees in Turkey, though the bloc's executive European Commission and the member states must yet agree on the exact financing.
""Our cooperation with Turkey is key to address common challenges,"" Avramopoulos told a news conference, referring to the many rifts between Ankara and the EU, which sees President Tayyip Erdogan as increasingly autocratic. 
""Unnecessary escalations can and should be avoided,"" he said, hoping for a swift return of two Greek soldiers held in detention in Turkey.
Despite heavy criticism of Erdogan's track record on human rights, the bloc's top officials will host him for high-level talks next week, a reminder that many in the EU may dread Ankara but cannot do without it. [nL8N1PX7CR]
DEPORTATIONS
Though the number of people who reached Europe on smugglers' boats since 2014 is small compared to the bloc's population of 500 million, higher immigration caught the EU by surprise and caused political chaos.
It still reverberates, as last seen in the resounding defeat of Italy's center-left in elections this month.
As EU states struggle to become more effective in deporting failed asylum seekers or people who overstay the time allowed, the bloc agreed last June to restrict visas for foreign countries that refuse to take back their nationals.
The Commission proposed on Wednesday to regularly monitor how third countries cooperate on returns and, if it deemed it poor, could recommend the bloc gets tougher on visas for that country in the hope of encouraging a change in policy.
Currently, citizens of 105 countries in the world - from Russia to Congo to Bolivia - need a visa to get into Europe's Schengen zone of free travel and Avramopoulos said 15 million such entry permits had been issued in 2016.
With some African and Asian countries topping the EU's list of problematic returns, the Commission said the bloc was still short of one billion euros for projects to improve life for people in Africa. The bloc hopes such projects would weaken people's resolve to try get to Europe.

""I express my full solidarity with Prime Minister Theresa May in the face of the brutal attack inspired, most likely, by Moscow,"" Tusk told a news conference in Helsinki.
""I'm ready to put the issue on next week's European Council agenda,"" he said.
Asked what measures the EU might take against Russia, he said the EU would wait until Britain itself proposed actions before deciding on a common approach.
Britain is braced for a showdown with Russia after a midnight deadline set by May expired without an explanation from Moscow about how a Soviet-era nerve toxin was used to strike down Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the southern English city of Salisbury on March 4.
Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, also criticized U.S. President Donald Trump's moves to what Tusk called a ""trade war"" and said Russian interference in Western countries showed the need for more, not less, Transatlantic cooperation.

""There is no need to explain the significance of close cooperation between Europeans and Americans at a time when someone on the outside spreads fake news, meddles in our elections and attacks people on our soil with the use of a nerve agent,"" he said. ""There must not be Transatlantic bickering but Transatlantic unity.""

1213,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>","Finland is world's happiest country, U.S. discontent grows: U.N. report","By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Finland is the world's happiest country, according to an annual survey issued on Wednesday that put Burundi at the bottom of the happiness index and found Americans were getting less happy even as their country became richer.
The U.N. Sustainable Development Solutions Network's (SDSN) 2018 World Happiness Report ranked 156 countries according to their scores for things such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, social freedom, generosity and absence of corruption.
Finland, rose from fifth place last year to oust Norway from the top spot. The 2018 top-10, as ever dominated by the Nordics, is: Finland, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland, Netherlands Canada, New Zealand, Sweden and Australia.
The United States came in at 18th, down from 14th place last year. Britain was 19th and the United Arab Emirates 20th.
One chapter of the 170-page report is dedicated to emerging health problems such as obesity, depression and the opioid crisis, particularly in the United States where the prevalence of all three has grown faster than in most other countries.
While income per capita has increased markedly in the United States over the last half century, the happiness index has been hit by weakened social support networks, a rise in perception of corruption in government and business and declining confidence in public institutions.
""We obviously have a social crisis in the United States: more inequality, less trust, less confidence in government,"" the head of the SDSN, Professor Jeffrey Sachs of New York's Columbia University, told Reuters as the report was launched at the Vatican's Pontifical Academy of Sciences. 
""It's pretty stark right now. The signs are not good for the U.S. It is getting richer and richer but not getting happier.""
Asked how the current political situation in the United States could affect future happiness reports, Sachs said:
""Time will tell, but I would say that in general that when confidence in government is low, when perceptions of corruption are high, inequality is high and health conditions are worsening ... that is not conducive to good feelings.""
For the first time since it was started in 2012, the report, which uses a variety of polling organizations, official figures and research methods, ranked the happiness of foreign-born immigrants in 117 countries.
Finland took top honors in that category too, giving the country a statistical double-gold status.
The foreign-born were least happy in Syria, which has been mired in civil war for seven years.
""The most striking finding of the report is the remarkable consistency between the happiness of immigrants and the locally born,"" said Professor John Helliwell of Canada's University of British Columbia.
""Although immigrants come from countries with very different levels of happiness, their reported life evaluations converge towards those of other residents in their new countries,"" he said.

""Those who move to happier countries gain, while those who move to less happy countries lose.""

1214,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 07:31AM ET</span>",Vietnam bar owner said to have arranged meeting of suspects in Kim Jong Nam killing,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A Vietnamese bar owner was asked to act in a video prank show by a man wanted for the killing of Kim Jong Nam, the North Korean leader’s half-brother, but declined the offer, a Malaysian court heard on Wednesday.
In a sworn statement, the bar owner, identified as Nguyen Bich Thuy, said she then introduced the man to a friend and former colleague, Doan Thi Huong, a woman now facing trial in Malaysia for the killing. 
Vietnamese Huong is accused with another woman, Siti Aisyah, an Indonesian, of smearing Kim’s face with VX, a lethal nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur international airport on Feb. 13 last year. 
Defense lawyers say Huong and Siti Aisyah thought they were playing pranks for a reality show and did not know they were poisoning Kim. 
A man who called himself Li had approached Thuy at her bar in Hanoi in December 2016, Thuy said in her affidavit, presented in court by Huong's lawyer, Hisyam Teh. 
Li, who spoke fluent Vietnamese and said he was the child of Vietnamese and Korean parents, told Thuy he was hiring actresses for short films and offered her a role. 
After she refused, she called Huong, who had previously worked with her at another bar, and asked her to meet Li, Thuy said.
""I remembered that Huong loved making films so I introduced Huong to him,"" she said in the affidavit made available to reporters after the hearing. 
Teh submitted Thuy's affidavit during questioning of Wan Azirul Che Wan Aziz, Malaysia's lead police investigator on the case. Wan Azirul had earlier admitted he had not sought witnesses in Vietnam to verify Huong's account to police. 
Teh accused police officials of being biased in their investigation, saying Wan Azirul could have either traveled to Hanoi himself or obtained assistance from Vietnamese authorities to question Thuy. 
""Because you did not take these steps…this failure has been prejudicial to the accused's case,"" Teh said. 
Malaysian police have since identified Li as North Korean Ri Ji Hyon. Ri is among four North Korean men caught on airport cameras fleeing Malaysia on the day of the killing, and Interpol alerts have been issued for their arrest.
Defense lawyers have argued the killing was politically motivated, with many key suspects linked to the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur, suggesting the women were mere pawns. 
Kim had criticized his family’s dynastic rule of North Korea, and his brother had issued orders for his execution, some South Korean officials have said. 

Last week, the United States imposed sanctions on North Korea after formally determining that Pyongyang had used VX to assassinate Kim.

1215,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 07:30AM ET</span>","EU, China urge Taliban to seize offer for talks: EU ambassador","BEIJING (Reuters) - China and the European Union believe the Taliban should seize Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's offer to recognize the movement as a legitimate political group, the EU's special envoy to Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Ghani proposed a ceasefire and a release of prisoners among a range of options, including new elections involving the militants, and a constitutional review for a pact with the Taliban to end a conflict that, last year alone, killed or wounded more than 10,000 Afghan civilians.
The Taliban have not yet given any formal answer to the offer, but U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday during an unannounced visit to Kabul that the United States is seeing signs of interest in talks from elements of the insurgency.
""China and the EU believe that this is an offer that is meaningful. It is an offer that presents an opportunity and a window that should be seized by all parties across the conflict lines,"" EU Ambassador Roland Kobia said after meeting his Chinese counterpart, Deng Xijun, in Beijing. 
""We, as the EU, very much hope that the Taliban will respond to that offer to start discussion,"" Kobia said. 
""In these kinds of scenarios windows open very quickly but they can also close very quickly,"" he said. 
Kobia added that China had various contacts with the Taliban, but he was not aware of the details.
Taliban fighters still control large parts of the country and any new battlefield gains by U.S. and U.S.-backed Afghan forces cannot promise to overcome Afghanistan’s yawning political divisions and entrenched corruption.
Western diplomats and officials in Kabul say contacts involving intermediaries have been underway with the aim of agreeing on ground rules and potential areas of discussion for possible talks with at least some elements in the Taliban.
However, the insurgents, who seized a district center in western Afghanistan this week, have given no public sign of accepting Ghani's offer, instead issuing several statements suggesting they intend to keep fighting.
China has worked with Pakistan and the United States to broker peace talks to end the conflict that has raged since the Taliban were ousted by U.S.-backed forces in 2001.

China has long been concerned that instability in Afghanistan could spill over into its violence-prone far western region of Xinjiang, home to the Muslim Uighur people, where hundreds have died in recent years in unrest Beijing blames on Islamist militants.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A U.N. human rights envoy urged Cambodia on Wednesday to drop a ban on the country's main opposition party so it can take part in a July general election.
Cambodia's Supreme Court dissolved the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) in November and banned more than 100 of its politicians in a ruling that was widely condemned by the international community. 
Rhona Smith, U.N. Special Rapporteur on human rights in Cambodia, said the CNRP ban had denied Cambodians the right to take part in the vote through their chosen representatives.
""I repeat my call on the government to restore the space for any Cambodians to exercise the right to stand for election without fear or intimidation,"" Smith told a news conference.
""I also call for an urgent reconsideration of the blanket ban on 118 political actors,"" she added, referring to the banned lawmakers and senior members of the CNRP.
The CNRP was dissolved at the request of veteran Prime Minister Hun Sen's government, which accused the party of plotting to take power with the help of the United States. The CNRP and the United States embassy in Cambodia denied that.
The dissolution of the CNRP followed the arrest of its leader, Kem Sokha, who was also accused of plotting to take power with U.S. help. 
Kem Sokha said the charge was leveled against him because of the threat the opposition posed at the July elections.
Cambodia's last election, in 2013, marked Hun Sen's toughest challenge in three decades of rule. His party won but with a greatly reduced majority while the CNRP made big gains, despite what it said was widespread cheating.
Western countries have criticized Hun Sen over the CNRP's dissolution and the arrest of Kem Sokha ahead of the general election and some have taken steps against the government.
The United States has imposed visa sanctions on high-ranking government officials while the EU announced in December it would suspend funding for the election. 
Hun Sen's government and its allies have targeted non-government organizations, opposition lawmakers and some independent media in the crackdown.
Smith urged authorities to provide an ""even playing field"" to other smaller parties in the vote. 

A spokesman for Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP), responding to Smith's remarks, said the opposition party was ""dead"".

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore on Wednesday began a public hearing on how to tackle the threat of fake news, with speakers suggesting measures ranging from blocking websites to balancing the interests of national security and free speech.
The wealthy city state is among the countries looking to introduce legislation to rein in fake news, a trend that has stirred concern that such laws could be used to exert government control over media.
A panel set up to consider possible measures, including legislation, drew 164 written responses from the public, a record for reactions to such a committee on any issue.
""Often times, and understandably so, there are worries about how it may stifle the freedom of speech,"" Carol Soon, a specialist in communications and new media at the National University of Singapore, said of legislation.
There should be ""fine balancing of the interests of protecting national security and public order and the interests of enabling people to speak up and have meaningful discussion pertaining to governance"", she added.
She was among 79 people asked to speak in parliament over the eight days set for the hearing, which would make it the longest in Singapore's history.
Many of the examples of fake news cited in a Singapore government paper on deliberate online falsehoods published in January came from abroad.
However, the government said Singapore was vulnerable because of its position as a global financial hub, its mixed ethnic and religious population and citizens' widespread internet access. 
Singapore, which ranks 151 among 180 countries rated in the World Press Freedom Index of Reporters Without Borders, a non-government group that promotes freedom of information. 
""Deliberate online falsehoods are a serious global problem,"" panel chairman Charles Chong, the deputy speaker of parliament, said at the start of the hearing, adding that they affected Singapore in many different ways.
Other speakers urged the Singapore panel to take firm action against fake news.
Mathew Mathews, a social policy researcher at the National University of Singapore, proposed that the government ""stop the access of the local population to media sites which feature deliberate online falsehoods that threaten Singapore's social harmony"".
Others felt such action would be ineffective.
""It is no longer possible to stop 'fake news' simply by blocking websites or publications because social media utilizes person-to-person sharing,"" said Andre Ahchak, communications director in the office of Singapore's Roman Catholic archbishop.
Foreign entities, such as the European Values Think-Tank and the Ukraine Crisis Media Centre, are due to make presentations later in the week.

The incident unfolded on live television during a media session on the sidelines of the National People's Congress (NPC), where high-level officials field often pre-approved questions, mostly from domestic media.
Liang Xiangyi, a TV reporter from financial news outlet Yicai, seemed to find a fellow journalist's long-winded question on China's state asset management too much to bear.
Liang, standing next to the questioner, Zhang Huijun, rolled her eyes, looked Zhang up and down then turned away with another dismissive raising of the eyes.
Zhang works for American Multimedia Television USA, a Los Angeles-based organization which, according to its website, previously had ties to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.
Televised nationwide, the incident was seen by millions and quickly spawned GIFs, video clips and parodies across China's vibrant but tightly controlled social media before many of the postings were removed.
Many netizens declared it the most interesting moment of the tightly orchestrated and largely rubber-stamp NPC session, which has been the most significant in years as parliament voted to remove presidential term limits, enabling President Xi Jinping to remain in office indefinitely.
Some social media commentators praised the apparent spontaneity of Liang's show of frustration.
""Good job. A reporter who comes to the Great Hall of the People unscripted,"" cheered one commentator on Weibo.
An official at Yicai who was not authorized to speak to media, said Liang had been temporarily pulled from the channel's parliamentary coverage team. 
Neither Liang nor Zhang could be reached for comment on Wednesday, and emailed inquiries to both reporters' employers went unanswered.

Britain's accusations that Russia was likely to blame for poisoning Skripal were neither robust nor serious, Lavrov said, describing them instead as a political performance intended to mislead the international community, something which he said Russia will not permit.

LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Most schools and kindergartens in Slovenia were closed on Wednesday for the second time this year as teachers staged another one-day strike for higher wages.
Some 40,000 teachers went on strike, according to their trade union SVIZ, and several thousands are expected to attend street protests in 11 Slovenian cities later on Wednesday. 
The largest protest with up to 2,000 people is due in front of the government building in Ljubljana. Teachers' held their first one-day strike a month ago. [nL8N1Q4540]
""We demand wage hikes of between 8 and 12 percent because gross teachers' wages are about 500 euros per month lower than wages of other public sector employees with similar education,"" Sandi Modrijan, a spokesman of SVIZ told Reuters.
He said the next strike will be held on April 17 unless the government agrees to wage hikes by then.
A number of other public sector trade unions, including nurses, social workers and customs officers, are also threatening strikes, demanding hefty wage increases.
Three months ahead of general election, which is expected on June 10, the centre-left government of Prime Minister Miro Cerar is under heavy public sector wage pressure as trade unions claim economic growth offers room for higher wages.
However, no party has received a direct electoral boost from the strikes.
Slovenia narrowly avoided an international bailout for its banks in 2013 but returned to growth a year later. The government expects the economy to expand by at least 3.9 percent this year versus 5 percent in 2017, boosted by investments and exports of cars, car parts and pharmaceuticals.
The government had said union demands amount to almost 1 billion euros, adding most cannot be met because they are not justified by productivity and GDP growth and would threaten the planned fiscal consolidation.

Slovenia plans to run a budget surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP this year versus a deficit of 0.8 percent in 2017.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's top government spokesman left the door open on Wednesday to a possible summit between Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to discuss the matter of Japanese citizens kidnapped by Pyongyang's agents decades ago.
Abe, who has made the abductees issue a keystone of his political career, will meet U.S. President Donald Trump next month in Washington ahead of a proposed summit between the U.S. leader and Pyongyang's Kim, which would follow a planned April meeting between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.
Worries have surfaced in Tokyo that Japan's interests, including the abductees' fate, may be sidelined by recent moves to resolve the crisis over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.
""It is important to harmonize policies closely among Japan, the United States and South Korea ahead of the North-South summit and the U.S-North Korea summit,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a regular news conference. 
""After that, while liaising closing among the three countries, we will address how to comprehensively resolve the nuclear, missile and abduction issues. Amid that, we want to consider what would be most effective and address the issues from that perspective,"" Suga added.
On Tuesday, a government source said the administration was considering seeking an Abe-Kim meeting. He declined to be identified because he's not authorized to speak to media.
Abe, 63, has said he would not rest until all 13 of the people North Korea admitted to kidnapping have returned and divulges information about the others that Japan suspects were taken to train as North Korean spies.
But progress has largely stalled since 2002, when five of the 13 returned home. Pyongyang said the other eight were dead.
A ruling coalition lawmaker said that it was too early to plan for two-way talks with Pyongyang on the kidnappings.
""The order is a North-South summit, followed by a U.S.-North Korea summit. We have to see how they go first,” said the lawmaker, who is well-versed in diplomatic affairs.
Speculation about a Abe-Kim summit emerges periodically, especially when his ratings are soggy.
Then-premier Junichiro Koizumi, got a popularity boost after his 2002 visit to Pyongyang and in 2004 when he brought back five children of abductees.
Abe is facing perhaps the worst crisis since taking office as doubts swirl over a suspected cronyism scandal centered on the discounted sale of state-owned land to a school with ties to his wife. He has denied wrongdoing either by himself or his spouse.

MELBOURNE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - South Australians go to the polls on Saturday in a tight race with big implications for national politics and foreign investment in a state with the most wind and solar power, but the highest electricity prices in the country.
While its outcome will not dislodge Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, the vote presents a choice between renewable energy, pushed by South Australia's center-left Labor government, and coal, backed by Turnbull's conservative government, which has mocked the state's ""big experiment"" in wind and solar energy. 
South Australia's economy has suffered blow after blow in the last six years, with mining giant BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) scrapping a $20-billion plan to expand its Olympic Dam copper mine in 2012, the collapse of steel maker Arrium and a state-wide blackout in 2016, followed by General Motors' closure of its Holden car plant last year.
Labor, in power for 16 years, has turned to renewable energy luring foreign investors, such as Elon Musk's Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which built the world's biggest lithium-ion battery at a windfarm run by France's Neoen, and British billionaire Sanjeev Gupta, who wants to revive steel works using solar power.
""We're sending, really, a market signal to the world to come to South Australia,"" state premier Jay Weatherill said at the launch of a poll campaign that targets 75 percent of state energy to come from renewables by 2025.
South Australia already gets nearly half its electricity from renewables but has suffered blackouts when back-up power from coal and gas is unavailable.
The plan is a potential bonanza for renewable energy developers as South Australia has the nation's highest power prices, which are a big deterrent to other investors, along with supply reliability concerns. 
""South Australians know that Jay Weatherill is like a problem gambler doubling down to chase his losses on energy policy,"" Josh Frydenberg, the federal energy minister, said in an email to Reuters.
If Labor wins an unprecedented fifth term, it will be a blow to the federal government's plans for a national energy policy that has no renewable energy target but sets requirements for emissions cuts and reliability.
South Australia's Liberal party promises to cut power bills by cancelling Labor's plan for a new gas-fired power plant and fund instead a new power link to a neighboring state, to back up wind and solar power.
""The federal government has proposed its own plan but it requires all the states to sign up. South Australia has refused to go along, concluding it could inhibit their plans for higher renewables,"" said David Blowers, an energy policy specialist at the Grattan Institute think-thank. 
""If the Liberals were to win in South Australia, you would expect the government will get the approval it needs to proceed.""
Labor and Liberals are running almost neck-and-neck, with support of 30 percent and 32 percent respectively, the latest Newspoll on the South Australian election showed.
Clean air is also the hottest issue in a federal by-election on Saturday in Melbourne, capital of the southeastern state of Victoria, where Labor is battling the Greens over the fate of a huge coal project. 

A win for the Greens, Australia's fourth largest political party, would complicate the legislative agenda for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, whose government holds just a one-seat majority.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines said on Wednesday it is withdrawing from the International Criminal Court (ICC) due to what President Rodrigo Duterte called ""outrageous"" attacks by U.N. officials and violations of due process by the ICC.
The decision marks an about-face by Duterte, who initially welcomed a preliminary ICC examination announced last month into a complaint, filed by a Philippine lawyer, that accuses him and top officials of crimes against humanity, committed during a war on drugs that has killed thousands of people.
A 15-page statement, dated March 13 and not signed by Duterte, said the withdrawal from the ICC's founding treaty, the Rome Statute, was ""effective immediately"". 
That was confirmed separately by Duterte's spokesman and his legal counsel, who both said the ICC's examination was part of a plot by the president's enemies.
Duterte's statement said the withdrawal was because of ""baseless, unprecedented and outrageous attacks"" by U.N. officials, and what he said was an attempt by the ICC prosecutor to seek jurisdiction over him ""in violation of due process and presumption of innocence"".
ICC spokesman Fadi el Abdallah referred most questions to the court's prosecutors, who could not immediately be reached for comment.
Duterte's war on drugs has caused international alarm and fierce criticism from some U.N. rapporteurs and officials, including U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, who on Friday said Duterte should submit himself for a psychiatric examination. 
The maverick former mayor has sparred relentlessly with critics and refused to change his approach, or accept that police may have executed suspected dealers, as activists allege. 
Police deny allegations of murder and cover-ups and say they killed about 4,100 drug dealers in shootouts. Police say they have no ties to armed men responsible for the deaths of about 2,300 drug users and peddlers. 
Duterte, who is hugely popular among Filipinos, has no love for the ICC, calling it ""useless"" and ""hypocritical"".
CHANGING TUNE
He at first dared the ICC to indict him, saying he was willing to rot in jail for his people. He then said he would prefer a firing squad to prison.
He has recently changed his tune, telling security forces not to cooperate should there be any international investigation. He last week said the ICC would ""not in a million years"" have jurisdiction. 
The ICC's preliminary examination into the complaint seeks to establish whether crimes have taken place. Such a process typically takes years.
Jude Sabio, the Philippine lawyer who filed the ICC complaint last year, said Duterte's move was predictable, futile and designed to appeal to his base.
""Looks like they are really afraid. Why? They feel that this will proceed to an investigation,"" Sabio told Reuters. 
""His statement is only good for politics, just so his supporters can hear that he is withdrawing from the ICC. But it will have no binding legal effect.""
According to ICC rules, the withdrawal becomes effective one year after receipt of the notification. Duterte and the Philippines are under the jurisdiction of the ICC as a result of being a member, and pulling out would not change that jurisdiction retroactively.
The ICC can only intervene in a member state when that state is unable or unwilling to carry out investigations and prosecute suspected perpetrators. The Philippines says its legal processes are functional and independent. 
Senator Antonio Trillanes, who filed supplementary communications to support Sabio's complaint, said the withdrawal was flip-flopping by Duterte, who ""knows that there is no way out for him in the ICC"".

""Duterte, by withdrawing from the ICC, has practically admitted that he is guilty of the allegations filed against him,"" he said in a statement.

Police gave few details about their investigation in to the camp at Waihi, in the North Island, in a statement on Wednesday. But a police spokeswoman told Reuters the investigation concerned allegations reported in the media.
Four teenagers have accused a 20-year-old man of sexually assaulting them during a party at the camp, according to news website Newsroom, which first reported the story.
""As a result of the incidents at the Waihi summer camp we have taken the decision to immediately suspend all Young Labour events,"" Labour Party President Nigel Haworth said in a statement.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in the party statement that ""serious concerns"" were raised by several attendees ""in relation to sexual misconduct and alcohol"" at the camp, which are often visited by senior Labour politicians and organizers.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore said on Wednesday it was investigating two local companies accused of supplying luxury goods to North Korea in violation of U.N. sanctions.
Citing a leaked draft of a U.N. report, British broadcaster BBC said earlier this week the two firms were OCN and T-Specialist, sister companies that share the same director.
""The Singapore authorities are aware of these cases and we are in correspondence with the U.N. Panel on them,"" Singapore's foreign affairs ministry said in a statement.
""In respect of the two companies mentioned in the BBC report - OCN and T-Specialist – our authorities have commenced investigations into these companies. However, we are unable to provide additional details as investigations are ongoing.""
OCN and T-Specialist could not be immediately reached for comment, neither could lawyer Edmond Pereira who local media reported was representing the firms.
The BBC said the companies have denied wrongdoing.

Under U.N. sanctions, it has been illegal to sell luxury items to North Korea since 2006. Singapore suspended all commercial trade with Pyongyang in November.

1235,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 02:34AM ET</span>",Japan political longevity likely elusive in a post-Abe world,"By Linda Sieg
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made some lasting changes to bolster the power of the premier's office, but his political longevity is mainly due to strong allies, weak enemies and good luck - a hat trick successors may find hard to emulate.
Abe, 63, is in the midst of what may be the worst political crisis since his return to office in December 2012, as doubts swirl over suspected cronyism in a land deal with a school operator linked to his wife, Akie.
He has denied he or his wife intervened in the sale. But the affair could dash Abe's hopes of a third three-year term as governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) president from September, leading to a leadership change sooner than expected.
Among the reforms Abe made was the launch in 2014 of a cabinet bureau giving him and his close aide, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, authority to appoint hundreds of senior officials, tightening their grip on the bureaucracy.
That was the latest in a series of moves over the past two decades to centralize power in the ""Kantei,"" as the prime minister's office is known. 
""Abe is the culmination of changes that began earlier that made clear where the buck stops,"" said Gerry Curtis, emeritus professor at New York's Columbia University. ""After Abe, how the institutions work depends on the individual.""
Abe and Suga have made skilful use of their increased clout. Even before the new system was adopted, for example, Abe named an ex-diplomat sympathetic to his drive to loosen the limits of the pacifist constitution on the military to a post in charge of interpreting that charter.
Abe has assembled a tight inner circle of aides, many of whom have learned from missteps of his first, troubled term in 2006-2007. That tenure ended when he quit abruptly in the face of scandals in his cabinet, a hung parliament and bad health.
""It's an insider group of trusted friends that run a very, very stable ship,"" said Jesper Koll, head of equities fund WelcomeTree Japan. ""In a very un-Japanese fashion, he is not afraid to exercise power and use the institutional framework.""
CARROTS AND STICKS 
Abe has also benefited from a fragmented opposition and voters' memories of the rocky reign of rival Democratic Party of Japan - which has since shattered into three smaller parties. He has led his ruling bloc to three huge wins in lower house elections, helped by a splintering of opposition votes and low turnout.
His ""Abenomics"" recipe for growth, including hyper-easy monetary policy and fiscal spending, has given Japan its longest period of expansion since the 1980s, a fact not lost on voters, although consumption could lose steam and wage growth is weak.
Abe's willingness to risk snap elections - two in the past four years - has helped keep LDP lawmakers in line by forcing them to focus on re-election rather than challenging him, while he has rewarded their constituents with public works spending.
""Prime Minister Abe has been very good ... at both carrots and sticks,"" said University of Tokyo professor Yu Uchiyama.
Some of his strategies, however, such as trying to dampen media criticism by limiting access to information as well as putting bureaucrats in their place, may already be backfiring.
Rivals inside the LDP are also getting feisty feistier, with some speaking out about the suspected cronyism scandal.
""Abe declared war on the media and the media is now getting its revenge,"" said Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University's Japan campus. The conservative Abe's perceived nemesis, the liberal Asahi newspaper, was first to report that the finance ministry had altered documents about the land deal.
""Abe declared war on the autonomy of the bureaucrats, but I'm not betting against the bureaucracy,"" Kingston added.
FINANCE MINISTER 
Likely successors, such as former foreign minister Fumio Kishida and former defense minister, Shigeru Ishiba may not have the right stuff to pull the levers of Kantei power with the same skill as Abe's team, analysts said.
That has some experts worrying that Japan could again see the revolving door premiers of the past.
Japan had five prime ministers in the five years before Abe returned for a second term, and nine between 1989 and 2001, before Junichiro Koizumi managed a five-year term.
""If Abe has to go now, I'd predict that the next prime minister would last less than two years,"" said Koll of WisdomTree Japan. ""Abe is an active prime minister. Whoever comes next will be a passive one.""

1236,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>","Stephen Hawking, who unlocked the secrets of space and time, dies at 76","By Stephen Addison
LONDON (Reuters) - Stephen Hawking, who sought to explain the origins of the universe, the mysteries of black holes and the nature of time itself, died on Wednesday aged 76. 
Hawking's formidable mind probed the very limits of human understanding both in the vastness of space and in the bizarre sub-molecular world of quantum theory, which he said could predict what happens at the beginning and end of time.
Ravaged by the wasting motor neurone disease he developed at 21, Hawking was confined to a wheelchair for most of his life.
As his condition worsened, he had to speak through a voice synthesizer and communicating by moving his eyebrows - but at the same time became the world's most recognizable scientist.
Hawking died peacefully at his home in the British university city of Cambridge in the early hours of Wednesday.
""He was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years,"" his children Lucy, Robert and Tim said. ""His courage and persistence with his brilliance and humor inspired people across the world.""
Hawking shot to international fame after the 1988 publication of ""A Brief History of Time"", one of the most complex books ever to achieve mass appeal, which stayed on the Sunday Times best-sellers list for no fewer than 237 weeks. 
""My original aim was to write a book that would sell on airport bookstalls,"" he told reporters at the time. ""In order to make sure it was understandable I tried the book out on my nurses. I think they understood most of it.""
The physicist's disease spurred him to work harder but also contributed to the collapse of his two marriages, he wrote in a 2013 memoir ""My Brief History"".
In the book he related how he was first diagnosed: ""I felt it was very unfair - why should this happen to me,"" he wrote.
""At the time, I thought my life was over and that I would never realize the potential I felt I had. But now, 50 years later, I can be quietly satisfied with my life.""
FILM PORTRAYAL
U.S. space agency NASA said: ""His theories unlocked a universe of possibilities that we and the world are exploring."" 
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, said: ""We have lost a colossal mind and a wonderful spirit.""
Hawking's popular recognition became such that he appeared as himself on the television show ""Star Trek: Next Generation"" and his cartoon caricature appeared on ""The Simpsons"". He narrated a segment of the opening ceremony of the London Paralympic Games in August 2012, the year he turned 70.
A 2014 film, ""The Theory of Everything"", with Eddie Redmayne playing Hawking, charted the onset of his illness and his early life as a brilliant student.
""We have lost a truly beautiful mind, an astonishing scientist and the funniest man I have ever had the pleasure to meet,"" Redmayne said.
In Cambridge, Hawking's university college Gonville and Caius flew its flag at half mast.
""At Caius he will always be 'Stephen' – the man whose wicked sense of humor enlivened high table dinners and saw him spinning uproariously around hall in his wheelchair to the strains of a waltz at a college party,"" it said in a tribute.
Since 1974, Hawking worked extensively on marrying the two cornerstones of modern physics - Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, which concerns gravity and large-scale phenomena, and quantum theory, which covers subatomic particles.
As a result of that research, Hawking proposed a model of the universe based on two concepts of time: ""real time"", or time as human beings experience it, and quantum theory's ""imaginary time"", on which the world may really run.
""Imaginary time may sound like science fiction ... but it is a genuine scientific concept,"" he wrote in a lecture paper.
He caused some controversy among biologists when he said he saw computer viruses as a life form, and thus the human race's first act of creation. 
""I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive,"" he told a forum in Boston. ""We've created life in our own image.""
Another major area of his research was into black holes, the regions of space-time where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. 
When asked whether God had a place in his work, Hawking once said: ""In a way, if we understand the universe, we are in the position of God.""
PERSONAL LIFE
He married undergraduate Jane Wilde in July 1965 and the couple had Robert, Lucy and Timothy. But Hawking tells in his 2013 memoir how Wilde became more and more depressed as her husband's condition worsened.
""She was worried I was going to die soon and wanted someone who would give her and the children support and marry her when I was gone,"" he wrote.
Wilde took up with a local musician and gave him a room in the family apartment, Hawking said. ""I would have objected but I too was expecting an early death ...,"" he said.
He divorced Wilde in 1990 and in 1995 married one of his nurses Elaine Mason, whose ex-husband David had designed the electronic voice synthesizer that allowed him to communicate. The pair divorced in 2007.
Stephen William Hawking was born on Jan. 8, 1942. He grew up in and around London. After studying physics at Oxford University, he was in his first year of research work at Cambridge when he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease.
""The realization that I had an incurable disease that was likely to kill me in a few years was a bit of a shock,"" he wrote in his memoir. 
In fact there were even advantages to being confined to a wheelchair and having to speak through a voice synthesizer.
""I haven't had to lecture or teach undergraduates and I haven't had to sit on tedious and time-consuming committees. So I have been able to devote myself completely to research,"" he wrote.

""I became possibly the best-known scientist in the world. This is partly because scientists, apart from Einstein, are not widely known rock stars, and partly because I fit the stereotype of a disabled genius.""

1237,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 06:41AM ET</span>","Tokyo bids farewell to 'trustworthy' Tillerson, Seoul awaits seasoned Pompeo","By Linda Sieg and Hyonhee Shin
TOKYO/SEOUL (Reuters) - Japan's foreign minister said on Wednesday he personally regretted the departure of ""frank, trustworthy"" U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson ahead of a proposed summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Trump fired Tillerson on Tuesday after a series of public rifts over policy on North Korea and other issues, replacing him with loyalist Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo.
""He (Tillerson) was a frank, trustworthy counterpart and I thought we would deal with the North Korea issue together, but personally, I feel that this situation that has developed is unfortunate,"" Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono told reporters in Tokyo.
""For sure, America holds the key, so I want to meet his successor as secretary of state soon and exchange views on North Korea and other matters,"" Kono said.
Critics expressed dismay at the decision to swap out top diplomats so soon before the unprecedented potential meeting between Kim and Trump, and worried that Pompeo would encourage Trump to be hawkish on North Korea. 
South Korea's Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha decided to go ahead with a planned trip to Washington to discuss North Korea despite Tillerson's departure, the ministry said in a text message. An official had earlier said she would cancel the visit.
Other South Korean officials, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that while Pompeo was known to have hardline views on North Korea, he was a seasoned politician and seemed to know how to compromise.
""We're aware that Pompeo was one of the strongest voices in the talk of military action and fed Trump related assessments, but things have since changed a lot,"" one senior official said, referring to upcoming inter-Korean talks and the prospect of a Kim-Trump summit. ""So, we will see.""
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China hopes the change in personnel will not impact the development of relations and important areas of cooperation.
""We of course hope that the positive momentum on the Korean peninsula, including the political will for talks of both the United States and North Korea, will be maintained,"" Lu told a daily news briefing.
CHINA CONTACT CRUCIAL
Shares in Japanese defense equipment makers rose sharply on speculation that geopolitical tensions may rise after the firing of Tillerson and Pompeo's appointment.  Ishikawa Seisakusho  (T:6208) surged as much as 15 percent, while Howa Machinery (T:6203) jumped 11 percent.
Jia Qingguo, an expert on Chinese diplomacy at Peking University in Beijing, said China may see positive outcomes from the change when it comes to the U.S. position on the Belt and Road initiative, Chinese President Xi Jinping's signature foreign policy initiative.
""Tillerson has at times been quite critical of China, including of Belt and Road,"" Jia said. ""Trump is not as hawkish on China as many assume. He has tried to communicate and to cut a deal.""
Coming from the CIA, Pompeo is more likely to see China as a threat but his views will probably soften, Jia said.
""Once you are in the secretary of state position, you need to be more pragmatic and take into account the huge stakes involved, so the impact will not be as big as some people expect.""
Most important for China was that Pompeo makes contact with his Chinese counterparts to ensure a smooth meeting between Kim and Trump as soon as possible, said Ruan Zongze, a former Chinese diplomat now with the China Institute of International Studies, a think tank affiliated with the Foreign Ministry.
""Time is short. There are a lot things to do. Every day is very important,"" he said. 
Pompeo is also known for his hawkish views on trade. He takes over as the chief U.S. diplomat as the United States is finalizing the imposition of hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum that have upset a number of Asian trading partners.
Close ally Australia, which is working through an exemption from the U.S. tariffs, welcomed Pompeo's appointment.
""We know him very well,"" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told reporters. ""He's a great friend of Australia. The transition will be absolutely seamless. Our relationship with the United States, as you know, is outstanding at so many levels from the president and myself, right through the military, intelligence, diplomacy and business.""
South Korea is the largest supplier of steel to the United States not to have secured an exemption from the tariffs and is facing pressure from Trump over the two countries' free-trade deal.

""It is our joint understanding with the United States that strong cooperation be maintained through close communication between South Korea and the United States regardless of U.S. personnel changes as there are important issues, including the North Korea nuclear issue, the U.S.-South Korea alliance and trade matters,"" South Korea's Foreign Ministry said.

TOKUSHIMA, Japan (Reuters) - A gaunt, 92-year-old man in a wheelchair sunbathes in a narrow courtyard, motionless, his eyes closed. Nearby, a few dozen other elderly men with short grey hair exercise slowly as an instructor gently calls out, ""Don't strain yourselves.""
The man in the wheelchair is not in a nursing home.
He is in prison, serving a life sentence for murder and rape. The others nearby are serving time for serious crimes too, including murder.
Their prison, in Tokushima, 520 km (325 miles) west of Tokyo, converted a building to house elderly inmates, putting itself at the forefront of an effort to cope with Japan's greying prisoner population.
The number of prisoners aged 60 or older has risen 7 percent from a decade ago to 9,308, and made up 19 percent of the entire prison population in Japan in 2016. That compares with only 6 percent of that age bracket in the United States, and about 11 percent in South Korea.
A sizeable chunk of elderly inmates are repeat offenders, which experts say reflects the difficulties of finding jobs after release and coping with the uncertainty freedom brings. 
""I have a heart condition and used to collapse often at the (prison) factory,"" said an 81-year-old inmate at Tokushima, imprisoned for life for killing a taxi driver and injuring another person six decades ago. Prison rules forbid publishing his name. 
He and about two dozen other prisoners live, eat and work in the special building set aside for elderly prisoners who cannot do regular work such as making shoes and underwear. 
In a rare look inside a Japanese prison, Reuters visited the Tokushima facility and interviewed inmates who spend most of their days in large cells that sleep four or five, engaged in paper-folding projects and other light tasks.
Workers chop up noodles and other foods for those who have difficulty chewing and swallowing. The prison also employs a caregiver trained in working with the elderly for those in its hospital ward, including the 92-year-old man serving a life sentence.
Despite his life sentence, the 81-year-old has been released twice on parole, but wound up back in prison after being caught drinking alcohol, a parole violation. He hopes he will be paroled again so he can see his 103-year-old mother.
""I want to get out of the prison while she's still alive,"" he said. ""That's all I want."" 
NO TALKING
The Ministry of Justice said it didn't have information on what changes prisons have made to adapt to elderly prisoners, as such decisions are up to each facility.
Calls to 13 of Japan's major prisons showed that none of the others has a separate facility where aged prisoners are allowed to sleep and work in their cells, instead of marching every morning to a prison factory. But many have taken steps. 
When the prison in Takamatsu, a city in western Japan, built a new three-story building in 2010, for example, it set aside the first floor for elderly prisoners. There is no difference in the floor level between cells and hallways, to assist inmates with impaired mobility. 
The Tokushima prison tries to ensure that ageing prisoners stay healthy without making conditions too comfortable, said Kenji Yamaguchi, the treatment director there.
Talking is forbidden during working hours, cells have no air conditioning, and prisoners can only bathe twice a week in winter and three times a week in summer.
""As they await their eventual release, we also want to see them leave in good health,"" Yamaguchi said. ""Some may think we are cutting them too much slack. But their freedom is still restricted considerably. It's not exactly a comfortable life.""
'MEALS AND A ROOM'
But returning to life ""on the outside"" can be tough for older men.
About a quarter of inmates 65 and older end up back in prison within two years, the highest of any age group, according to government data tracking those released in 2015.
""If you are young, you can find a job and have a chance to lead a normal life,"" said Yasuyuki Deguchi, a professor at Tokyo Future University. ""The lack of employment opportunities combined with labelling as an ex-convict makes reintegration difficult for the elderly.""
Of those jailed in 2016, 36 percent of those older than 60 were in prison for at least the sixth time, far higher than the 16 percent for all prisoners incarcerated that year. The next biggest group is first-time offenders, who accounted for 29 percent of prisoners 60 and older.
Police data in South Korea show that about 15 percent of those aged 65 or older who committed a crime in 2016 had been convicted at least five times already.
A 71-year-old ex-prisoner who was in jail seven times for theft and fraud said a lack of jobs and shelter drove him to back to crime.
""There are few jobs once you've passed 65. As long as you've got a job and a place to live in, you can get by. Without them, you turn to shoplifting and stealing just to put food in your mouth,"" he said.
""I personally know people who willingly go back to prison,"" said the man, who is staying at a halfway house in Tokyo after being released from prison in October. ""As long as you are in prison, you get meals and a room.""
Seven and a half years through a 13-year sentence for murder, a man in his early 70s in the Tokushima prison said he was already bracing for the day he gets out.
""To be honest, I feel nothing but anxiety,"" he said. ""I have misgivings and concerns that it's going to be difficult adaptation to the outside world. I don't even know anything about smart phones. 

""I must try not to think that I could be better off staying here.""

1240,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 11:40PM ET</span>",Philippine leader demands review of dropped cases vs. alleged drug kingpins,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered a review of a decision by state prosecutors to dismiss complaints against several suspected drugs kingpins, amid outrage among the public and some of his allies about them walking free.
A Department of Justice panel, citing weak evidence, cleared 22 suspects in a decision they made in December but was made public only on Monday in a document leaked to media. A self-confessed drug dealer was among those cleared.
Duterte has publicly named and shamed several provincial politicians and businessmen as ""drug lords"" controlling the narcotics trade in the Southeast Asian nation. Some have been killed in what police said were shootouts. 
""I will invoke my power of supervision and control and will review (the) dismissal,"" Duterte's spokesman, Harry Roque, quoted the president as saying during a joint command conference with police and military officials on Tuesday evening.
Police insisted on Wednesday they had strong cases against the suspects.
Among those cleared were businessman Peter Go Lim and Kerwin Espinosa, who was arrested by Abu Dhabi police in October 2016.
Espinosa's father, Rolando, a mayor in central Leyte province, was killed in what police said was a gunfight in his prison cell three months after he surrendered in August 2016 to answer drugs charges.
Kerwin Espinosa is a self-confessed drug dealer who revealed his suppliers at a Senate hearing in 2016.
Duterte has warned he would put Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre in jail if both Lim and Espinosa go free, Roque said.
Aguirre said in a radio interview the panel's decision was not final and still subject to an appeal and an automatic review by his office. 
However, he said a new panel of prosecutors would be created to review and strengthen the case against the suspects.
More than 4,000 people have been killed under Duterte's 19-month anti-narcotics campaign in what police call legitimate operations against ""drug personalities"" they say violently resisted arrest.
Police have blamed mysterious vigilantes for about 2,300 drug-related homicides.

Duterte's critics have said many of those killed were small-time drug dealers and users from poor communities, while the so-called big fish, or main suppliers, remained at large.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 09:11PM ET</span>",Former South Korean president Lee appears for questioning over graft charges,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Former South Korean president Lee Myung-bak appeared for questioning on Wednesday over allegations he took bribes when he was in office, following months of investigations into his family and acquaintances over the graft charges.
Lee made his way before hundreds of reporters waiting outside the prosecutors' office to ask him questions in the latest top-level political corruption scandal to rock the country.
""I stand before you today with a tragic heart. I offer my deepest apology to the people for causing worry amid times when the economy is in hardship and the situation surrounding the Korean peninsula is serious,"" Lee said. 
""I have much to say as a former president, but I keep telling myself I should refrain from saying much,"" he added. 
Lee faces almost 20 charges and the prosecution believe he took around 11 billion won unlawfully from a number of institutions and individuals including the country's National Intelligence Service and Samsung Group (SAGR.UL).
Prosecutors last month sought a 30-year jail term for former president Park Geun-hye, Lee's successor, who was ousted last year amid an influence-peddling scandal and is standing trial on charges of bribery, abuse of power and coercion.
Lee has denied any wrongdoing, calling the investigation into the bribery allegations politically motivated by prosecutors under the incumbent liberal administration. The former president was in office from 2008 to 2013 before his successor, Park, won her presidency.
Last month, Seoul prosecutors searched the offices of Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) as part of the investigation, the prosecutors' office said.
They were looking for possible evidence that Samsung provided financial support in litigation fees for an auto parts maker called DAS, run by Lee's family and allegedly controlled by him, the prosecutors' office said. Samsung has offered no official comment on the matter.
Lee has said DAS is run by his elder brother, Lee Sang-eun.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain braced for a showdown with Russia on Wednesday after a midnight deadline set by Prime Minister Theresa May expired without an explanation from Moscow about how a Soviet-era nerve toxin was used to strike down a former Russian double agent.
The United States, European Union and NATO supported Britain after May said it was ""highly likely"" that Russia was behind the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novichok, a nerve agent developed by the Soviet military.
Russia, which denied any involvement, said it was not responding to May's ultimatum until it received samples of the nerve agent, effectively challenging Britain to show what sanctions it would impose against Russian interests.
""Moscow will not respond to London’s ultimatum until it receives samples of the chemical substance,"" Russia's embassy in London said. ""Any threat to take punitive measures against Russia will meet with a response.""
A spokeswoman for the British Foreign Office declined immediate comment. 
Britain could call on Western allies for a coordinated response, freeze the assets of Russian business leaders and officials, limit their access to London's financial center, expel diplomats and even launch targeted cyber attacks. 
It may also cut back participation in the soccer World Cup, which Russia is hosting in June and July.
Russia is due to hold a presidential election on Sunday in which Vladimir Putin, himself a former KGB spy, is expected to coast to a fourth term in the Kremlin. He was first installed as Kremlin chief by Boris Yeltsin on the last day of 1999.
U.S. President Donald Trump told May by telephone that Russia ""must provide unambiguous answers regarding how this chemical weapon, developed in Russia, came to be used in the United Kingdom,"" the White House said.
The White House said Trump and May ""agreed on the need for consequences for those who use these heinous weapons in flagrant violation of international norms.""
A British readout of the conversation said, ""President Trump said the US was with the UK all the way.""
May is expected to outline Britain's response in the British parliament on Wednesday after a meeting of Britain's National Security Council.
""MILITARY-GRADE NERVE AGENT""
Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were found slumped unconscious on a bench outside a shopping center in the genteel southern English city of Salisbury on March 4. They have been in a critical condition in hospital ever since.
Scientists at Britain's military research laboratory at Porton Down identified the poison as a military-grade nerve agent from a group of chemicals known as Novichok, which was first developed in the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s.
May said that either the Russian state had poisoned Skripal, a former officer with Russia's GRU military intelligence, or that Russia had somehow lost control of its chemical weapons. Putin said last year that it had destroyed its last stockpiles of such weapons. 
A Russian chemist who helped develop the nerve agent said only the Russian government could have carried out the attack with such a deadly and advanced toxin.
Vil Mirzayanov, 83, said he had no doubt that Putin was responsible, given that Russia maintains tight control over its Novichok stockpile and that the agent is too complicated for a non-state actor to have weaponized.
“The Kremlin all the time, like all criminals, denying - it doesn’t mean anything,” Mirzayanov said in an interview in his home in Princeton, New Jersey, where he has lived in exile for more than 20 years.
Skripal betrayed dozens of Russian agents to British intelligence before being arrested in Moscow and later jailed in 2006. He was released under a spy swap deal in 2010 and took refuge in Britain. 
Russian state television said Skripal had been recruited by the British when working as Russia's military attache in Spain and that he had handed over 20,000 pages of secret documents to London.
Since emerging from the John le Carre world of high espionage and betrayal, Skripal lived modestly in Salisbury and kept out of the spotlight until he was found unconscious.
A British policeman who was also affected by the nerve agent is now conscious in a serious but stable condition.
May said Russia had shown a pattern of aggression including the annexation of Crimea and the murder of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, who died in 2006 after drinking green tea laced with radioactive polonium-210.
A public inquiry found the killing of Litvinenko had probably been approved by Putin and carried out by two Russians, one of them a former KGB bodyguard who became a member of the Russian parliament. Both denied responsibility, as did Moscow.
Counter-terrorism officers began investigating the death of another Russian in Britain on Tuesday, although police said it was not thought to be linked to the attack on the Skripals.
Nikolai Glushkov, 68, who was an associate of late tycoon Boris Berezovsky, was found dead on Monday. Berezovsky was found dead in March 2013 with a scarf tied around his neck in the bathroom of his luxury mansion west of London.

Berezovsky's death, which police and forensic experts concluded was suicide although a coroner said he could not rule out foul play, is one of 14 deaths in Britain linked to the Russian state in recent years, which interior minister Amber Rudd said authorities would look at again.

The British region has been without a devolved executive - a central plank of its 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of violence - since Irish nationalists Sinn Fein pulled out in January last year, saying they were not being treated as equal partners by the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). 
Each side has blamed the other for repeated failures to reach a deal, the most recent triggering the imposition of a budget directly by London in the latest step toward reimposing direct rule of the region.
Acknowledging that the impact of Brexit negotiations on the future of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland had complicated the political talks in Belfast, Varadkar called for a fresh round once EU leaders endorse a joint stance on their future relationship with Britain on March 23.
""The next few weeks will rightly see a focus on Brexit. ... We face enormous challenges from Brexit, which has undoubtedly changed the political climate in Northern Ireland,"" Varadkar said in the text of a speech due to be delivered at an event in Washington celebrating 20 years of peach in Northern Ireland.
""After that, I believe the period after Easter (April 1) should see a redoubled effort on the part of both Governments and all of the parties in Northern Ireland to seek agreement on the restoration of the institutions.""

Describing the lack of a devolved government as ""corrosive and damaging"" for the province, Varadkar said the governments may need to present their own proposals to help the parties break the deadlock, as they have successfully done in the past.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Tuesday hosted 19 nations, including Israel and Arab Gulf states, to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, but the Palestinian Authority boycotted the meeting, angered by the Trump administration's policies on Jerusalem. 
U.S. President Donald Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy in December, when he decided to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move the U.S. embassy there from Tel Aviv. This incensed Palestinians and other U.S. allies.
The administration is also putting the final touches on a Middle East peace plan, and U.S. officials said the conference was integral to future negotiations. 
“Fixing Gaza is necessary to achieve a peace agreement,” one of the senior administration officials said. The officials stressed that the multi-nation humanitarian and reconstruction effort remains in beginning stages.
Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to Trump who is overseeing the Israeli-Palestinian peace-process for the White House, gave a two-hour presentation to the attending countries, officials said, but the potential U.S. peace plan was not addressed. 
Attendees included representatives from Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as several European nations. The format did not allow for direct discussions between Israel and the Arab states, officials said. 
Potential electricity, water, sewage, and health projects were discussed, but officials declined to outline specific proposals. A senior administration insisted that many projects could be implemented without assistance of the Palestinian Authority, but the goal was to have it ultimately engage in the multi-lateral process.
Gaza faces a 43.6 unemployment rate, and many in Gaza blame Israel for the hardships, accusing it of placing an economic blockade on the enclave that has drastically reduced movement of people and goods.
But Gazans also fault their own leaders, complaining of a power struggle between Hamas, the armed group that seized military power in Gaza in 2007, and Fatah, the secular party of Western-backed Palestinian President Abbas.
Israel, which pulled its settlers and soldiers out of Gaza in 2005, says it has been forced to control access to and from the territory to prevent Hamas from sending out gunmen and bombers, and from smuggling in weapons or material to make them.

The Palestinian Authority’s prime minister, Rami Hamdallah, escaped an apparent assassination attempt in Gaza on Tuesday, when a bomb struck his convoy. Hamas and the Palestinian Authority signed an agreement in October that called for the Islamist group to hand administrative control of Gaza to the Authority, but it remains to be fully implemented.

1245,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 05:27PM ET</span>","With Pompeo's rise, uncertainty deepens for Iran nuclear deal","By Arshad Mohammed, John Irish and Robin Emmott
WASHINGTON/PARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - It is unclear how Mike Pompeo becoming U.S. secretary of state may affect the Iran nuclear deal given that there is only one voice that counts in President Donald Trump's administration: his own.
Trump's choice of the Central Intelligence Agency director to replace Rex Tillerson means an Iran hawk who fiercely opposed the 2015 pact as a member of Congress will now be in charge of the U.S. diplomacy trying to strengthen, and perhaps save, it.
Former U.S. officials and serving European officials were at a loss to gauge how the switch would affect negotiations between the United States and three European powers - Britain, France and Germany - that are also parties to the agreement.
Some said Washington may take a harder line under Pompeo and the Europeans may be under more pressure to offer concessions, while others suggested his views on the deal have evolved and he may be better placed to influence Trump to keep it. 
U.S., British, French and German officials are due to meet on the deal in Berlin on Thursday.
""Any officials negotiating with the Europeans right now will get a much more aggressive set of requirements from Pompeo,"" said Richard Nephew, a former White House and State Department official who worked on Iran during the Obama administration.
""The odds of them coming up with a thoughtful compromise by May just got a lot longer,"" he added.
Trump on Tuesday singled out the Iran nuclear deal as one of the main differences he had with Tillerson.
""I think it's terrible, I guess he thinks it was OK,"" Trump said.
Trump delivered an ultimatum to the European powers on Jan. 12, saying they must agree to ""fix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear deal"" or he would refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief on Iran that it calls for. U.S. sanctions will resume unless Trump issues fresh ""waivers"" to suspend them on May 12.
The crux of the July 2015 pact between Iran and six major powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - was that Iran would restrict its nuclear program in return for relief from sanctions that have crippled its economy.
Trump sees three defects in the deal: its failure to address Iran's ballistic missile program; the terms under which international inspectors can visit suspect Iranian nuclear sites; and ""sunset"" clauses under which limits on the Iranian nuclear program start to expire after 10 years. He wants all three strengthened if the United States is to stay in the deal.
In a Jan. 13 cable, the State Department sketched out a path under which the three European allies would simply commit to try to improve the deal over time in return for Trump keeping the pact alive by renewing sanctions relief in May.
TRUMP ""IS WHAT MATTERS HERE""
Other European officials and former U.S. officials said Pompeo's rise, if he is confirmed as secretary of state by the Senate, might have a more ambiguous effect on the negotiations and that, in any case, Trump's views are paramount.
""All our work is going into delivering a credible package that is sellable to Trump,"" said a European diplomat on condition of anonymity. ""He is what matters here.""
While Pompeo was a fierce critic of the deal, called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as a congressman, he tempered his views when testifying before Congress in January 2017 to seek confirmation as CIA director.
""Pompeo was a hawk on Iran. However, my understanding is he doesn’t want the deal to disappear,"" said a former senior U.S. official. ""People should not jump to conclusions.""
Many of Trump's top national security aides, like Tillerson, have argued that the United States is better off with the Iran nuclear deal than without it. That stance was echoed on Tuesday by the U.S. general who heads the U.S. military command responsible for the Middle East and Central Asia.
Former U.S. officials suggested that, as the administration nears a planned summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un about Pyongyang's nuclear program, it could rethink its stance on the Iran deal.
European diplomats saw some chance Pompeo may have more influence over Trump than Tillerson, who antagonized the U.S. president by reportedly calling him a ""moron"" and who differed with Trump on Iran and other issues. 
""If Pompeo is that hawkish, then in reality all it is is the affirmation of Trump’s policies. It’s Trump’s line,"" said a another European diplomat. ""Hopefully he’ll have the mandate that Tillerson didn’t have.""

Opposition leader Julius Maada Bio of the Sierra Leone People's Party led the field of 16 candidates with 43.3 percent in the first round of the vote, held last Wednesday, according to results announced by the commission in the capital Freetown. 
Maada Bio, who briefly ruled the West African country as head of a military junta in 1996, will square off against first-round runner-up Samura Kamara of the ruling All People's Congress, who took 42.7 percent.
The runoff will take place on March 27, the commission said. 
Koroma is stepping aside after his maximum two terms in office. The largely peaceful vote to replace him came as a relief for the country of seven million people, which endured a brutal, diamond-fuelled civil war in the 1990s.

But the winner will face pressure to revive a moribund economy that has been ravaged in recent years by low prices for its main export, iron ore, and an Ebola outbreak.

ABUJA (Reuters) - A Nigerian group that sparked a global campaign for the safe return of schoolgirls kidnapped in 2014 said on Tuesday it would sue the government if it failed to provide answers over a similar mass abduction last month. 
Islamist militant group Boko Haram took 110 schoolgirls from the northeastern town of Dapchi on Feb. 19. and, under a previous administration, it kidnapped 276 girls from the town of Chibok in 2014.
""The magnitude of incompetence and carelessness of our government enabled the repeat of the worst abduction tragedy,"" said campaign group Bring Back Our Girls (BBOG).
The campaign group was formed in the wake of the Chibok abduction and it submitted questions about the Dapchi kidnapping to President Muhammadu Buhari's government.
BBOG challenged the government over how Boko Haram could have staged the attack, given that the administration and the military say the insurgent group is defeated.
They said the Dapchi school was unprotected despite a Safe Schools Initiative set up in 2014 and the military had earlier withdrawn from the town at an unspecified time. The school is located in northeast Nigeria, the heartland of the insurgency.
The campaign group also asked why the government said in its initial response to the Dapchi incident that there was no evidence of abduction and why parents were later told more than 70 girls had been returned, information that proved false.
""Our questions are premised on the troubling sparseness of information ... by the federal government,"" BBOG said in a statement. A Nigerian presidency spokesman declined to comment.
Boko Haram has killed 20,000 people since 2009 but it no longer holds the large tracts of territory that it did in late 2014. Even so, it conducts raids in remote areas, making it hard for security forces to defend people in areas largely cut off from the rest of the country.
If the administration fails to respond within seven days BBOG will sue the government for gross negligence that led to the Chibok abductions, the group's founder, Obi Ezekwesili, told reporters in the capital Abuja. 
Similar criticisms were leveled by Buhari's then-opposition party at the administration of former president Goodluck Jonathan after the Chibok kidnapping.

Some Chibok girls have been freed after what security sources say were ransom payments but around 100 are still being held.

1249,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",Israeli government ends feud that sparked snap election talk,"By Maayan Lubell
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's government settled a dispute on Tuesday that had threatened its survival and prompted speculation that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was seeking a snap election to help him dodge a corruption probe. 
The cabinet dispute was over the framing of a bill that would extend a long-standing exemption from military service for ultra-Orthodox Jewish seminary students. For days, coalition parties had been unable to agree on the draft law.
About an hour before the preliminary vote on the bill, Netanyahu's office said agreement had been reached and that the legislation would be finalised after April, when the Knesset returns from a break that begins this Sunday. 
The coalition heads had agreed to work in accord to keep a stable government that would rule for a long period, the statement said. 
""We have decided to continue together for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and for the benefit of the state of Israel,"" Netanyahu told parliament. 
Since the crisis began, coalition and opposition lawmakers, ministers and political analysts had been saying it was merely a pretext, and that Netanyahu actually preferred to let the government unravel, prompting an early election.
However, some of Netanyahu's coalition partners said they did not want an early election and pushed for a solution.
The next election is not due until November 2019. A snap poll that produced a strong vote for Netanyahu despite the corruption allegations might make it harder for the attorney-general to indict him in two graft cases, as police recommend.
Recent opinion polls have shown strong backing for his right-wing Likud party, even as he faces the prospect of bribery charges in those investigations, suspicions of corruption in at least one other case, and testimony by three former aides who have turned state’s witness. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.
The attorney-general's call on whether to charge Netanyahu could take months and the prime minister's key coalition partners have so far said they will stick by him until that decision is made.
Polls in both Israel's leading television news shows on Monday indicated that, while Netanyahu's Likud had strong support, his majority in parliament would be razor-thin as some of his present coalition partners would lose seats.

1250,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 03:09PM ET</span>",Out in Africa? Tillerson trip leaves hosts nonplussed,"By Ed Cropley
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - From the outset, Rex Tillerson's first trip to Africa looked half-hearted and token, but with the hindsight knowledge that the U.S. Secretary of State was fired just two days in, his African hosts who must be wondering why they bothered.
Beyond $533 million in humanitarian aid and some pat remarks about security and not getting too cosy with China, Tillerson's main aim appeared to be clearing up the mess left by President Donald Trump's reported dismissal of some African nations as ""shithole countries"". Trump later denied making the comment. 
But the revelation from a senior White House official that Trump told Tillerson he was out of a job just two days into the six-day jaunt leaves little room for doubt about the Trump White House's attitude towards the continent.
Given its increasing reliance for aid and trade on China, its main commercial partner, and a recent diplomatic push led by Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, the slight is likely to have real consequences for Washington's status on the continent of a billion people.
""This shows Trump's disdain - a real own-goal, especially with Lavrov hot on his heels,"" said Jackie Cilliers, head of the South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies.
After a brief appearance at the African Union headquarters in Ethiopia, where he spoke of the need for care when doing business with China, Tillerson flew to the Horn of Africa state of Djibouti, then Kenya, an important east African ally.
His presence in Nairobi on Friday smoothed the way for a kiss-and-make-up meeting between President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga.
It was downhill from there. Tillerson's focus switched to a possible summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un - and trying to keep his job.
On Saturday, he pulled out of his activities in Nairobi, citing ill health, before flying to Chad and Nigeria. His time with leaders there on the front line of the fight against Boko Haram was cut short by the need to get home a day early.
Only hours after he touched down in the United States, Trump announced on Twitter that Tillerson was fired.
For Kenya's chattering political classes, it was a telling window into the priorities of the Trump White House.
""It'd be better for Africa if the Trump administration just ignored us because of the chaos and dysfunction within the administration,"" said Nanjala Nyabola, a Kenyan writer and political analyst.
""It's interesting and disturbing to see the administration flounder so much and not really have a coherent response to any major challenges on the continent and elsewhere.""
A spokesman for Kenya's president declined to comment. Nigeria's foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
In Nigeria - where Tillerson held talks with President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday - the secretary of state's ousting was met with a sense of weary acceptance.
""American foreign policy has always treated Africa as a leftover, which is why it's not a huge shock that Tillerson was in Africa while they fired him,"" said Pat Utomi, professor of political economy at Lagos Business School. 
""It doesn't augur well for the long-term message of America to Africa, especially with the message he sounded, which was 'beware of China'. This means that the warning he was giving was of no consequence,"" said Utomi.

GENEVA (Reuters) - U.N. investigators of war atrocities in South Sudan urged the African Union (AU) on Tuesday to make a final push to secure justice for millions of victims. 
Oil-rich South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 but slid into civil war in December 2013, with President Salva Kiir's army battling rebels under his ex-deputy Riek Machar.
Under a 2015 peace deal that fell apart in 2016, the AU and South Sudan were supposed to set up a ""hybrid court"" consisting of South Sudanese and other African judges, to try people accused of atrocities. But the court has yet to be created.
""The hybrid court of South Sudan is but a signature away. The African Union needs to act with great urgency,"" Yasmin Sooka, chair of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, told the 47 member states of the rights council in Geneva. 
The court was an African solution to an African problem, Sooka said, but the AU had told her that they were waiting for South Sudan to designate a government official to sign a memorandum of understanding on the court. 
""Once that has happened, then the path is free to set up the court immediately. Once that has been done, a prosecutor can be appointed, judges can be designated, and the rules of procedure can begin to be formalized,"" she said.
Sooka's team has identified more than 40 South Sudanese military officers who may be responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
South Sudanese Justice Minister Paulino Wanawilla Unango told the Council that Sooka's report was generalized and flawed.
""There is actually improvement in the security and human rights situation,"" he said, without mentioning the memorandum. 
He said there had been 203 cases against members of the army for serious crimes including murder and rape, and some had been jailed. ""It is not true that there is impunity and (that) there is not any kind of accountability.""
Sooka warned in late 2016 of a ""Rwanda-like"" genocide and said rape was taking place ""on an epic scale"" in South Sudan. Although talk of genocide has subsided, Sooka said barbarities were continuing and she provided some graphic testimony.
""A mother had her eyes gouged out with spears as she tried in vain to prevent her 17-year old daughter from being raped by 14 soldiers,"" she told the Council.
""After being blinded, she herself was raped by 17 soldiers. Her husband was later found by his son, beheaded and castrated, with his penis stuffed in his mouth,"" Sooka said.

Last month Freedom Party leader and Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache posted a picture on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) of the TV news anchor, Armin Wolf, with the inscription: ""There is a place where lies become news. That place is ORF.""
In a speech the next day, Strache, who has long accused ORF of left-wing bias, said the posting was a prank since it was labeled ""Satire!"" He also said he wanted to scrap the license fee that funds ORF and force it to report ""objectively"" as part of government plans to reform the broadcaster. 
Wolf, the presenter, filed a defamation suit against Strache before a criminal court, after which ORF took the exceptional step of filing its own civil suit against the vice chancellor. Strache's party is the junior coalition partner to Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conservatives.
""My aim was not to drag a politician before the courts but to make clear that ... there are limits to criticism of the work done by journalists and the media, namely the point at which it becomes personally defamatory,"" Wolf said in a blog posting announcing that he had reached a settlement with Strache.
""Mr Strache has now accepted these limits and he will also announce that to a large public audience,"" Wolf said, showing a text Strache had agreed to pin to the top of his Facebook page for 10 days and have published on page 3 of the country's top-selling tabloid. 
Wolf said he had rejected an initial settlement offer presented by Strache's lawyer but accepted this one because it was preferable to a legal conflict that could have lasted years. 
A spokesman for Strache confirmed that a settlement had been reached but declined to elaborate. ORF welcomed the agreement but said its own settlement talks with Strache over its civil suit were continuing.
""This assertion was incorrect and I apologize to Armin Wolf and the employees of ORF for this unfounded statement,"" the text Strache had agreed to post says, according to Wolf's blog. It also says Strache withdraws his assertion.
Strache also agreed to pay Wolf's legal costs plus 10,000 euros ($12,400), Wolf said. He added that he would donate the lump sum to the Documentation Centre of Austrian Resistance, an archive and research organization that examines the Holocaust and other Nazi-era crimes.

Michael Satz, the state attorney for Broward County, filed the notice with Judge Elizabeth Scherer of his office's intent to seek the death sentence, ahead of a court hearing on Wednesday. 
The notice cited multiple reasons under Florida law for the death penalty. Those included the charges that Cruz ""knowingly created a great risk of death"" to many people, the shooting was ""especially heinous, atrocious or cruel,"" and it was committed in a ""cold, calculated and premeditated manner.""
Cruz has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder and 17 counts of attempted murder for the attack on Feb. 14 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in which 14 students and three staff died.
After the filing, Cruz's attorneys repeated their offer for Cruz to plead guilty if prosecutors agreed to not pursue the death penalty. Cruz is due to appear in court in Fort Lauderdale on Wednesday for his arraignment, where he will be formally asked to plead to the charges.
""We still stand ready to immediately plead guilty to 34 consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole,"" Howard Finkelstein, a county public defender, wrote in an email. ""If we are not allowed to do so tomorrow, we will stand mute to the charges.""
Standing mute means the defendant will not plea either ""guilty"" or ""not guilty."" Cruz's lawyers have said they have taken this approach to avoid upsetting survivors and families of victims with the ""fiction"" of a not guilty plea. The court is expected to enter a not guilty plea on Cruz's behalf, Finkelstein said.
""We are not saying he is not guilty but we can't plead guilty while death is still on the table,"" Finkelstein wrote.
Daniel Reed, a parent of a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas who initiated a petition drive seeking to have Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) remove the National Rifle Association's channel from its offerings, said he was opposed to the death penalty for Cruz.

""I don't think death will bring back the lives of the 17 people who were killed and it certainly doesn't solve our ongoing issue ... when it comes to gun violence,"" Reed said.

The French government has faced growing criticism at home over its response to developments in northern Syria where Turkey launched its operation ""Olive Branch"" nearly two months ago to sweep Syrian Kurdish YPG militants from the border.
""While concerns over border security are legitimate... at the same time ... It must be said that it absolutely does not justify the deep incursion of Turkish troops in the Afrin zone,"" Jean-Yves Le Drian told lawmakers in parliament.
""The situation is critical and serious,"" he said, adding that Paris feared the Turkish operation was also weakening the action against Islamic State militants.
France, like the United States, has extended arms and training to a YPG-led militia in the fight against Islamic State in Syria, and also has dozens of special forces based in the region. That has infuriated Turkey, which considers the YPG an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
Former president Francois Hollande, who originally gave the green light for French support to the Kurds, on Monday bemoaned incumbent Emmanuel Macron's Syria policy, in particular his attitude to the Kurds.

Turkey's military and rebel allies have encircled Afrin, its military said on Tuesday, a substantial advance in its campaign.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based organization that reports on the war, said an estimated 700,000 people in Afrin and nearby were now encircled.

""The main reason for our determination on this subject is that we have a very old relationship with the Kurds and we recognize the vital role they played in retaking Raqqa,"" Le Drian said, referring to Islamic State's former Syria bastion.

Ofcom has an ongoing duty to check that holders of broadcast licenses remain ""fit and proper"" to operate in Britain. 
The regulator said it had written to ANO TV Novosti, the holder of RT's UK broadcast licenses, to explain that, should Britain determine there was unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the UK, it would consider this relevant to the ""fit and proper"" test. 

Ofcom said ANO TV Novosti was financed from the budget of the Russian Federation. Britain has given President Vladimir Putin until midnight on Tuesday to explain how a nerve agent developed by the former Soviet Union was used to strike down Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, in the city of Salisbury.

The small and impoverished Central Africa nation has been rocked by insecurity since 2015, when Nkurunziza decided to seek a third term in office that his opponents said was unconstitutional.
The country is due to hold a referendum in May on whether to amend the constitution to extend presidential terms to seven years from five. The proposed changes would limit the president to two consecutive terms but would not take into account previous terms, potentially extending Nkurunziza's rule to 2034.
Evariste Ndayishimiye, secretary general of the ruling CNDD-FDD, told a press conference in the capital Bujumbura that the party had decided to give Nkurunziza the title of ""CNDD-FDD Party Visionary"" after appraising his ideas and teachings. 
The title has no specific role attached to it and appeared to be aimed at shoring up support for the president ahead of the referendum.
Ndayishimiye said the party has also started ""working on his ideas"".
On social media, some Burundians said the announcement was likely a step toward Nkurunziza seeking a life presidency.
Several leaders around Africa have sought to void laws or use other tactics to thwart opponents and prolong their reigns beyond constitutional limits, sometimes for decades.
Those who opposed Nkurunziza's third five-term launched an armed struggle against his government, and the resulting violence has left hundreds dead and forced at least 400,000 people into exile.

Regional efforts to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict have dragged on without results so far.

1260,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",Shutdown of funeral home that also ran body brokerage roils town,"By Duff Wilson and Reade Levinson
MONTROSE, Colorado (Reuters) - After Gerald “Cactus” Hollenback died of heart disease last May, his wife contacted Sunset Mesa Funeral Directors here to have him cremated. Now, Shirley Hollenback is worried about what became of her husband’s body. 
In a lawsuit filed against Sunset Mesa and its owner, Megan Hess, Hollenback alleges that the ashes she received are not from her husband, a former U.S. Marine who died at age 81.
Instead, she fears that all or parts of Cactus Hollenback’s corpse may have been sold by a side business Hess ran from the funeral home: a so-called body broker company called Donor Services. Hollenback is among dozens of people in this remote Rocky Mountain town concerned about what became of friends and family whose funerals or cremations were handled by Hess.
Earlier this year, a Reuters report highlighted Hess’s unusual twin business of running a funeral home and a body brokerage -- a company that takes the donated dead, dismembers them and sells their body parts, typically to educators and researchers. 
In the wake of the report, federal agents raided the facility, and state regulators ordered Sunset Mesa, the funeral home, to shut down. 
In Colorado and most other states, operating a body broker firm is legal. But running such a business from the same facility that houses a funeral home and crematory is highly unusual. Reuters found no other operation active in America that housed a funeral home, crematory and body broker in the same place and run by the same owner.
In the order shutting down the facility indefinitely, Colorado regulators found that Hess failed to maintain required cremation records for at least five years and final disposition records of the deceased for at least seven years. Sunset Mesa also disposed of bodies before obtaining the required permits, according to the state order. 
The order also cited concerns about a case involving the ashes Hess returned to one family. Hess sent the family what she said were the cremated remains of the body. But the order said the remains were analyzed by the family and found to be concrete. 
Since the shutdown, Hess has not responded to emails from Reuters seeking comment, and Sunset Mesa’s web site was taken down. The attorney who was once speaking on her behalf was unavailable when Reuters visited the law office, a receptionist said. The lawyer, Carol Viner, also did not respond to written questions.
The FBI has been so overwhelmed by calls about Hess that it set up a hot line and email address (sunsetmesa@fbi.gov) for people with information or concerns. It’s now distributing a questionnaire titled “Seeking Victim Information in Sunset Mesa Funeral Directors Investigation.” Late last month, the agency also released a statement saying it would be testing some ashes. 
“It’s tearing families apart,” said Laurie Gowen, 56, a longtime worker at a local grocery store. Her husband co-owned the funeral home before Hess. “The whole community is really in a bad way over this whole thing because she ran a lot of bodies through there,” Gowen said.
The scope of the Hess operation remains unclear. A Reuters review of death notices found Sunset Mesa handled arrangements for at least 128 people in 2017, 85 in 2016 and 59 in 2015. 
Donor Services shipped at least 26 boxes containing bodies or body parts from the funeral home in 2016, according to partial shipping records the news agency saw. Some of those shipments were headed to Saudi Arabia, according to Melissa Hardee, co-owner of Retriever Freight, the company that handled shipments for Donor Services. Hardee said she intended to contact the FBI.
Shirley Hollenback said she grew suspicious when she went to the funeral home to collect her husband’s ashes. She said workers told her they couldn’t find them and that Hess was in Hawaii.
Five days later, Hollenback said, Hess drove to her mobile home and gave her a black box with a white sticker labeled “G. Hollenback.” Hess, she said, told her that the cremated remains had been in a safe, which was why they could not be immediately located.
After hearing about the Hollenback case, Reuters enlisted the help of researchers at Western Carolina University to examine the ashes. The news agency paid $1,200 for the testing. The results raise questions about who is in the box. 
For example, Cactus Hollenback was wearing no jewelry — and was clad only in pajama pants and a zipperless sweatshirt — when his corpse was taken from the hospital to Sunset Mesa, Shirley Hollenback said. But researchers found what appeared to be metal fragments in the ashes. That debris could be parts of a zipper and a wristwatch burned during cremation, said two veteran funeral directors who examined pictures of the ashes.
“I have the watch” that Cactus used to wear, Shirley Hollenback said. “I checked his wrist for a pulse and he had no watch on.” 
Shirley Hollenback and her daughter filed suit against Hess Feb. 21 in Montrose County District Court. They allege that Hess sold part or all of Cactus Hollenback’s body and gave them someone else’s remains. The suit asks for unspecified damages for emotional distress, horror, grief and humiliation.
Some Sunset Mesa clients had better experiences. Marcia Schroeder said Hess handled funerals for her father in 2012 and her father-in-law a few months ago. “All I can say is, for me and my family, she was excellent,” Schroeder said. “Very personable, very honorable.”
Others are left — as a headline in the local newspaper put it last month — “NOT AT PEACE.”
Connie Logan Montano of Montrose wonders about the buried cremains of the daughter who died in 2007 and the brother who passed away in 2015. She’d like to have them dug up and tested, but her elderly father would object. 
“It would destroy him,” Montano said.
Heather Thomas, 29, of Okmulgee, Oklahoma, recalled asking Hess to let her see her father’s body before cremating it in June 2015. He died in Colorado at age 46. A family friend had asked Hess to handle arrangements for free. “We couldn’t afford it at that time,” Thomas said.
Thomas, who lived out-of-state, said Hess told her that she would not want to see the body. Thomas insisted. She said Hess agreed to delay cremation until Thomas could get to Montrose. But when Thomas arrived at Sunset Mesa two days later, she said, Hess rudely told her the body had been cremated. Hess gave her and other family members some ashes, which Thomas says she still has.

“It makes sense now that she would have done something shady,” Thomas said. “Doing all this free of charge out of the goodness of her heart? I don’t know. Even then I was a little suspicious. And now I’m just wondering: What’s the truth?”

ZEELIM MILITARY BASE, Israel (Reuters) - The Israeli military hosted U.S. Marines this week for an urban combat drill in a mock-up of a generic Middle East village, sharing know-how and signaling the allies' shared interests as their leaders close ranks on a host of regional issues. 
""We are willing to work and train together, and if God wills it, if we ever need to be side by side, then we will,"" Lieutenant-Colonel Marcus Mainz of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit told Reuters during the exercise at Israel's Zeelim base.
His troops joined Israeli special forces regiments to practise battle formation, helicopter deployment and medical evacuations in a mock-up village in the desert, complete with Arabic graffiti and a fake mosque.
The maneuvers were part of a wider, biennial joint air defense exercise known as Juniper Cobra, which this year took place amid heightened Israeli and U.S. concern over the missile arsenal of Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon. 
Mainz said his troops had learned from the Israelis' experiences in fighting Hamas guerrillas in Gaza, and had in turn shared tips from U.S. warfronts. 
""They teach them what to see when they were either in the Gaza Strip or somewhere else on the battlefield, for us in Afghanistan and Iraq, and teach that young soldier what to look for,"" he said. 
""And what happens is they start getting excited and they are talking about 'I learned this here', 'I learned that there'.""

Mukhtar Ablyazov, a former chairman of Kazakhstan's biggest bank who now lives in France, has attacked Nazarbayev via Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and other social networks, and used the same platforms to recruit supporters inside the oil-rich Central Asian nation.
A Kazakh court ruled on Tuesday that his political movement, Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan (DVK), is extremist, meaning its supporters are considered criminals, the prosecutor general's office said in a statement.
The movement says it has a membership of around 80,000, predominantly inside Kazakhstan.
Nazarbayev, who has run the former Soviet republic since 1989 and routinely wins elections with more than 90 percent of the vote, appointed Ablyazov energy minister in the 1990s, but their relations soured in the 2000s.
Kazakhstan authorities say the exiled businessman instigated and bankrolled a series of protests across the country in 2016 that forced Nazarbayev to delay an unpopular land ownership reform.
They also accuse Ablyazov, who a French court ruled against extraditing in 2016, of embezzling billions of dollars from BTA, the bank he used to run. Kazakhstan has indicated it may also press charges of murder against him.
Ablyazov, who has denied any wrongdoing, did not reply to a request for comment on Tuesday. 

DVK responded to the court ruling by urging its supporters to protect their anonymity online.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Crimes verging on genocide were being committed against the Rohingya minority in Myanmar, and those crimes bore ""the fingerprints of the Myanmar government and of the international community"", the United Nations special adviser on the prevention of genocide said on Tuesday. 
Adama Dieng spent a week in Bangladesh to assess the condition of the almost 700,000 Rohingyas who had fled across the border from Myanmar, and he said during his trip he heard ""terrifying stories.""
""Rohingya Muslims have been killed, tortured, raped, burnt alive and humiliated, solely because of who they are,"" Dieng said in a prepared statement.
""All the information I have received indicates that the intent of the perpetrators was to cleanse northern Rakhine state of their existence, possibly even to destroy the Rohingya as such, which, if proven, would constitute the crime of genocide,"" he said.
He called on the U.N.'s Security Council to ""consider different accountability options.""
Myanmar's national security adviser, Thaung Tun, last week said his government did not support such atrocities. ""It is not the policy of the government, and this we can assure you,"" he said. ""Although there are accusations, we would like to have clear evidence.""
Myanmar has not allowed U.N. investigators into the country to investigate.
Another U.N. investigator said on Monday that Myanmar had launched new military operations against the Rohingya. Heavy artillery was being used in the offensives, U.N. Special Rapporteur Yanghee Lee told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva.
Dieng also blamed an international community that ""has buried its head in the sand"" for the campaign against the Rohingya. During a press conference in Dhaka on Tuesday, he called on neighboring powers China and India to ""show not only political or economic leadership"" but also ""moral leadership.""

""The world,"" he said in Tuesday's statement, ""needs to show that it is not ready to tolerate such barbaric acts.""

Authorities said his detention was part of an international action that resulted in the arrest of 17 people.
In a statement, the Slovak general prosecutor's office said it had detained Antonino V. on a European warrant issued by a Venice court. ""The court asked for Antonino V. to be extradited for prosecution for a drug-related offence,"" it said.
A spokeswoman for the general prosecutor's office confirmed the individual was Antonino Vadala, who had been a subject of reporting by Slovak investigative reporter Jan Kuciak before he was found shot dead at home with his fiancee in late February.
Venice chief prosecutor Bruno Cherchi said in a statement Vadala was under investigation for being part of a group dedicated to ""international drugs trafficking and money laundering"" that used apparently legal channels to import drugs from South America. 
Kuciak's murder has shaken Slovakia, prompting mass protests that are threatening to topple the government.
Police have interviewed more than 100 people as part of the investigation. Vadala was among seven detained on March 1 but later released. No one has been charged over the killings.
Kuciak had reported on fraud cases, often involving politically connected businessmen. His final article - unfinished but published posthumously - looked at Italian businessmen in Slovakia with suspected mafia links, including Vadala. 
Kuciak also reported that Vadala had past business connections with two Slovaks who later worked in Prime Minister Robert Fico's office. Both of the government workers have resigned but deny links to the murder. 

In an interview with Slovak news website Korzar on March 6, Vadala denied links to the Italian mafia or Slovak politicians. He said Kuciak mistook him for someone else with the same name but was killed before Vadala could meet with him and explain.

The ex-Soviet state has long been the focus of a struggle for influence between Russia and the West. Its relations with Moscow nosedived in 2017 due to a series of disagreements that included tit-for-tat expulsions of each other's diplomats.
Bolboceanu, who served as a lawmaker in 2001-2005 and 2010-2014, was arrested last year on suspicion of working for GRU from October 2016 to March 2017.
""He collected and handed over information of national interest, which could have been used against the interests of Moldova,"" the general prosecutor said in a statement.
It said its investigation had found that Bolboceanu's cooperation with GRU had included ""regular secret meetings, the use of special methods and equipment, the use of secret communication methods and the payment of monetary compensation for the execution of orders.""
Bolboceanu, who denies the charges, has the right to appeal the sentence, which also bans him from holding public office for four years after his release.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A decades-old exemption of ultra-Orthodox Jews from compulsory military service is a deeply divisive issue in Israel at the heart of a cabinet crisis that could lead to an early election.
A preliminary vote in parliament on a new bill that would maintain the exemption is expected on Tuesday. One faction in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's six-party coalition government has vowed to defy him and oppose the legislation.
That could cause Netanyahu's government to unravel, setting the stage for the possible dissolution of parliament and a snap election in which he would seek a new mandate to help survive corruption allegations threatening his political survival.
The exemption enjoyed by ultra-Orthodox seminary students has long caused friction in Israel, where Jewish women and men are called up for military service at the age of 18.
Army service for most lasts for two to three years and many who do not enlist perform alternative national service in the community, at schools, hospitals, and different organizations.
The ultra-Orthodox, or Haredim, say their study of the Torah is vital for the continued survival of the Jewish people and also fear that young men serving in the army would stray from the religious path.
Outside a military recruitment office in Jerusalem, 16-year-old Hananel Twito, a Haredi Jew, said his community has suggested he opt out of army service.
""I received a draft notice. For now, I still want to check. At the age of 18 I'll choose if I want to be recruited or not. For now, I've postponed because I still want to check if it's worth going or not,"" Twito said.
Last September, Israel's Supreme Court gave parliament a year to pass a new conscription bill after declaring parts of the existing exemption unconstitutional.
Many Israelis feel the exemption is simply unfair. Many Haredi men who devote themselves to religious studies do not have jobs and rely on state stipends and benefits.
""You are a part of this nation, you will take part of this burden,"" said David Cohen, a 26-year-old technician.
Haredim make up about 10 percent of Israel's population of 9 million.
Smadar Goldstein, who runs an education company in Jerusalem, said all Israelis should enlist to defend their country. ""They should go into the army, why shouldn't they? There's no reason any more. I'm a religious Jew as well; my son is going into the army next year,"" she said.

The action is the first major labor dispute under President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who replaced Robert Mugabe in November and whose biggest challenge is fixing Zimbabwe's economy ruined by decades of severe mismanagement. 
Cash shortages mean banks are forced to limit withdrawals, unemployment remains above 80 percent and the government still struggles to pay workers on time which prompted frequent public sector strike actions under Mugabe. 
""The main issue we have raised currently is that it does not make sense for us to continue working in hospitals that do not have any drugs or sufficient equipment,"" said Mxolisi Ngwenya, spokesman for the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association (ZHDA), which represents more than 1,000 members. 
Junior doctors in Harare went on strike on March 1. As of Monday the labor action had spread to include all public hospitals in the country, Ngwenya said.
The government had not, as agreed four years ago, increased on-call allowances for doctors to $10 an hour from the current $1.50, and has failed to fulfill other promises for better compensation and working conditions, Ngwenya said.
Junior doctors, who earn a basic monthly salary of $329 before allowances, according to Ngwenya, were yet to get duty-free vehicles as agreed previously.
In neighboring South Africa, which attracts the most skilled labor from Zimbabwe, including health workers, junior doctors on internship earned the equivalent of $2,834 last year, according to Business Day newspaper. 
Health Minister David Parirenyatwa said the government was resolving some of the grievances by the doctors and urged them to return to work while waiting for the outcome of a meeting scheduled for Thursday morning.
In the past, the government has deployed army medics to work at major public hospitals when junior doctors went on strike.
At Parirenyatwa, the largest public hospital in the capital, Reuters witnessed hospital staff turning away some patients.
A nurse who only identified herself as Eunice said they were overwhelmed without the junior doctors. Most senior doctors run private practices.
""I was told to go to a (council) clinic because they don't consider my condition an emergency,"" said Langton Sithole, 39, who said he fractured his arm when he fell from a bicycle.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain came under fire over freedom of expression on Tuesday, when the European Court of Human Rights rejected its conviction of two separatists for burning a photo of the former king, while Amnesty International said the country was ""outlawing political satire.""
The ECHR ruled that Spain's courts had breached the right to free expression of two pro-independence supporters from Catalonia when it convicted them for insulting the crown by burning a photo in 2007 of then-King Juan Carlos.
Separately, human rights group Amnesty issued a report saying a Spanish law aimed at banning the ""glorification of terrorism"" was being used as part of a sustained attack on the freedom of expression. 
The law has led to the arrest of rap musicians, film makers, social media users and even two puppeteers among others.
""Rapping is not a crime, tweeting a joke is not terrorism and holding a puppet show should not land you in jail,"" the author of the report, Eda Seyhan, said.
A spokeswoman for the High Court and Supreme Court declined to comment. Officials at Spain's Justice Ministry were not immediately available to comment. 
Spain's 1995 anti-terrorism law, which was expanded in 2015 after attacks by Islamist extremists in Paris to include social media, aims to stem public comments that could be construed as glorifying terrorism or humiliating victims of political violence.
According to Amnesty, the number of people arrested under the law rose to 39 in 2017 from three in 2011. Spain's courts did not immediately respond to a request to confirm the number of detentions. 
The arrests include a student who was detained last year after tweeting a joke about the assassination of Prime Minister Luis Carrero Blanco by the Basque separatist group ETA in 1973 and two puppeteers arrested in 2016 for including a sign in their show poking fun at the armed group.
The student received a suspended sentence, while the puppeteers spent five days in jail. 
Other detentions include 12 rappers from the collective La Insurgencia who last December faced sentences of more than two years each and bans from working in the public sector, a clause commonly added in such rulings, for lyrics seen glorifying the defunct armed anti-fascist group Grapo.
    The ECHR ruled that the conviction of the two pro-independence supporters under a separate law, which resulted in the pair each paying a 2,700 euro ($3,330) fine to avoid a 15-month prison sentence, breached their right to freedom of expression.
It said the gesture did not constitute either an incitement to hate or an attack on the king's person and ordered Spain to pay back the fines and 9,000 euros to cover costs and expenses.

Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House, acknowledged that British authorities have accused Russia in the attack on the former Russian double agent who passed secrets to British intelligence, but said he still needed to talk to May before rendering a judgment. 
""As soon as we get the facts straight, if we agree with them, we will condemn Russia or whoever it may be,"" Trump said. 
""It sounds to me like they believe it was Russia, and I would certainly take that finding as fact,"" he added. 
Britain has said the nerve agent used in the attack earlier this month was one developed by the Soviet Union, and that it was highly likely that Russia was to blame. 
Trump's comments were more equivocal than that of his then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who on Monday agreed with Britain's assessment and said that those behind the crime must face serious consequences. 
On Tuesday, Trump fired Tillerson after a series of public rifts over policy on North Korea, Russia and Iran, replacing his chief diplomat with loyalist CIA Director Mike Pompeo. 
May has given Russian President Vladimir Putin until midnight on Tuesday to explain how the nerve agent came to be used in the attack on Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33.

JERICHO, West Bank (Reuters) - The Israeli armored convoy rolls into the West Bank town of Jericho and comes to a halt outside a building with a Palestinian flag fluttering over it. 
At first glance, it might have looked like another incursion. But then out of the bus guarded by Israeli troops emerge Jewish pilgrims, on a visit to the ruins of a Byzantine-era synagogue entrusted to Palestinian security forces.
Such trips also play out at other Jewish heritage sites in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Palestinian and Israeli forces still carry out vestiges of cooperation that have somehow survived intact at ground level, years after the sides' leaders ended peace talks amid mutual recrimination and suspicion.
The West Bank is the cradle of Judaism, which claims more than a dozen graves and shrines that dot the hills and deserts that Israelis know by the biblical names Judea and Samaria. Under the 1993 Oslo interim peace accords, the Palestinians agreed to secure such sites for Jewish access. 
Some of the sites have become political flashpoints. The tomb of the Jewish matriarch Rachel is surrounded by a huge Israeli security wall that looms over the Palestinian town of Bethlehem and is often the target of protests. Further north, Jewish visits to the tomb of the biblical Joseph often provoke anger in the nearby Palestinian city of Nablus. 
But elsewhere, rarely making headlines, the pilgrimages continue more peacefully, a gesture to the kind of religious pluralism that the authors of the peace process envisaged even in the crazy-quilt geography of the West Bank, where Palestinian towns and Israeli settlements exist uneasily side by side.
""It is very good that there is the ability to come to these places with this coordination,"" said Shmuel Yosef, among a group of Jerusalem seminary students, and two conservatively dressed middle-aged Jewish women, whom Reuters accompanied on a recent Jericho visit. 
Asked how it felt to see Palestinian flags over Jewish heritage sites, he laughed and said: ""Somewhat unusual, but that's part of the experience.""
The visits are not without incident. The pilgrims looked briefly flustered when two Palestinian youths chased the bus, throwing stones. But such hostilities rarely escalate into full-scale clashes. 
IDEOLOGY
The Palestinian government, which exercises limited self-rule in a territory that it wants as part of a future independent state, frames the Jewish visits as part of the access it also arranges to Christian and Muslim sites.
""These are places of worship, and such archeological places must not be exploited from a religious point of view or be used for ideological purposes,"" Eyad Hamdan, director-general of the Palestinian Tourism Ministry, told Reuters.
The Jericho group's first stop was the preserved mosaic floor from the 6th-century Shalom Al-Israel (""Peace Unto Israel"") synagogue, known to Palestinians as the ""Shahwan Synagogue"", after a local family that built a two-story home encompassing the artifact.
The site was torched by Palestinians during a 2000 surge in fighting with Israel. It is now guarded around-the-clock by Palestinian police, quartered in caravans outside. Yet these are locked and vacated before the Jewish groups arrive - a precaution against any face-to-face friction. 
""Visitors, when they came, they were feeling very badly to see the Arabs with their guns so close to us,"" explained Erna Kobus, a tour guide who oversees the weekly Jericho pilgrimages.
""So it is good today that there is separation and we can't see them when we come in. It's not that they don't work together,"" she told Reuters.
After a prayer session, the group trundled to the other side of Jericho, to view the fenced-off mosaic floor from the 5th-century Naaran synagogue. 
One of the Jewish women on the trip, Orit Gayis, said of the

Jericho visit: ""It's very fascinating to go back to see the Bible come to life ... We were here for thousands of years, and it's very emotional and very exciting.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. general on Tuesday signaled support for the Iran nuclear deal, saying the agreement, which President Donald Trump has threatened to withdraw from, has played an important role in addressing Iran's nuclear program.
""The JCPOA addresses one of the principle threats that we deal with from Iran, so if the JCPOA goes away then we will have to have another way to deal with their nuclear weapons program,"" said U.S. Army General Joseph Votel. JCPOA, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, is the formal name of the accord with Iran agreed in July 2015 in Vienna. 
Trump has threatened to withdraw the United States from the accord between Tehran and six world powers unless Congress and European allies help “fix” it with a follow-up pact. Trump does not like the deal’s limited duration, among other things.
Votel is head of the U.S. military’s Central Command, which is responsible for the Middle East and central Asia, including Iran. He was speaking to a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the same day that Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson after a series of public rifts over policy, including Iran.
Tillerson had joined Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in pressing a skeptical Trump to stick with the agreement with Iran.
""There would be some concern (in the region), I think, about how we intended to address that particular threat if it was not being addressed through the JCPOA... Right now, I think it is in our interest"" to stay in the deal, Votel said. 
When a lawmaker asked whether he agreed with Mattis and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford's position on the deal, Votel said: ""Yes, I share their position.""
Mattis said late last year that the United States should consider staying in the Iran nuclear deal unless it was proven that Tehran was not complying or that the agreement was not in the U.S. national interest.
A collapse of the Iran nuclear deal would be a “great loss”, the U.N. atomic watchdog's chief warned Trump recently, giving a wide-ranging defense of the accord.

Iran has stayed within the deal’s restrictions since Trump took office but has fired diplomatic warning shots at Washington in recent weeks. It said on Monday that it could rapidly enrich uranium to a higher degree of purity if the deal collapsed.

Britain gave President Vladimir Putin until midnight on Tuesday to explain how a nerve agent developed by the Soviet Union was used to strike down a former Russian double agent who passed secrets to British intelligence.
Russia says it had nothing to do with the attack and will ignore the ultimatum until London hands over samples of the nerve agent used and begins to comply with its obligations under the Chemical Weapon Convention, which foresees joint investigations of such incidents.
""Any threats to take 'sanctions' against Russia will not be left without a response,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement. ""The British side should understand that.""

1276,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 10:01AM ET</span>",Ireland refers extradition case to ECJ over Polish law changes,"By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) - An Irish High Court judge has referred a Polish extradition case to Europe's top court over concerns that recent judicial reforms have been ""so immense"" that the rule of law in Poland has been systematically damaged.
The referral was made after Artur Celmer, arrested last May on the basis of a European Arrest Warrant, objected to his surrender on drug trafficking charges, saying the reforms in his native Poland undermined the possibility of him having a fair trial.
Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has pushed to assume more control of the courts since taking power in 2015 in a standoff with the European Union's executive, which launched an unprecedented action last December by calling on other member states to prepare to sanction Warsaw if it did not change tack.
The European Commission said the overhaul of courts that gives the PiS-controlled parliament de facto control over the selection of judges put the independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers in Poland at serious risk.
In a judgment delivered in court on Monday, Judge Aileen Donnelly said the Commission's findings were, by any measure, a shocking indictment of the status of the rule of law in a European country in the second decade of the 21st Century.
""This Court concludes, based upon the information before it, that the rule of law in Poland has been systematically damaged by the cumulative impact of all the legislative changes that have taken place over the last two years,"" Judge Donnelly said.
""Respect for the rule of law is essential for mutual trust in the operation of the European arrest warrant.""
""The changes to the system are so immense that I am also satisfied that cherry-picking individual changes in the legislation is neither necessary nor helpful because it is the impact of the cumulative changes on the rule of law that is particularly concerning,"" she added.
She said it was necessary for the High Court to request a ruling from the European Court of Justice before making a final determination on the extradition case.
The highly popular PiS government, which rejects accusations of undemocratic behavior and has defended the reforms as being necessary because the courts are slow, inefficient and steeped in a communist era-mentality, said it regretted that an Irish court had delayed the punishment of a dangerous criminal.
""It is incomprehensible that general, abstract deliberations, projections and speculations become the basis of such an important decision as the handover of a criminal sought in the whole of Europe,"" Deputy Justice Minister Marcin Warchol was quoted as saying on Tuesday by state agency PAP.
Warchol added that he hoped the decision would be overturned and that the decision was the result of the Irish court not understanding the reforms that are taking place in Poland.

1277,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Stability still elusive as Egypt's Sisi poised for second term,"CAIRO (Reuters) - The attack by Islamic State came as Egypt's defense and interior ministers walked toward a helicopter waiting to fly them out of the Sinai peninsula last December. Five army and police sources told Reuters that the militants fired a laser-guided missile at the aircraft, destroying it.
The ministers survived the Al-Arish air base attack, whose sophistication and boldness served as a reminder that President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, expected to easily win re-election this month, is still engaged in a major military campaign to deliver the security he has promised to Egyptians. 
Even with widespread public support, Sisi's security forces have yet to quash a stubborn insurgency in Sinai, an area that Islamic State is using as a base in its campaign to install an Islamic caliphate in Egypt. The United Nations singled out Islamic State in Egypt in a January report from its secretary general, expressing concern over the branch’s “resilience.”
The military mentioned the attack in a brief statement the day it happened but did not give details. A military spokesman, who also speaks on behalf of the defense ministry, later declined further comment on the attack. The Interior Ministry did not respond to telephone calls or reply to questions on Whatsapp about the helicopter attack.
The military previously has said that it has killed more than 1,800 jihadists in the area since late 2014, according to a Reuters review of its public statements over the period. 
Last month, the army launched a highly publicized offensive, and says it has killed scores of suspected fighters and detained hundreds more in Sinai, the main stronghold of Islamic State after their defeat in Libya, Iraq and Syria.
The military says the new campaign features unprecedented coordination between the army, navy and air force in Sinai, and that these tactics should help it clear the peninsula of militants.
Sisi's supporters argue that the security situation now, although not completely secure, is better and more predictable than the unrest that rocked Egypt for years after the Arab Spring uprising of 2011. Sisi's office did not respond to requests for comment about the security situation. 
But years of military action in the Sinai have not stopped Islamist fighters launching attacks intended to destabilize the government and stir up unrest. In the past four months, they have carried out two spectacular assaults there - on the air base on Dec. 19, and at a mosque on Nov. 24, killing more than 300 people.
In the helicopter operation, military and police sources say jihadists commandeered a house on the edge of the air base on the day of the attack and used a Russian-made Kornet missile, a much more advanced weapon than the rifles, suicide vests and mines the militants mostly use.
It was a rare and close targeting of senior government officials by Islamists, and the attack alarmed Egypt's security establishment, several foreign diplomats said.
""BRUTE FORCE""
The attack came three weeks after Sisi ordered his generals to use ""brute force"" against jihadists.
Egypt's military is using warplanes, tanks and troops that have battled radical Islamists in the Sinai for years.
Some diplomats and analysts say the army must adopt more effective counterinsurgency tactics and avoid alienating residents with the more destructive methods of air raids, curfews and buffer zones that have razed populated areas and radicalized residents.
""We're seeing the exact same military operation (as before) - aerial and ground force bombardment, mobilization of heavy armored vehicles on the ground,"" said Mohannad Sabry, an Egyptian author and researcher on security in Sinai.
A Western diplomat said Egyptian authorities have been focusing their military strategy on conventional warfare by using heavy weapons rather than adopting more targeted, intelligence-led tactics to eradicate extremism.
Military spokesman Colonel Tamer al-Rifai told Reuters that security forces were closing in on militants and blocking off their supply and escape routes.
""While one part (of the military) is searching houses, another is raiding terrorist hideouts in populated or unpopulated areas ... the operation won't end"" until militants are rooted out, Rifai said.
He said in a recent televised message that civilians would be financially compensated for material damage resulting from fighting, and that there were hundreds of development projects taking place in Sinai, without elaborating.
More than a dozen soldiers have died in the operation, the army says, adding to hundreds in recent years. Islamic State says via its online media outlets it has killed dozens of soldiers in the last month, including through the extensive use of roadside bombs.
Islamic State filmed the air base attack in a video released online showing a guided missile destroying a stationary helicopter. Reuters could not independently verify the video's authenticity.
BLINDFOLDED
Farmer Mohamed Sweilam told Reuters Islamic State fighters took over his house near the base on the day of the attack. Five army and police sources say that is where the militants launched the missile from.
""A car with armed men wearing balaclavas and some in military fatigues pulled up. At first I thought they were police,"" Sweilam, 36, said.
""They blindfolded me, drove me somewhere for several hours, then took me back. I didn't know what had happened until the next day when police came to search the house and question me (about the attack).""
Sinai Governor Abdel Fattah Harhoum announced after the attack a plan to create a secure perimeter extending west and east of the airport. 

Some residents were skeptical.
""They (authorities) think this will protect the airport, but they're wrong. It will just make people angry,"" said Mostafa Sayed, 51, whose home is also in the zone slated for clearance.
Harhoum said people forced from their homes would receive compensation.

The evacuation of the al-Qadam neighborhood, reported by the Hezbollah-controlled Military Media, was yet another step in the government's campaign to eliminate all opposition-held areas near the capital.
The area is not connected to eastern Ghouta, the main rebel enclave near the capital, which has been subject to a fierce assault by pro-Syrian government forces for nearly a month. Rebels there have so far rejected a similar evacuation offer. 
Military Media said buses had transported around 300 fighters from the Ajnad al-Sham group and their families from al-Qadam to Idlib province, a rebel-held area in the north, fulfilling a prior agreement between the army and the militants.
The transfer follows a pattern employed across Syria, under which the government and its Russian allies have laid siege to territory, launched air and ground assaults and provided safe passage out to rebel fighters who agree to withdraw.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said hundreds of fighters had left on buses over the past 24 hours. 
Al-Qadam is surrounded by government-held territory on one side and Islamic State controlled neighborhoods on the other.
The Britain-based Observatory said there was fighting between Syrian government forces and Islamic State fighters in that area, with air strikes launched against IS.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - More than 2,000 Ethiopians have crossed into Kenya seeking refuge, the Kenyan Red Cross Society said, after several civilians were killed in what the Ethiopian military said was a botched security operation targeting militants.
Addis Ababa announced on Sunday that soldiers had been deployed to the Moyale area in Oromiya, a region that shares a border with Kenya, in pursuit of Oromo Liberation Front fighters who had crossed into the country from Kenya.
But faulty intelligence led soldiers to launch an attack that killed nine civilians and injured 12 others, the state-run Ethiopian News Agency said.
""The Kenyan Red Cross Society has received at least 2,000 Ethiopian asylum seekers in Moyale Town following their displacement from Ethiopia,"" the aid organization said in a statement late Monday.
The Oromo Liberation Front is a secessionist group which the government has branded as terrorist. 
The Oromiya province has been plagued by outbreaks of violence even though Ethiopia declared a six-month, nationwide state of emergency last month.
The Kenyan Red Cross said refugees from Ethiopia had begun to arrive in Kenya on March 10, the majority being women and children. 
A state official in the Oromiya region told Reuters on condition of anonymity that tens of thousands of people have also been internally displaced.
The mayor of the Ethiopian town of Moyale was not immediately available to give details.
Ethiopia has said that five soldiers who took part in the attack have been ""disarmed"" and are under investigation, while a high-level military delegation has been dispatched to the area to launch an inquiry.
Addis Ababa imposed a state of emergency a day after Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn announced his resignation in what he said was a bid to smooth the way for reforms.
His successor as premier and chairperson of the ruling EPRDF coalition is expected to be named before the end of this month.

VATICAN CITY, (Reuters) - Pope Francis's predecessor has rejected the ""stupid prejudice"" of conservatives who say the Argentinian is destroying the Church with liberal theology, in a strongly worded letter issued on the eve of Tuesday's fifth anniversary of his election.
Five years after former Pope Benedict resigned, some traditionalists say he is still their pope, and they lambast Francis for being too lenient on divorced Catholics and homosexuals and too defensive of migrants.
""I applaud this initiative that seeks to oppose and react to the stupid prejudice according to which Pope Francis is only a practical man devoid of specific theological or philosophical formation, while I was only a theoretician of theology who understood little of the concrete life of a Christian today,"" Benedict wrote in a letter read at the presentation of volumes on the theology of Pope Francis.
Benedict, 90, has lived in near-isolation in the Vatican since he became the first pope in 600 years to resign and he rarely makes public statements. 
Many conservatives have given the 81-year-old Francis a failing grade in his first five years, saying his policies have sown confusion and accentuated a feeling of crisis.
""This is a very elegant but clear way of Benedict distancing himself from those who exploit him in their battle against Francis,"" said Father Antonio Spadaro, a Jesuit close to the pope who has written several books on him.
""Benedict is saying 'I won't allow you to do this in my name',"" Spadaro told Reuters.
Conservatives say that in his attempt to make the Church more inclusive and less condemning, the pope is weakening attention to moral issues while focusing on social problems such as climate change, economic inequality and migration.
In 2016, four cardinals issued a rare public challenge to the pope over some of his teachings on the family, particularly the possibility of letting Catholics who have divorced and remarried in civil ceremonies receive communion. The pope did not respond, and one of the cardinals has threatened to ""correct"" him publicly.
Last year, several dozen conservative Catholic academics and lay people issued a 25-page letter accusing Francis of heresy.
One problem most conservatives and liberals alike believe Francis has failed to stem is sexual abuse, which has rocked the church for decades - and since well before the current pope's election.
Francis has been under fire for initially defending a Chilean bishop accused of covering up abuse and then days later doing an about-face, sending an investigator to look into the allegations.
In his letter, former Pope Benedict disputed suggestions by conservatives that Francis' academic qualities were lacking, praising his successor as a ""man of deep philosophical and theological formation"" and praising an ""interior continuity between the two pontificates"".

But the conservative blog Rorate Caeli, which is highly critical of Francis, tweeted on Tuesday: ""The only continuity is that both are baptised men.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A makeshift memorial made up of 7,000 pairs of shoes took shape on the lawn of the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, as gun control activists dramatized the number of children killed in the United States by gunfire since the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre.
The shoe demonstration comes a day before a massive nationwide walkout by students to demand tougher laws on gun ownership, part of a campaign that emerged after the killing of 17 students and staff at a Florida high school a month ago. 
""This is really about putting the human cost of refusing to pass gun control at the doorstep of lawmakers,"" said Emma Ruby-Sachs, deputy director of Avaaz, a U.S.-based civic organization that planned the shoe memorial. The Capitol is the home of the U.S. Congress.
Activists and volunteers gathered at dawn, placing 7,000 colorful pairs of donated children's footwear side by side in a trapezoid shape to commemorate those who have died since the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. 
Dozens of people were seen standing in front of the shoes, holding large, black signs with the words ""#NOTONEMORE"" and ""7000 KIDS KILLED"" written on them.
Donors to the shoe monument include actresses Susan Sarandon and Bette Midler, and talk show host Chelsea Handler.
Wednesday's #ENOUGH National School Walkout, organized by the activists who helped plan the Women's March in Washington for the past two years, will begin at 10 a.m. local time (1400 GMT).
Students across the country will walk out of their classrooms for 17 minutes to commemorate the 17 victims who lost their lives in the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. 
The massacre was the deadliest school shooting since 20 children and six adults were shot dead at Sandy Hook more than five years ago.
About 1,300 people below the age of 18 are killed by gunfire in the United States every year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The walkout has won the support of many school districts and civil rights organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union. More than 2,500 walkouts are scheduled across the country, according to the organizer's website. 
Some schools will allow students to participate and have encouraged them to exercise their free speech rights under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A few have threatened to suspend students if they disrupt class by leaving. 
""When students protest at schools, our school staff will respond appropriately and allow our students to be heard,"" said Robert Runcie, superintendent for public schools for Broward County, Florida, where Parkland's Marjory Stoneman is located. 
Dozens of colleges and universities across the country, including at least three Ivy League schools, have said their application processes will not consider disciplinary action taken against high school students who engage in protests.
Tuesday's shoe memorial is reminiscent of a monument on the Danube River near the Hungarian Parliament in Budapest commemorating thousands of people, including Jews, killed by fascists in the 1940s. 

Many Canadian cities have marked the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women on Dec. 6 with similar ""shoe memorials.""

Europe's relations with Erdogan have been fraught in recent years but the EU depends on Turkey to keep a tight lid on immigration from the Middle East, where the war in Syria has killed hundreds of thousands and pushed millions from homes.
Top EU officials will meet Erdogan on March 26 in the Bulgarian city of Varna despite misgivings among many on the European side. 
The bloc's top migration official Dimitris Avramopoulos will announce on Wednesday that the European Commission proposes the extra funding on projects benefiting Syrian refugees in Turkey, the sources told Reuters.
Turkey has accepted 3.5 million refugees from Syria, and the EU is already spending a first 3 billion euro installment to help them.
Over a million more refugees and migrants reached the EU in 2015, most of them flowing through Turkey. Brussels agreed to pay to help host migrants on the Turkish soil in exchange for Ankara preventing more from trying to cross the Aegean to Greece. 
This reduced the numbers to a trickle and this cooperation with a key NATO ally has muted EU action against Turkey over a crackdown on critics, dissenters and civil society following a failed coup in 2016. Erdogan has also attacked EU members Germany and the Netherlands in his speeches.
The bloc has mainly responded by freezing some funding that Turkey had been eligible for as a candidate for EU entry and suspending accession talks that have long been stalled anyway. 

The EU will also release in April what the sources said would be a ""critical"" report on Turkey's accession bid.

PATRAS, Greece (Reuters) - The migrants bolted across a street and clambered over a fence into the Greek port at Patras, scouting around for trucks to stow away in.
Dozens at a time scaled a 2-km stretch of fence one afternoon last week, playing cat-and-mouse with police officers who pushed them back only for the men to try again hours later.
They are part of a growing number of migrants in Greece trying daily to smuggle themselves onto ferries at Patras to get to Italy. It's a dangerous passage but it has become more appealing since the closure in 2016 of the overland Balkan route to northern Europe.
A few hundred, mostly young Afghan or Pakistani men, squatted in abandoned factories facing the port and showered in water that ran yellow from rusty pipes.
At night, with fewer officers on patrol, a Reuters team witnessed groups breaking into locks to get into trucks or crawling under tarpaulins.
""Get down! Get down from there!"" an officer with the coast guard's special forces squad yelled at a man peering at him from the undercarriage of a truck lined up for embarkation control, who was then handcuffed and escorted away.
Authorities arrested 760 people hiding in trucks or carrying forged travel documents at Patras in January and February, close to a third of the total of 2,627 arrests in 2017, according to official data. In 2016, 1,040 people were arrested.
Those arrested are held at most overnight before they are released, and many try their luck again the following day.
Images from an X-ray van showed hideouts not visible to the naked eye: two men were discovered lying on their backs in a fuel tank. Another crouched beneath watermelons.
The route from Patras, one of two ports linking Greece to Italy, is not new but when Europe's refugee crisis began in 2015 and nearly a million people landed in Greece on boats, taking the overland road to countries like Germany was a safer option.
When those borders closed in March 2016 and a European Union deal with Turkey stranded over 50,000 refugees and migrants in Greece, Patras started buzzing again, said Dimitris Kyriakoulopoulos, a coast guard captain overlooking the port.
""What we're dealing with here is a gradual increase in the number of these people,"" he said.
Anger is simmering among truck drivers, who sometimes chase migrants away with sticks, fearing arrest if a stowaway is found among their freight. 
One driver, who gave his name as Harry, climbed into his truck to find three migrants hiding among stacks of aluminum last Thursday night.
""It's awful. It doesn't get more awful than this and no one takes responsibility,"" he said. 
No one can say how many migrants make it across. Italian authorities returned 147 people to Greece last year, up from 112 in 2016 and 44 in January and February, according to Greek data.
Italy's Interior Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. 
Across the port in the squat, migrants spoke of their friends who made it to Italy and said they, too, would keep at it despite the risks.

""Everything is dangerous,"" said Arshad Wardak, 24, from Afghanistan. ""You have to go through all the suffering to get into a better place. So this is why everybody is trying.""

""I am doing a whole series of assessments to see if it is the right moment for me to be a candidate, and much of the data indicates that it is,"" he said in a radio interview.
Meirelles said his research is sounding out what Brazilians are looking for in the next president they will elect in the Oct. 7 general election.
He has to decide by April 7 whether to resign as minister to run for president. That is also the deadline for joining the ruling Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB) party, which could nominate him instead of President Michel Temer.
Both Temer and Meirelles received about 1 percent of voter intentions in a recent Datafolha poll. But the MDB is set on having its own presidential candidate and Meirelles is gaining strength as the better option, party officials say.
Asked whether being part of Temer's unpopular government would hurt his chances, Meirelles said Brazilians were beginning to give it credit for recovering the economy for deep recession.
""The great majority of voters are looking for a candidate who will continue the reforms and modernization of the economy, who is focused on recovering jobs, income, quality in education, better labor relations and public security,"" he said.

Meirelles has given a flurry of radio and television interviews this year as he considered running for president.

The March 4 vote ended in political gridlock, with Salvini, a tough critic of EU-imposed budget austerity and Italy's migrant inflow, jockeying for power with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which emerged as the single largest party. 
Neither group has enough seats to govern alone, leaving the country's president with the delicate task of persuading rivals on the fractured political scene to team up and run the country. 
The League surpassed the Forza Italia (FI) of Silvio Berlusconi in the elections, weakening the former premier's claim to temper his partners' more radical ideas, especially regarding Brussels and the single currency.
""Last Sunday's vote shows that the emperor wears no clothes,"" Salvini told reporters at the European Parliament. ""European policies have robbed us of the right to a future and to hope.""
He said that if he succeeds in heading a government he would prioritize renegotiating treaties including on budget restrictions, banking and trade.
Salvini harked back to the continent's shared government before the Maastricht Treaty that introduced the euro.
""The European Community was one thing, it was a community of equals,"" Salvini said. ""The European Union cancels, destroys. We are the rebuilders of the real European dream. I think the destroyers are the people sitting in the European Commission at the moment."" 
Before losing the top spot, Berlusconi had promised a center-right government would respect Europe's limit on a country's deficit relative to its economic output, but Salvini said there should be no unconditional promise to do so. 
The three percent deficit limit ""is one of those rules, written around a table, which we are happy to respect if they help people live better, but if in the name of those constraints we have to fire, close and destabilize, no."" 

During the election campaign, all of Italy's political parties responded to rising dissatisfaction with the EU by promising to renegotiate treaties, but the League was the only large party to say explicitly it only wanted to remain within the EU if fiscal and immigration rules were re-written.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African President Cyril Ramaphosa was dealt a political blow on Tuesday, after a last-minute legal challenge by a group loyal to ousted leader Jacob Zuma blocked the signing of $4.7 billion in renewable energy deals. 
The North Gauteng High Court agreed to hold a full hearing on the matter on March 27 after the National Union of Metalworkers (NUMSA) and Transform RSA, a group which has lobbied for Zuma in the past, on Monday argued the deals would lead to coal-sector job losses.
State power utility Eskom was due to sign 27 mostly wind power and solar deals with independent power producers (IPPs), in the first major investment deal since Ramaphosa replaced Zuma last month.
""We are confident that the court will recognize that our rights have been violated,"" NUMSA said. 
Transform RSA did not answer calls for comment.
DELAYS UNDER ZUMA
The projects were delayed for two years under Zuma as he pursued a much-criticized $100 billion nuclear power plan.
Ramaphosa, a wealthy businessman, has made revamping the economy a top priority. But many investors are concerned about his ability to push through reforms given deep divisions in the ruling African National Congress (ANC).
Zuma reluctantly resigned last month under sustained pressure from sections of the ANC but his allies remain in high-level roles in the party and are opposed to Ramaphosa.
""Given our history, it is natural that you suspect ulterior political motives in the court application,"" said Dominic Wills, a director at Sola Future Energy, one of the energy companies involved in the deals. 
The energy ministry said in a statement that it decided not to sign the contracts until after the court ruling and reaffirmed its commitment to expanding green energy programs.
Investors remained positive.
""I'm still fairly optimistic these deals will be signed. When you look at the cold, hard facts about our economy, these are the sort of deals that need to be done,"" Wills said.
'WAVE OF CHANGE'
NUMSA argues that a switch to renewable energy would increase electricity costs for poor South Africans.
Energy analyst Chris Yelland, however, said the cost of renewable energy has fallen significantly and it is now cheaper than new coal and nuclear projects.
South Africa relies on coal-fired plants for more than 80 percent of its electricity generation while renewables contribute around 7 percent. Eskom is one of the world's largest producers of greenhouse gases.
""Ultimately this application is futile and economic sense will prevail. South Africa must transform from a dirty energy economy to a cleaner energy economy,"" Yelland said.
South Africa's renewable power program was the fastest-growing in the world seven years ago, attracting $15 billion of investment into wind farms and solar projects involving a cluster of new IPPs backed by foreign investment.
Over the past two years Eskom stopped signing renewable energy contracts and focused instead on a plan to build a fleet of nuclear power plants, in a deal that some members of the ANC and rights groups said would be open to corruption.

Eskom's former board is being investigated by parliament over allegations it siphoned off state funds to companies controlled by the Gupta family, businessmen friends of Zuma. Zuma and the Guptas deny any wrongdoing.

1293,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",Slovak PM under pressure to agree early election as coalition unravels,"BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico was under pressure on Tuesday to agree to an early election after a junior party looked set to abandon his three-party coalition government following mass protests against corruption and the murder of a journalist.
The Most-Hid (Bridge) party, a centrist group representing the ethnic Hungarian minority in Slovakia, said on Monday it would seek a deal with coalition partners about leading the country toward a snap election and would leave the government if no agreement was made.
Slovakia was thrown into crisis after the murder in late February of a journalist investigating corruption. Last week saw the largest street protests since the end of communism nearly three decades ago as anger grows over graft and organizers have promised new demonstrations for Friday.
Mid-way through a third term, Fico is facing calls to quit, a blow to the long-time leader who has sought to stand out from largely euroskeptic leaders in central Europe by pushing the country of 5.4 million closer to the European Union's core.
He was due to respond to Most-Hid's demands on Tuesday.
Fico's other coalition partner, the Slovak National Party (SNS), which has moved from the far-right towards the center in recent years, said on Tuesday it would only talk with partners about an early election if the government falls or the coalition falls apart. ""Any speculation about fixing an election date is premature,"" it said.
An early election looked more likely now, political analyst Aneta Vilagi said, although a minority government of Fico's Smer and SNS was possible, with the support of independent lawmakers or the far-right People's Party-Our Slovakia party.
""Smer may still win the early election despite the loss of some voters but Fico's aggressive communication weakens its coalition potential,"" she said.
Fico has led the country for 10 of the last 12 years. His coalition with Most-Hid and SNS since the 2016 election holds a majority of 78 seats in the 150-member parliament. 
Opposition parties, hoping for an early election, have filed a no-confidence motion against Fico's government. The vote is set for next Monday and they need 76 votes to topple it.

Most-Hid said on Monday it was too early to say how the party would vote on such a motion.

1295,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 08:57AM ET</span>",Japan cautious while South Korea upbeat after North Korea talks in Tokyo,"By Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - Differences between Japan and South Korea on how to handle North Korea emerged on Tuesday with South Korea upbeat on prospects but a more cautious Japan demanding that North Korea account for Japanese people it says North Korea abducted decades ago.
Signs of easing tension with North Korea began during the Winter Olympics last month, when the North sent a high-level delegation to the South for the Games, after more than a year of rising alarm over the North's nuclear weapon and missile tests.
Japan has been more guarded about the prospect of talks between the two Koreas, and between North Korea and the United States. Japan has warned that ""talks for the sake of talks"" would be unacceptable.
South Korean officials have been briefing neighbours and allies, including Japan, on a South Korean delegation's visit to North Korea last week, which included talks with leader Kim Jong Un and agreements on summits with both South Korea and the United States. 
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday met South Korean National Intelligence Service chief Suh Hoon. Suh, a member of the South Korean team that visited North Korea, held talks on Monday with Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs Taro Kono.
Abe told Suh that Japan wanted any denuclearization talks with North Korea to also address a dispute over the abductions of Japanese citizens by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s. He also said North Korea had to show its willingness to disarm.
""A resolution of the abduction, nuclear and missile issues is Japan's core policy,"" Abe said. 
""North Korea must match its words with actions.""
A Japanese government source later said Japan was considering seeking a summit between Abe and North Korea's Kim to discuss the abductions.
Abe has made the abductions a keystone of his political career and has said he would not rest until all 13 of the people North Korea admitted to kidnapping have returned and the isolated state divulges information about the others Japan suspects were taken to train North Korean spies.
North Korea allowed five people it abducted to return to Japan.
Abe's insistence that the abductions be included in any North Korean talks may be a source of friction with South Korea.
Reflecting that possibility, South Korea's presidential office made no mention of Abe's call on the abduction issue in a statement after his talks with Suh.
The South's presidential Blue House said Abe told Suh he did not believe North Korea would use the summits to buy time to pursue its nuclear and missile programmes. 
A Japanese foreign ministry spokesman declined to say whether Abe had made the remark but said it was unusual for South Korea to be making statements on Japan's behalf.
'EARLY STAGE'
Similarly, on Monday, the Blue House cited Japanese Foreign Minister Kono as saying the progress with North Korea was a ""miracle"".
In Japan, Kono made no mention of a miracle but said Japan and South Korea had agreed to maintain ""maximum pressure"" on North Korea until it takes ""concrete action"".
Suh was due back in Seoul on Tuesday, while South Korea's National Security Office chief, Chung Eui-yong, who led the delegation to Pyongyang, is holding talks in Russia following talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing on Monday.
The Chinese leader told Chung China looked forward to an important opportunity for talks.
Trump has agreed to meet North Korea's Kim by the end of May. South Korean President Moon Jae-in plans to hold his summit with Kim by the end of April.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, speaking on Monday in Nigeria, said preparations for Trump's meeting, including determining the location and agenda, were still at a ""very early stage."" 
Washington had still to hear directly from Pyongyang, he added.
The White House said it fully expected the meeting to take place, if North Korea stuck to its promises. 

Abe, who asked Trump for help to resolve the abduction issue in a telephone call after the planned talks were announced, said he aims to meet Trump in the United States next month.

1296,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 06:50AM ET</span>",Malaysia's Mahathir says he can win a fair election but expects it to be 'terribly dirty',"By Praveen Menon
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad on Tuesday said his opposition alliance could easily win a general election that must be held by August, so long as it was free and fair, but that he expected it to be ""terribly dirty"".
At 92, Malaysia's old political war horse has another shot at the top job, and a win against scandal-tainted Prime Minister Najib Razak would make him the world's oldest premier.
It would also bring to an end the 61-year rule of a party that Mahathir helped build, and which has held power since Malaysia's independence from Britain in 1957.
""We have a good chance of winning this time because public opinion is very much for us,"" Mahathir told Reuters in an interview at his office in the administrative capital, Putrajaya. 
""The only way Najib can frustrate us is by cheating. If it's a free and fair election, we will win hands down.""
Mahathir was a tough establishment stalwart for decades, the scourge of dissenters who dared to challenge the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO).
But a scandal over a state-run investment fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), has brought unprecedented shifts in Malaysia's political forces, and Mahathir now heads an opposition alliance and is seen as the biggest threat to Najib, who has been engulfed in the scandal.
Najib denies any wrongdoing over 1MDB, which is at the center of money-laundering investigations in at least six countries, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore.
Despite the scandal, analysts and ruling party sources say Najib is confident of election victory, and could hold the polls as early as April. 
The opposition alliance is concerned, in particular, about plans to redraw the boundaries of more than half of Malaysia's 222 parliamentary constituencies. Critics say the moves are unconstitutional and could skew voting in favor of Najib.
""It's going to be a terribly dirty election,"" Mahathir said, adding that he suspected Najib might derail his plans to stand.
""I believe that one way or another he is going to make sure that I cannot contest,"" Mahathir said, pointing out that the government had delayed the registration of his party, which could affect his campaign. 
Asked for examples of dirty tricks, Mahathir said his party had found instances of more than 70 people registered as voters from one house and several hundred people with suspiciously similar names on the voter roll.
The ruling party fared surprisingly poorly in the last general election in 2013. The opposition, which won the popular vote last time, said the ruling party only sealed victory through fraud.
The government rejected that complaint and dismisses fears of rigging this time. Reuters was not able to verify any opposition allegations of fraud.
'PREPARING EXCUSES'
Mahathir said a swing by just 10 percent to 20 percent of UMNO's rural, ethnic Malay, Muslim voters would be enough for the opposition to achieve a majority.
He said he thought the opposition could win more than 111 seats, or more than half the seats in parliament.
""It's not optimistic .... with all these scandals, I think generally people are very much against Najib,"" he said, referring to 1MDB.
The opposition camp won 88 seats in the last election, but that included seats won by the conservative Islamic party Parti Islam Se-Malaysia, which has since left the opposition camp.
A spokesman for the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, dominated by the UMNO, dismissed Mahathir's chances.
""Mahathir Mohamad knows he is going to lose,"" the spokesman said in a statement, adding that Malaysians could not accept a 92-year-old former dictator.
""Mahathir is preparing excuses for the defeat of his ageing alliance of former enemies, many of whom he jailed and who are temporarily working with him now, only out of desperation,"" he added, referring to Mahathir's warnings of rigging attempts.
Last year, Mahathir joined hands with Malaysia's most popular opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, whom he sacked from the role of deputy prime minister in 1998. Anwar was jailed the following year on charges of corruption and sodomy that he says were politically motivated. 
Mahathir has promised to seek a royal pardon for Anwar if he wins the election and has said he would then step aside and let Anwar be prime minister.
""It's not easy for him to agree to my role in the opposition party. It would be his role, except he is in prison,"" he said.
Mahathir said he aimed to keep up his fight against UMNO even if he loses this time. 

""I will be in my late 90s and physically not as strong. But if I am well enough, I will continue the struggle.""

Israel's government loses ""billions of shekels in revenue every year"" because of under-the-table cash transactions, the Tax Authority said on Tuesday.
The World Bank in 2010 said Israel's so-called shadow economy was equal to 22 percent of economic output. Israel produced about $366 billion in 2017, which would mean the economy loses out some $80 billion.
The new law imposes a limit of 11,000 shekels ($3,197) on cash transactions made to businesses, which could be further reduced by the finance minister 6,000 shekels in 2020. Cash deals between private individuals, such as buying a used car, will be limited to 50,000 shekels, a level that may be lowered to 15,000 shekels.
Violators will receive warnings until the law goes into full effect in 2019, the Tax Authority said.
The law also states that checks will be limited to 10,000 shekels. Tourists will be limited to paying no more than 55,000 shekels to buy services or assets, although they can do so up to five times.

Reuters this week reported that China was considering paring back the summits, which have fed concern in Western capitals that Beijing is seeking to divide the continent, citing three European diplomats.
The diplomats said there were indications China could delay the next ""16+1"" summit, scheduled for the Bulgarian capital Sofia later this year, and hold future meetings every two years, instead of on an annual basis.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a daily news briefing he was aware of the report, but had not heard the events might be pared back or postponed.
""China attaches great importance to this, and we are in close touch and communication with all sides on preparatory work for the meeting,"" he added, without elaborating.
""With the hard work of all sides, China-Eastern Europe cooperation over the last five or more years has maintained a good development momentum, and has made great achievements."" 
Besides boosting cooperation between China and Eastern Europe, the summits played a positive role in promoting European integration and balanced development in Europe, Lu said.
The swift development of this cooperation could not have come without the impetus and guidance from the leaders' meetings, Lu said, adding that last year's summit agreed on Bulgaria as the site for this year's event.

Minutes after the blast, Hamdallah, appearing unhurt, delivered a speech at the inauguration of a waste treatment plant in the Gaza Strip, live TV footage showed. He said in the address that three cars were damaged.
The Authority said it held the enclave's dominant Hamas group responsible for the attack, stopping short of directly accusing the group of carrying out the assault, but suggesting it had failed to provide adequate security. 
Gaza's Hamas-run interior ministry said the explosion hit as the prime minister's convoy passed near the northern town of Beit Hanoun. No one was injured and security services had begun an investigation, ministry spokesman Eyad Al-Bozom said.
The prime minister is based in the occupied West Bank and traveled overland, via Israel, to the Gaza Strip. Police said the explosion came shortly after Hamdallah's convoy passed by, and one witness said it appeared two cars at the end of motorcade sustained damage.

The six Boeing (NYSE:BA) Insitu ScanEagle drones, which have two cameras and can operate for up to 24 hours on a single run, were financed through a $13.7 million grant from Washington's foreign military assistance program.
It follows the transfer of two single-engine surveillance planes last year.
The Philippines plans to deploy the drones for surveillance against militants and pirates, and for surveying the aftermath of disasters like typhoons, mudslides and earthquakes.
""This acquisition of ScanEagle is one way to modernize the military to deter those who want to wage war against our country,"" Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said at a ceremony at a Manila air force base, attended by the U.S. ambassador.
""This collaboration is also an indication of the Philippines and the United States' goodwill, deep friendship and genuine commitment to peace.""
The United States is the most important military partner of the Philippines, with a decades-old treaty alliance and numerous pacts that enable rotational deployment of U.S. troops and annual joint exercises.
However, ties have been tested by President Rodrigo Duterte's hostility towards the United States.

Nevertheless, the U.S. military provided technical support and surveillance vital in helping the Philippines end a five-month occupation of Marawi City by pro-Islamic State rebels last year.

1310,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>",Putin has Russia guessing before election: how long will he keep power?,"By Christian Lowe and Olesya Astakhova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Soon after Vladimir Putin is re-elected on Sunday, his thoughts will turn to the question that is likely to dominate his next term as Russia's president: what will he do when it ends? 
Putin's victory in the presidential election is not in doubt as his ratings are high and he has the state machinery behind him, but how long the man who has dominated Russia for nearly 18 years wants to stay power is uncertain.
The constitution limits the president to two successive terms, obliging him to step down at the end of his mandate -- as he did in 2008 after serving two four-year terms. 
His mandate will not expire until 2024 but the problem needs immediate attention because the uncertainty about his long-term future is a source of instability in a fractious ruling elite that only he can keep in check.
""The Russian political scene is entering a new phase,"" said Gleb Pavlovsky, a former Kremlin adviser who is now critical of the country's leadership. ""Most discussion within the ruling elite focuses not on the next stage of the Putin era but on what will constitute the post-Putin era.""
Vygaudas Usackas, the European Union's ambassador to Russia until last October, says the stakes are high. 
""This is a risky moment for the system,"" said Usackas, who is now director of the Institute of Europe at Lithuania's Kaunas University of Technology. 
Putin has at least three main options. He could take a leaf out of Chinese President Xi Jinping's book and seek an end to term limits, hand over to a place-holder for a term and then return, or anoint a successor and bow out of public life.
Each choice carries risks and Putin may have other options up his sleeve. A former spy, he is secretive and likes to pull surprises. But the uncertainty about his plans is potentially more destabilizing than anything for the ruling elite, the political, security and business leaders around Putin.
Two sources close to the Kremlin said there was, as yet, no plan for when Putin's terms ends. The matter is so sensitive that they agreed to talk only on condition of anonymity. 
Russia's ruling system, while projecting an image of unity, is divided along many lines -- between security hawks and economic liberals, between people with personal vendettas, and between competing business interests. 
Putin holds the disparate interests together, so any hint of a vacuum at the center of the system is risky.
PUTIN FOREVER
Putin is so entrenched within Russia's ruling system that many of its members can imagine no other leader. Many in state companies and major banks say they anticipate no real change at the top when Putin's next term ends. 
""There are no discussions in the corridors about the succession. It's as if people know that he (Putin) will be around forever,"" said a source in a government ministry.
If Putin want the constitution changed to allow a third successive term, he will need two-thirds support in the lower house of parliament, three-quarters in the upper chamber and approval in two-thirds of regional legislatures. 
All are institutions where Kremlin allies are the overwhelming majority but Putin has said will not change the constitution to stay in power. 
If he did so, he would risk a backlash from voters who might see it as Russia turning its back on democracy. He also avoided the temptation to tinker with the constitution to extend his rule in 2008, when he last faced term limits. 
Instead, he stepped aside and let a loyal lieutenant, Dmitry Medvedev, run for president, certain he would win with the Kremlin's backing. Putin, who became prime minister for four years, secure re-election when Medvedev's term ended in 2012, and Medvedev has been prime minister since then.
Putin controlled the country from the wings between 2008 and 2012, and might see a similar move as an option now. Medvedev's ratings are much lower than Putin's but the ruling elite could accept him as a tried-and-tested proxy for Putin.
""Only Medvedev,"" a source in government circles told Reuters when asked who could be president after Putin. ""Everyone is afraid of change.""
FATIGUE
Age, though, might now get in the way for Putin. 
He is in robust physical shape but will be 71 when his fourth term ends. If he again stepped aside for a full term, he would be 77 on his return -- the presidential term was extended to six years in 2008 during Medvedev's presidency.
One of the sources close to the Kremlin said Putin does sometimes feel extremely tired, but largely through exasperation at officials' incompetence and bureaucratic sloth.
During a meeting with Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko in 2016, Putin was caught on an open microphone confiding to his ally: ""I don't get enough sleep. The day before yesterday I slept for four hours, last night I got five hours.""
Putin might also be loath to rule in his late seventies as he has portrayed himself as a healthy and energetic leader since replacing the ailing Boris Yeltsin and providing the vitality lacked by most leaders in the dying days of the Soviet Union.
He will soon have ruled longer than Soviet Communist leader Leonid Brezhnev, whose 18-year rule from 1964 to 1982 is primarily associated with stagnation, though dictator Josef Stalin ruled the Soviet Union for three decades.
To enjoy a restful retirement, Putin would need to anoint a fully fledged successor who can hold on to power in his or her own right and also protect the interests of the ruling elite.
Kremlin insiders say Putin has selected no heir apparent, and that any names being circulated are the product of speculation, not knowledge of Putin's thinking. 
The names include Igor Sechin, head of state oil firm Rosneft; Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu; Igor Dyumin, a former Putin bodyguard who became a regional governor, and Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin.
Anointing a successor also entails dangers for Putin as doing so too soon would risk him becoming a lame duck, allegiances shifting from him to the heir apparent and new turf wars being set off in the ruling elite. 
Above all, Putin will want to ensure any successor can hold on to power, will protect him and will not dismantle the system built around him.
Handing over to an heir, while eventually inevitable, will therefore also be Putin's riskiest path.

""The longer he stays in power, the harder it will be to exit,"" said Andrei Kolesnikov, senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, a think tank. ""How can he abandon such a complicated system, which is essentially his personal project?""

Turkey launched its operation, dubbed ""Olive Branch"", in northern Syria nearly two months ago to sweep the Syrian Kurdish YPG from the Turkish border. Turkey sees the YPG as a terrorist group and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
The forces encircled Afrin town and also captured ""areas of critical importance"" in the region as of Monday, the Turkish military said in a statement.
On Monday, a Turkish government spokesman said the armed forces had gained control of more than half the area and vowed to clear the Afrin town of militants. 
President Tayyip Erdogan last week said Turkish forces had besieged the Afrin town and were nearing its town center, but a YPG spokesman later denied this, saying the regions claimed to be under Turkish control were still battlegrounds.
Since the start of its offensive, Turkey has also threatened to push its military operations to Manbij, further east, to sweep Syrian Kurdish fighters from the length of its borders.

Turkey's repeated threats to push to Manbij have caused complications with NATO ally the United States, which has its troops deployed in the area and is backing the YPG in the fight against Islamic State, a move that has infuriated Ankara.

1312,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 10:28AM ET</span>",Britain gives Putin until midnight to explain nerve attack on former spy,"By Guy Faulconbridge and Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain gave President Vladimir Putin until midnight on Tuesday to explain how a nerve agent developed by the Soviet Union was used to strike down a former Russian double agent who passed secrets to British intelligence.
Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, have been in hospital in a critical condition since March 4 when they were found unconscious on a bench outside a shopping center in the English cathedral city of Salisbury.
Prime Minister Theresa May said it was ""highly likely"" that Russia was to blame after Britain identified the substance as part of the highly-lethal Novichok group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet military in the 1970s and 1980s.
""Either this was a direct act by the Russian state against our country,"" May told parliament on Monday. ""Or the Russian government lost control of this potentially catastrophically damaging nerve agent and allowed it to get into the hands of others.""
Russia holds a presidential election on March 18 in which Putin, himself a former KGB spy, is expected to coast to a fourth term in the Kremlin. It has denied any role in the poisoning and says Britain is whipping up anti-Russian hysteria.
Russian ambassador Alexander Yakovenko, summoned to the Foreign Office, was given until the end of Tuesday to explain what happened or face what May said were ""much more extensive"" measures against the $1.5 trillion Russian economy.
If no satisfactory Russian response is received by midnight London time then May will outline Britain's response in parliament. She was due to hold a meeting of top security officials on Wednesday. 
Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said that the British response would be ""commensurate but robust"".
U.S. President Donald Trump, who on Tuesday ousted Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State, said that it sounded as if Russia was to blame. Trump said he would take the British conclusions about Russia's involvement as fact.
Russia has requested access to the nerve agent used against Skripal but Britain has rejected this, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. Britain's ambassador to Russia met Lavrov's deputy in Moscow on Tuesday, an embassy spokesman said.
JOINT WESTERN RESPONSE
Britain could call on allies for a coordinated Western response, freeze the assets of Russian business leaders and officials, expel diplomats, launch targeted cyber attacks and cut back participation in events such as the soccer World Cup.
While trade figures show that Russia accounts for less than 1 percent of British imports, London is of major importance for Russian companies seeking to raise capital and is the Western capital of choice for many Russian business leaders.
The European Union said that the attempted murder of Skripal was ""shocking"" and that it was ready to support Britain if asked to do so. France and Germany condemned the attack and offered support to Britain.
""We stand with the UK in pursuit of justice in this case and are ready to offer support if necessary,"" a spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said.
Huge amounts of Russian money have poured into the British capital since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, causing some to refer to it as ""Londongrad"".
James Sherr, a Russia expert at the Chatham House think-tank, told Reuters Britain could hurt Putin and his allies by denying them access to the City of London's financial services. 
""They have milked and taken for granted its services as a hub for their global dealings and investments. They have been accustomed for a long time to regard this country as their playground and we have the means to change that,"" he said.
""This regime in Russia is founded on a tight and unprincipled merger at all levels between power and money: if you attack the money, you are also attacking the regime's power.""
The EU has travel restrictions and asset freezes against 150 people and 38 companies, a response to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. EU nationals and companies are also banned from buying or selling new bonds or equity in some state-owned Russian banks and major Russian energy companies.
NERVE AGENT
May said Russia had shown a pattern of aggression including the annexation of Crimea and the murder of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, who died in 2006 after drinking green tea laced with radioactive polonium-210. 
A public inquiry found the killing of Litvinenko had probably been approved by Putin and carried out by two Russians, one of them a former KGB bodyguard who became a member of the Russian parliament. Both denied responsibility, as did Moscow.
British Home Secretary Amber Rudd said police and the MI5 spy agency would look into allegations of Russian state involvement in 14 other deaths in Britain in recent years.
Britain's ambassador to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said Russia had failed to declare its full stockpile of nerve agents to the international body.
Peter Wilson told reporters that Russia, which says it destroyed all its chemical weapons under OPCW supervision last year, has in fact ""failed for many years"" to fully disclose its chemical weapons program.
Skripal betrayed dozens of Russian agents to British intelligence before his arrest in Moscow in 2004. He was imprisoned in 2006 but in 2010 he was given refuge in Britain after being exchanged for Russian spies. 
He had lived modestly in Salisbury since then and kept out of the spotlight until he was found unconscious on Sunday.

A British policeman who was one of the first to attend to the stricken spy was also affected by the nerve agent. He is now conscious in a serious but stable condition.

1313,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 03:59AM ET</span>",Australia to stress international law in South China Sea dispute,"By Colin Packham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop will on Tuesday hail the role of international law in settling regional conflicts, comments apparently aimed at bolstering Australian efforts to build a coalition against Chinese assertiveness.
Bishop, in a speech ahead of a special meeting of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Sydney, will not name China but will argue that international law will stabilize a region strained by rival claims in the South China Sea.
""The rules-based order is designed to regulate behavior and rivalries of and between states, and ensure countries compete fairly and in a way that does not threaten others or destabilizes their region or the world,"" Bishop will say in Sydney, according to a leaked draft of the speech seen by the Australian Financial Review.
""It places limitations on the extent to which countries use their economic or military power to impose unfair agreements on less powerful nations.""
China claims most of the South China Sea, an important trade route which is believed to contain large quantities of oil and natural gas, and has been building artificial islands on reefs, some with ports and air strips.
Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, all of which are members of ASEAN, and Taiwan also have claims in the sea.
Australia, a staunch U.S. ally with no claim to the South China Sea, has long maintained its neutrality on the dispute to protect economic relationship with China.
But with Australia's relations with China souring in recent months, Bishop's comment underscore a new Australian tactic. [nL3N1O83M7]
""Australia is trying to get ASEAN on side with the notion that China is a rule-breaker that everyone would be better served by abiding by,"" said Nick Bisley, professor of international relations at Melbourne’s La Trobe University.
""If it can get ASEAN to use that language, it will strengthen Australia's position considerably.""
ASEAN and China in August begun talks to develop a code of conduct for the South China Sea, though a deal is unlikely before 2019, Singapore's Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen said in February. [nL4N1PX1D2]
The issue of the South China Sea is set to dominate the unofficial agenda of a special three-day meeting of ASEAN countries and Australia beginning on Friday.
Officially, the summit will focus on fostering closer economic ties among the 10 members ASEAN and Australia, and countering the threat of Islamist militants returning to the region from the Middle East.

Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi is expected to travel to Sydney where she will hold bilateral talks with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who is under pressure to publicly condemn the deaths and expulsion of thousands of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar's Rakhine State over recent months.

They said several other people were wounded in the blast, which witnesses said was caused by a car laden with explosives, apparently driven by a suicide bomber, towards the kitchen in al-Derain area in northern Aden.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack and officials could not be reached for comment.
It was the second attack of its kind targeting security forces in the city, where UAE forces from the Saudi-led coalition that has been operating in Yemen since 2015 hold sway.
Islamic State last month claimed responsibility for an attack targeting the headquarters of a counter-terrorism unit in Aden that killed at least 14 people, including the attackers.
Witnesses said rescuers were trying to pull out four charred bodies clearly visible in the destroyed kitchen. The force of the blast damaged stores and cars nearby.
The Saudi-led coalition joined the Yemen conflict in March 2015 after the armed Iran-aligned Houthi group pushed towards Aden, forcing the internationally-recognized President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile in Saudi Arabia.
Last month, UAE-backed southern Yemeni forces wrested control of Aden from forces loyal to Hadi in several days of fighting that ended with a truce brokered by Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

After parliament's Deputy Speaker Aysenur Bahcekapili announced the voting result, a brawl erupted between nationalist lawmakers and those from the main opposition. Several parliamentarians traded punches and shoved and chased each other in the chamber.
The legislation formally allows for the creation of electoral alliances, paving the way for a tie-up between President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party and their nationalist allies. It was widely expected to pass, given the combined support of the AKP and the nationalist MHP.
But government critics have sounded alarm over the law.
It grants the High Electoral Board the authority to merge electoral districts and move ballot boxes to other districts. Ballots will be admissible without the stamp of the local electoral board, formalizing a decision made during a referendum last year that caused a widespread outcry among government critics and concern from election monitors. 
Under the law, security force members will be allowed into polling stations when invited by a voter, a measure the government says will stamp out intimidation by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in the mainly Kurdish southeast.
Opposition lawmakers, including from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), have said the presence of security forces at polling stations could be used to make vote counting less transparent.

The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party has said the measures could lead to ballot boxes being moved out of districts where it has strong support.

1316,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 05:41AM ET</span>",Sick and injured begin to leave besieged Syrian enclave in Ghouta,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Sick and injured civilians were shown on Syrian state television leaving a besieged rebel enclave in eastern Ghouta on Tuesday in what insurgents and the United Nations said was a medical evacuation. 
Women carrying small children, men hobbling on crutches and an old man in a wheelchair were shown walking among a group of Syrian soldiers near the al-Wafideen crossing point out of the enclave. 
The army's near month-old campaign of air and artillery strikes in the last big rebel bastion near the capital has killed more than 1,100 civilians, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says. 
Syrian government forces have captured more than half of eastern Ghouta, a pocket of satellite towns and densely populated farmland where the United Nations says 400,000 civilians have lived under siege since 2013. Advances in recent days have cut off the major towns Douma and Harasta from each other and neighboring areas, splitting eastern Ghouta into separate enclaves. 
Yasser Delwan, a political official with the Jaish al-Islam rebel faction, said the people who left Douma were the first of several batches of patients expected to be evacuated for treatment outside. 
The group had said on Monday it had reached an agreement, through the United Nations, with the government's key ally, Russia, to evacuate wounded people.
The government assault on eastern Ghouta has become one of the biggest offensives of the war now entering its eighth year, and is on course to deal the rebels their biggest defeat since the battle of Aleppo in 2016.
Russia has offered rebels safe passage out with their families if they surrender the territory, a tactic Damascus and Moscow have used elsewhere across Syria as they have recaptured more and more of the country since 2015.
The two main Ghouta factions have so far vowed to stay and fight.
Tuesday's evacuation was the first deal agreed by rebels with Russia and Damascus to allow civilians out since the start of the government offensive. 
But Hamza Birqdar, Jaish al-Islam's military spokesman, said in a video message online on Tuesday that the fighters would continue to defend the Ghouta till the end.
The United Nations has called for the urgent evacuation of 1,000 patients in need of emergency medical care. It says it is worried about the entire population of the eastern Ghouta, where food and medicine were already running out before the assault began in mid-February.
With the area now split into different parts by the army advance, Delwan said his rebel faction was in charge only of evacuations from Douma, and not from other towns.
State television said the first group comprised about 35 people and they would go to a shelter on the outskirts of the nearby Syrian capital Damascus. 
Families are sleeping in the open in the streets in Douma with no more room in basements to shelter from the bombs, local authorities have said. 

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said government bombardment continued early on Tuesday in the southern part of the enclave, which includes the towns of Saqba, Kafr Batna and Jisreen.

1317,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 02:53AM ET</span>",U.S. picking up Taliban interest in Afghan peace talks: Mattis,"By Phil Stewart
KABUL (Reuters) - The United States is picking up signs of interest from Taliban elements in exploring the possibility of talks with Kabul to end the more than 16-year-old war, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday as he made an unannounced visit to Afghanistan.
""There is interest that we've picked up from the Taliban side,"" Mattis told reporters before landing in Kabul, saying the signs dated back several months.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani offered talks without preconditions with the Taliban insurgents last month, in what was seen by U.S. officials as a major overture from Kabul.
Mattis said some of his indications, which he did not detail, dated back before Ghani's remarks.
""We've had some groups of Taliban - small groups - who have either started to come over or expressed an interest in talking,"" Mattis said.
""In other words, it may not be that the whole Taliban comes over in one fell swoop. That may be a bridge too far to expect. But there are elements of the Taliban clearly interested in talking to the Afghan government,"" he said.
The United States has in the past also expressed hope of ""peeling off"" elements of the Taliban and it was unclear how this new effort might be different.
Western diplomats and officials in Kabul say contacts involving intermediaries have been underway with the aim of agreeing on ground rules and potential areas of discussion for possible talks with at least some elements in the Taliban.
However, the insurgents, who seized a district center in western Afghanistan earlier this week, have given no public sign of accepting Ghani's offer, instead issuing several statements suggesting they intended to keep fighting.
TALIBAN CONTROL
The United States has stepped up assistance to the Afghan military and greatly increased air strikes against the Taliban as part of its new regional strategy announced last year, in a bid to break the stalemate and force the insurgents to the negotiating table.
Mattis said the goal was to convince the Taliban insurgents that they could not win, which would hopefully push them towards reconciliation.
However, Taliban fighters control large parts of the country, the Kabul government itself is deeply divided and thousands of Afghan soldiers and civilians are killed every year.
Uzbekistan is set to host an Afghan peace conference later this month, where participants are expected to call for direct talks between the militant group and Ghani's government.
However, the Taliban appears likely to miss that conference and have so far ruled out direct talks with the Western-backed government in Kabul, which they say is an illegitimate, foreign-imposed regime.
They have offered to talk directly to the United States about a possible peace agreement.
Asked whether the United States would be willing to talk directly with the Taliban, Mattis reiterated the U.S. position that the talks should be led by Kabul.
""We want the Afghans to lead and provide the substance to the reconciliation effort,"" Mattis said.
While the United States has been stepping up battlefield pressure, Afghanistan's international partners have sought to build diplomatic support from neighboring countries to push the militants to the negotiating table.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has also piled pressure on Pakistan to crack down on militant safe havens on its side of the Afghan-Pakistan border. Mattis said he had seen some positive indications from Islamabad, noting some Pakistani military operations along the border.
Outlining his goals for the trip, Mattis said he wanted to get an assessment of both the re-tooled U.S. war effort as well as the reconciliation efforts.

Reconciliation, Mattis said, was ""almost an equal priority of my interest going in.""

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Investigators have retrieved the flight data recorder from the wreckage of a Bangladeshi airliner that crashed, killing at least 49 aboard, including the crew, when it attempted to land in Nepal's capital, officials said on Tuesday.
The airline and airport authorities in Kathmandu have blamed each other in the aftermath of Monday's aviation disaster, the Himalayan nation's worst since the 1992 crash of a Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) aircraft killed 167.
""The flight data recorder has been recovered, we have kept it safely,"" said Raj Kumar Chettri, the airport's general manager, adding that an investigation had begun into the cause of the crash.
The Bombardier Q400 series aircraft was carrying 71 people from the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka when it tried to land in conditions of visibility that weather officials said exceeded 6 km (4 miles), with clouds at one end of the runway and a light tailwind of six to seven knots.
Flight operator US-Bangla Airlines said Captain Abid Sultan, a former pilot of the Bangladesh Air Force, had landed more than 100 times at Kathmandu, where wind shear and bird hits are frequent hazards.
Sultan had more than 5,000 hours of flying experience and was specially trained to land at the airport, said airline spokesman Kamrul Islam.
The airline also denied a media report that the aircraft had skidded off the runway during a domestic flight in 2015, saying it ""never ever encountered any accident. It had no technical glitches.""
CONFUSION ABOUT RUNWAY 
Defending the pilots, airline chief executive Imran Asif cited a transcript of their radio conversation with ground control in Kathmandu that was issued by a German air safety website, JACDEC.
""We suspect wrong signals from Kathmandu air traffic control room might have led to the crash,"" Asif told reporters on Monday. ""A three-minute conversation between the pilot and the air traffic control before the landing indicated that they sent a wrong signal to the pilot.""
The transcript, which Asif said was accessible on YouTube, reveals confusion over the runway designated for the flight to land.
Transmissions by the Kathmandu tower controller show that, despite being cleared to land on runway 02, the flight began deviating from its course. 
The captain and the tower controller discussed which runway the aircraft was aiming for, the website said. At one point, the controller told the woman copilot she was heading toward runway 20, although the aircraft had been cleared for runway 02. 
Later, the captain took over the conversation and confirmed the plan to land at runway 02. At one stage, ground control said runway 20 had also been cleared for landing, however. 
Eventually the plane made an attempt to land on the runway it was originally meant to use, but crashed short of it, broke into pieces and caught fire. Both pilots are dead.
Sanjiv Gautam, a senior Nepali civil aviation official, did not directly confirm the authenticity of the transcript, saying instead that publication of such exchanges went against the law.
""We don't know how it got out,"" said Gautam, the director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. ""It's illegal for such conversations to be made public."" 
On Tuesday, airport operations had returned to normal, while the wreckage of the crashed aircraft lay on a piece of ground near the runway, guarded by security personnel, Reuters video images showed. 
A US-Bangla plane took off for Kathmandu from Dhaka on Tuesday, carrying seven airline officials and 46 relatives of the passengers. 
""Regardless of what contributed to this tragic accident, we are sorry,"" Asif, the airline's chief executive, wrote on networking website LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD). ""And we stand by the bereaved families of those who lost their loved ones.""
On Monday, Kathmandu airport officials said they had asked the pilots if they faced a problem after the aircraft changed course in the final descent, but the pilots said they were not.
The plane was then seen circling twice in a northeast direction, Chettri said. Traffic controllers again asked the pilot if things were OK, and he replied, ""Yes"".
The tower then told the pilot his alignment was not correct, but received no reply, Chettri added.
Canadian plane maker Bombardier said it was sending an air safety investigator and a field service representative to the site.

The atrocity had plunged President Enrique Pena Nieto's government into one of its worst crises, as doubts swirled around the conduct of the investigation into the case.
The attorney general's office said it had arrested Erick N, ""a probable member of a criminal organization"" operating in the violent southwestern state of Guerrero.
The government had put a 1.5 million pesos ($81,000) bounty on Erick N.'s head because of his alleged involvement in the murder of the student teachers, who went missing in September 2014.
An initial investigation had found that the victims were abducted by corrupt police who handed them over to members of a local drug cartel, who then killed them, incinerated their bodies at a trash dump and threw the ashes into a river.
However, the official account has been widely questioned by local and international human rights experts. 
During his six-year-term, which will come to an end in December, the murder rate has climbed, with more than 25,000 committed across the drug-ravaged country in 2017, the highest since modern records began.
Earlier this month, the prosecutor in charge of the case said Mexican authorities were preparing to arrest dozens of people implicated in the killing of the student teachers.
Last week, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said he would soon issue a report ""on elements of the investigation"" in the case.

1320,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 09:37PM ET</span>",Germany on alert for possible attacks on Turkish sites,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German security agencies are on alert for signs of violence against Turkish facilities in Berlin, Stuttgart and other cities, the Interior Ministry said, after fires damaged several Turkish-run mosques over the weekend.
Firefighters battled for over 90 minutes to extinguish a blaze at the Koca Sinan mosque in Berlin early on Sunday. It was the latest in a series of incidents police say may be linked to demonstrations by hundreds of people against Turkey's military operation in the northern Syrian region of Afrin aimed at sweeping the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia from the Turkish border.
""The events in the region can stoke passions among Kurds living here in Germany,"" a ministry spokeswoman said, noting that conflicts between Turks and Kurds were also playing out in Germany, which is home to about 3 million people with ties to Turkey, including many ethnic Kurds.
The ministry appealed to demonstrators to avoid violence, and said protesters needed to abide by German laws.
""The security agencies are constantly exchanging information with regard to current events,"" she added.
German politicians and interest groups, including the Kurdish community, on Monday strongly condemned the attacks and messages on social media calling for further violence.
""Whoever is behind these attacks and calls for violence, whether it's circles close to the PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party insurgents in Turkey) or the Turkish intelligence agency MIT, nothing justifies this form of inhumane violence,"" Ali Ertan Toprak, head of the Kurdish community, said in a statement.
Toprak urged Kurds living in Germany to use democratic means to express their views about the Turkish offensive in Afrin.
Several people were injured in demonstrations over the weekend in Duesseldorf, with additional protests reported in Hamburg, Kiel, Saarbruecken and Kaiserslautern, according to German media reports.
Suleyman Kucuk, deputy state leader of the Turkish DITIB organization in Berlin, said the mosque in the neighborhood of Reinickendorf was heavily damaged in Sunday's blaze.
""The whole house of worship has to be renovated and rebuilt,"" he told Reuters TV. 
Police spokeswoman Valeska Jakubowski said police were investigating what she described as a serious case of arson. Investigators say the attack was likely politically motivated.
The PKK has been banned in Germany since 1993, but it remains active, with nearly 14,000 followers among the country's Kurdish immigrant population.
Turkey has repeatedly criticized Germany for not taking a more assertive stance against the PKK.

BRUSSELS/STRASBOURG, France (Reuters) - The European Parliament savaged EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday for promoting his chief aide to the top of the EU civil service, saying it smacked of cronyism and would fuel mounting public distrust.
Lawmakers from across the spectrum, including Juncker's conservatives, criticized the sudden appointment of his chief-of-staff, Martin Selmayr, to be secretary-general of the Commission, an affair that has become known in Brussels as ""Selmayrgate"". 
""Frankly, we have shot ourselves in the foot,"" Francoise Grossetete of Juncker's centre-right European People's Party said, arguing that the decision to pick Selmayr, during a closed-door meeting on Feb. 21, was ""grist to the mill"" for eurosceptics.
Selmayr, a 47-year-old German lawyer known as a hard-driving devotee of European integration, is both feared and admired by senior EU officials. In his new position he is in charge of the day-to-day running of the 33,000-strong EU civil service.
Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage said his appointment was ""the perfect stitch-up"", an example of ""nepotism"" that showed Britain was right to be quitting the European Union.
The Greens threatened to hold up approval of the Commission's budget and the Liberal group demanded Juncker reverse the appointment. 
Their leader, former Belgian premier Guy Verhofstadt, evoked the case of Juncker's compatriot Jacques Santer, whose Commission was ousted in 1999 over a nepotism scandal.
""If the Juncker Commission is not careful, it will have the same fate,"" Verhofstadt tweeted.
The European Ombudsman said it had received two complaints about Selmayr's appointment and was analyzing them. The Ombudsman has limited powers but has a record of shaming the Commission over perceived failings, such as conflicts of interest.
Juncker, a former Luxembourg premier whose five-year term ends in 18 months, has defended the appointment as one he and his 27 fellow commissioners were entitled to make. It is not subject directly to parliamentary oversight and could be overturned by Juncker's successor, who will be chosen by EU national leaders.
Several lawmakers criticized Juncker for failing to appear before parliament, sending Guenther Oettinger, the commissioner who runs personnel issues, instead.
""We have done everything by the book,"" Oettinger said, adding Selmayr was ""100 percent suitable"" and that his German nationality and political allegiance to Europe's powerbroker Chancellor Angela Merkel were of no consequence. 
""We have acted within the letter of the law,"" Oettinger said.
But several lawmakers said the spirit of transparency had been breached. 

Werner Langen, who, like Oettinger and Selmayr, is a German Christian Democrat, said the affair reminded him of ""19th-century secret bureaucracy"".

1323,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 03:50PM ET</span>",Venezuela opposition asks U.N. not to send observers to May vote,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition alliance called on the United Nations on Monday not to send observers to the presidential election on May 20 to avoid legitimizing a poll it says is rigged in favor of Socialist President Nicolas Maduro.
Maduro, who is seeking re-election amid an economic collapse that has sent a tide of migrants to neighboring countries, has asked the United Nations to send observers to the vote.
The main opposition coalition is boycotting the election on the grounds that the elections council has historically favored the ruling Socialist Party, and because the best-known candidates have been jailed or barred from holding office.
""What we have asked the United Nations today is not to validate the electoral fraud in May,"" said legislator Delsa Solorzano of the Broad Front coalition at a small demonstration outside a U.N. office in Caracas.
She added that any U.N. mission should ""be only for human rights issues, not to validate a dictatorship."" 
A U.N. spokesman contacted via email said the government's request for a mission had been received.
""But our position on all such matters is that the sending of electoral observers requires a mandate from one of the UN's Member State bodies"" such as the Security Council or General Assembly, wrote spokesman Farhan Aziz Haq.
""If the (General Assembly) or the Security Council were to provide a mandate, we would respond accordingly. But neither has done so up until now.""
Opposition leaders are planning a protest on Saturday to demand better conditions for the upcoming vote.
Former state governor Henri Falcon has broken with the coalition and will run against Maduro, insisting that Maduro's low opinion poll numbers make him a weak candidate. Critics say the government is likely to manipulate the vote results and that participating will legitimize the process.
Maduro says his government is the victim of an ""economic war"" led by the opposition with the help of Washington. His critics say the country's problems are the result of dysfunctional socialist policies.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A day after the United Nations Security Council demanded a ceasefire across Syria in February, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley - angry that Russia delayed the vote for several days and skeptical the Syrian government would comply - spoke with President Donald Trump. 
""There's a lot of decisions to be made now,"" said Haley during a visit to Central America days after the unanimous Feb. 24 Security Council vote. ""We all throw options out on the table and then the president will decide.""
On Monday, Haley told the Security Council that if the 15-member body failed to act on Syria then Washington ""remains prepared to act if we must,"" just as it did in April last year when the United States bombed a Syrian government air base it said was used to launch a deadly chemical weapons attack.
The United States is asking the council to adopt a new resolution demanding an immediate 30-day ceasefire in Damascus and rebel-held eastern Ghouta, where Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, backed by Russia and Iran, say they are targeting ""terrorist"" groups shelling the capital.
The assault on Ghouta is one of the heaviest in Syria's war. Eastern Ghouta has been besieged for years after many of its residents joined the initial protests against Assad's rule in 2011. The death toll in the seven-year-long war has passed half a million people, the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
""We have to decide what action are we going to take on everything else that's happening,"" said Haley during her Central America trip. ""Whether it's how the Syrian regime is using chlorine, and whether it's the ceasefire not being handled or the humanitarian access.""
The Syrian government has denied using chemical weapons.
It was not immediately clear when the U.S. resolution would be put to a vote. But during her Central America trip, Haley made clear she has no desire to play diplomatic games with Russia. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, France or Britain to pass.
Haley, a member of Trump's cabinet, said the council is ""so obsessed with unity and that's great and it's pretty and it's nice, but if unity doesn't accomplish anything it's not good for anybody.""
""You're making everybody happy except for the people of Syria. And those are the people we're supposed to be fighting for,"" she said. 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the council on Monday that since the adoption of the February ceasefire resolution, which was drafted by Sweden and Kuwait, ""there has been no cessation of hostilities.""
Haley, who had engagements in Chicago in the days leading up to the Feb. 24 ceasefire vote, was furious at what she described as ""Russian stalling."" Sweden and Kuwait delayed calling a vote for several days in a successful bid to win Russia's support by dampening language on when a truce would start. 
Russia has said the Security Council could not impose a ceasefire without a deal between the warring parties. 
The council is also considering a separate U.S. push for the creation of a new inquiry into who is to blame for chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Russia blocked the renewal of a previous international investigation in November.
""Syria is Russia's. They took ownership of it, they need to fix it and now they're whining because they can't,"" Haley said during her Central America trip. ""Iran is controlling Assad and Russia is their puppet covering for them at the Security Council."" 
Russia is worried that Trump is planning further military action against the Syrian government. 

""We are very much concerned that the alleged chemical use might be a pretext for something bigger and much more dangerous,"" Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told Reuters.

1326,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 09:28PM ET</span>","Police link two deadly package bombs in Austin, Texas, to earlier attack","By Jon Herskovitz
AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Two package bombs left outside homes in Austin, Texas, exploded on Monday, killing a teenager and injuring two women in attacks that police linked to a deadly blast earlier this month.
The latest bombings came as the Texas capital hosted its annual South by Southwest music, technology and film festival downtown. The victims in all three cases were African-American or Hispanic, and police said they were examining the attacks as possible hate crimes.
In each of the three attacks, a cardboard package was left at the front of a private residence and exploded after an unwitting victim picked it up or tried to open it, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley told reporters. 
The packages that exploded on Monday were not delivered by any mainstream commercial shipping services, such as Federal Express or  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS), Manley said.
""We are looking at these incidents as being related,"" Manley said, adding that federal investigators had joined the search for suspects and a possible motive.
""We cannot rule out that hate crime is at the core of this, but we are not saying that that is the cause,"" Manley told a news conference.
He warned residents to watch out for boxes left outside their homes and to report anything suspicious to police.
The first explosion, on March 2, killed a 39-year-old black man at a house in the city's Harris Ridge neighborhood, which is home to technology companies and about 12 miles (19 km) northeast of downtown. The blast was powerful enough to blow out walls at the home's entryway.
A 17-year-old African-American boy died on Monday when he found a package outside his house in east Austin and brought it into the kitchen of his home, where it exploded, Manley said. 
A woman in her 40s was in the home and injured by the blast, although she was expected to survive, police said.
A second explosion, about 4 miles (6 km) away in southeastern Austin, injured a 75-year-old woman in the predominantly working-class Hispanic community of Montopolis, police said. A neighbor, Brandon Rendon, told Reuters the victim was in a wheelchair watering her grass before the blast occurred.
Monday's attacks unfolded as the city was thronged by visitors to the South by Southwest Festival. On Monday afternoon, London Mayor Sadiq Khan delivered a keynote address at the event, which draws hundreds of thousands of people to the city each year.

Manley said the bombings posed no threat to the festival, but he urged visitors to remain vigilant.

1328,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 02:01PM ET</span>",Saudi Arabia must ban discrimination against women: U.N. rights panel,"By Stephanie Nebehay
GENEVA (Reuters) - A U.N. rights watchdog called on Saudi Arabia on Monday to end discriminatory practices against women, including its pervasive system of male guardianship, and give them full access to justice.
After reviewing the deeply conservative kingdom's record, the independent experts welcomed recent decisions to allow women to launch their own businesses and to lift a de facto ban on them driving a car, set for June.
Saudi Arabia is still one of the most restrictive countries for women in the world. It has no women ministers and retains a guardianship system requiring women to have a male relative's approval for important decisions.
In its conclusions, the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) urged the Saudi government to ""abolish practices of male guardianship"". It should enforce a recent order that would entitle all women to obtain a passport, travel or study abroad, choose their residency, and access health care ""without having to seek their guardian's consent"".
""We asked for the abolition of the system, because even though they said they had passed a law, we realized that in practice the system still continued,"" Hilary Gbedemah, a panel member, told Reuters. 
A Saudi delegation told the panel last month that it had implemented rules and laws tailored to traditions and religious values that allowed women more independence as they played a growing economic role. Laws concerning justice and child protection had been strengthened.
But the experts said that Saudi Arabia should implement a comprehensive strategy to ""eliminate patriarchal attitudes and stereotypes that discriminate against women"". 
Rape and all forms of violence against women should be made crimes under Saudi law, they said. 
Child marriages, forced marriages and the compulsory dress code for women should be ended, it said. Women should have the right to choose their dress and not face violence or threats by the religious police and their male guardian.
Discussion of the guardianship issue had been ""very wide"" with the delegation, Gbedemah said. 
""We saw it where women were deemed to be disobedient to their guardians, where they needed their consent to marry, where the guardians could enforce dress codes, and in the area of domestic violence,"" she said.
""So in a nutshell, these are the four important areas that we asked for follow-up on, within two years,"" she said.
Gbedemeh, asked about the planned lifting of the ban on driving, said: ""Even if it is symbolic, it is a positive step.
""Because for so long it was taken for granted that women could not and would not drive,"" she said. ""I am positive that once this is done, it will open the gates for leverage for removal of other restrictions"".

PARIS (Reuters) - Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's far-right National Front party, which at the weekend decided to change its name to the National Rally, plans to sue another right-wing politician who accuses her of stealing his party's name.
The legal sparring comes as Le Pen is trying to revive her movement after defeat to Emmanuel Macron in last year's presidential election, amid internal disagreements over policy and splits in the party founded by her father.
At a weekend congress, Le Pen secured the backing of members to rename the party the National Rally, a rejig she hopes might put some distance between it and the National Front's past associations with racism and anti-Semitism.
But as well as evoking the name of other far-right movements of the past - including the collaborationist Rassemblement National Populaire of World War Two - the new name was claimed by Igor Kurek, a little-known French politician who is president of a party called ""Rassemblement National"" (National Rally).
""Dear Marine, the RN (Rassemblement National) already exists and you can't deny that when it has stood against your candidates several times since 2014,"" Kurek wrote in a letter he published on Twitter.
""The RN is Gaullist and republican right, the FN is extreme right,"" he wrote, referring to the National Front. ""The FN will NEVER be the RN and the RN will NEVER be the new FN.""
Speaking on RTL radio, Le Pen dismissed Kurek's claim, saying her party first registered the name ""Rassemblement National"" in 1986. She said she would take legal action against Kurek for what she called his fraudulent use of the National Front's flame logo as his party's symbol.
TRADEMARK
In France, trademarks and logos are registered with the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI). The INPI register shows that the brand ""RN Rassemblement National"" and its logo were registered to a Frederick Bigrat in 2013.
In a statement, the National Front said it knew that and had bought the rights by private deed last month.
""This sale is in the process of being recorded by INPI, which explains why research on the prior rights of the trademark still show the name of its previous owner,"" the statement said.
A legal battle is perhaps the last thing Marine Le Pen wants. She has already had a public spat with her father, who she kicked out of the party, and has split from her chief adviser, who now heads a rival movement.
The National Front also had its accounts shut down by two banks late last year over regulatory issues.

But Kurek shows little sign of backing down. He told Europe 1 radio he planned to go to court to defend his use of the name and would field candidates in 2020 municipal elections under the Rassamblement National banner.

UNITED NATIONS/AMMAN (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley warned on Monday that Washington ""remains prepared to act if we must,"" if the U.N. Security Council fails to act on Syria, as the Syrian army's onslaught in eastern Ghouta continued unabated.
The United States asked the Security Council to demand an immediate 30-day ceasefire in Damascus and rebel-held eastern Ghouta, where Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, backed by Russia and Iran, say they are targeting ""terrorist"" groups which are shelling the capital.
The army's onslaught in eastern Ghouta, backed by air and artillery strikes, has killed about 1,160 people since Feb. 18, a war monitor said, as Assad seeks to crush the last big rebel stronghold near the capital Damascus.
""It is not the path we prefer, but it is a path we have demonstrated we will take, and we are prepared to take again,"" Haley told the 15-member Security Council. ""When the international community consistently fails to act, there are times when states are compelled to take their own action.""
The United States bombed a Syrian government air base last year over a deadly chemical weapons attack.
The Security Council demanded a 30-day ceasefire across Syria in a unanimously adopted Feb. 24 resolution.
Russia and Damascus say a ceasefire ordered by the U.N. Security Council does not protect the fighters in eastern Ghouta, arguing that they are members of banned terrorist groups.
""There has been no cessation of hostilities,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Monday. ""Violence continues in eastern Ghouta and beyond - including in Afrin, parts of Idlib and into Damascus and its suburbs.""
""No sieges have been lifted ... To our knowledge, not one critically sick or wounded person has yet been evacuated.
Russia's U.N. envoy Vassily Nebenzia also said some states were accusing the Syrian government of carrying our chemical weapons attacks in a bid to “prepare the ground for the unilateral use of force against sovereign Syria.”
“We have heard hints of that in the statements of some delegations today,” Nebenzia said. “Basically steps are being weighed which could hit regional stability very, very hard.”
HEAVY ONSLAUGHT
The assault on Ghouta is one of the heaviest in the war, which enters its eighth year this week.
Thousands of families are sleeping in the open in the streets of the biggest town in the enclave, where there is no longer any room in packed cellars to shelter from government bombardment, local authorities said. 
At least 70 people had been buried in a town park because air strikes made it unsafe to reach the cemetery on the outskirts, it said.
In a video filmed inside Douma, one man cowering in a heavily damaged shelter said: ""It is completely uninhabitable. It is not even safe to put chickens in. There is no bathroom, just one toilet, and there are 300 people.""
Douma residents said dozens of people were trapped alive under rubble, with rescuers unable to reach them due to the intensity of the raids.
Government forces have now captured more than half the rebel enclave, entirely besieging Douma and the large town of Harasta, cutting them off from each other and neighbouring areas with advances on Saturday and Sunday.
In an apparent sign of local discontent with the rebel policy of holding out, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group reported that hundreds of people protested in the town of Kafr Batna to demand a deal to end the onslaught.
Shots were fired at the crowd by unknown people and one person was killed, it said. The spokesman for Failaq al-Rahman, the main rebel group there, was not immediately available for comment.
Jaish al-Islam, one of eastern Ghouta's main rebel groups, said on Monday it had reached an agreement with the government's ally Russia to evacuate wounded people, after communicating with Moscow through the United Nations.
A U.N. humanitarian spokeswoman said the United Nations was not part of that deal and still called for the urgent evacuation of more than 1,000 sick and wounded people in eastern Ghouta.
State television broadcasts from the government-controlled side of the battlefront showed dark grey clouds of smoke billowing from several places across a landscape of shattered buildings. A minaret had lost a chunk from one side of its slender tower. In the background, heavy vehicles could be heard rumbling past and the deep crump of explosions echoed around.
HALF-MILLION DEAD
The Observatory, said on Monday the death toll in the civil war had passed half a million people.
It has confirmed the deaths of 511,000 people, it said, and has the names of more than 350,000 of them. About 85 percent were killed by government forces and their allies, it said.
Eastern Ghouta has been besieged for years after many of its residents joined the initial protests against Assad's rule in 2011 that triggered the slide into civil war. The United Nations says 400,000 people live in the enclave, already suffering shortages of food and medicine even before the massive assault began in mid-February.
Assad says the assault on eastern Ghouta is needed to end the rule of Islamist insurgents over the civilian population and to stop mortar fire on nearby Damascus.
The United Nations has warned of dire shortages of food and medicine, where international deliveries have long been erratic and often obstructed before they could reach the enclave.
The expulsion of the rebels from eastern Ghouta would represent their biggest defeat since they lost their enclave in Aleppo in December 2016. They still control large areas in the northwest and southwest and a few scattered pockets elsewhere but have been driven from most major population centres.

Syrian jets also struck rebel-held towns in the country's south, the first aerial attacks on the area since the United States and Russia brokered a deal making it a ""de-escalation zone"" last year, rebels and residents said.

Jurnal TV broadcast the conversation between Alexandru Tanase and businessman Veaceslav Platon, who is serving a jail sentence for money-laundering and fraud linked to the disappearance of $1 billion from Moldova's banking system.
In the recording, Platon asks Tanase, who was then head of the Constitutional Court, why no progress had been made with the investigation into the fraud. 
Tanase replies: ""in Moldova, as in African countries, laws are not respected."" 
In a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Monday, Tanase did not confirm or deny the authenticity of the recording, but said he would resign and called the release of the recording politically motivated.
""I have to leave, having become the target of a smear campaign,"" he said.
Multiple attempts to reach Tanase for further comment were unsuccessful.
The bank fraud saw an eighth of the impoverished former Soviet republic's gross domestic product stolen from three of its largest banks between 2012-2014.
Prime Minister Pavel Filip, who has not yet accepted Tanase's resignation, defended the minister.
""Tanase is a professional in his field. In a short space of time he has managed to achieve a lot, in particular to start judicial reforms,"" he said in a cabinet meeting.
Tanase was appointed justice minister in December 2017. The pro-Western government has been under pressure from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund to speed up reforms, whose delayed implementation held up EU loans in October.

SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Bosnia's autonomous Serb entity is ""fear-mongering"" to undermine the country's integrity by organizing nationalist paramilitary groups and disproportionately arming the region's police, a national security official said in an interview with Reuters.
Secessionist pressures in the Serb Republic, set up as one of two autonomous regions as part of a 1995 deal to end Bosnia's war among Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats, is raising international concern about a relapse into turmoil in the Balkans.
Presidential and parliamentary elections will be held at both federal and regional levels in October and Bosnian Serb authorities have already begun campaigning with steps seen as menacing to the country's fragile post-war equilibrium.
Under the 1990s peace accord meant to keep Bosnia intact, the country has been divided into autonomous Serb and Bosniak-Croat entities with a relatively weak central presidency and government based in the capital Sarajevo.
National Security Minister Dragan Mektic accused the Bosnian Serb (RS) leadership of cranking up nationalist rhetoric and sponsoring paramilitary displays to intimidate opponents and sway voters ahead of the election. 
Mektic is part of a moderate Serb bloc that is part of the Sarajevo coalition government but at odds with the RS nationalists under regional President Milorad Dodik.
""(RS) politics is verging on fear-mongering; there is an increased feeling of insecurity. All of this is making the security situation more complex,"" Mektic said.
SERB, RUSSIAN PARAMILITARIES
Concerns rose in January when a Serb far-right group, whose leaders were trained in Russia, marched in full combat gear during a parade in the Bosnian Serb regional capital Banja Luka and announced it would register as a charity there. 
Mektic also cited ""reliable"" reports that young Serbs have been undergoing military training at camps in Russia. 
Meanwhile, Russian motorcycle club Night Wolves, which is under U.S. sanctions for its role in a pro-Russian separatist insurgency in Ukraine, has announced a tour of the Serb Republic at the end of March as part of a swing through the Balkans.
Mektic said such groups were believed to have been engaged by RS authorities to help inculcate intolerance of non-Serbs or moderate Serbs ahead of the October election.
""There are efforts to manipulate elections in different ways..., lately through the organization of special groups that exert a sort of physical pressure on (certain) citizens so that they feel endangered and do not come out to vote,"" said Mektic.
""This is especially practiced by Republika Srpska authorities ... They are trying to form a para-security structure under cover of a patriotic organization to use it in a showdown with opponents."" 
He said the Night Wolves were ""no typical motorcycle club, they carry strong political messages ... The (RS) authorities want to give them legitimacy and use them in an election process,"" Mektic said, citing reports the Night Wolves planned to open an office in Banja Luka and monitor elections.
Mektic also said a recent purchase of 2,500 automatic rifles by RS police was legal but - echoing criticism from post-war international envoys in Bosnia - disproportionate compared with Bosnia's Bosniak-Croat Federation.
""They need weapons, this is not in dispute, but there is a question of proportion. It...might bring about an unnecessary accumulation of weapons which may be misused in different ways."" 

Western leaders have accused Russia, the Serbs' traditional big power ally of seeking to exploit diminishing European Union leverage in the Balkans by manipulating political events in the region. Russia denies such allegations.

Austria's parliamentary election in October was dominated by Europe's immigration crisis, when it took in some of the largest numbers of asylum seekers in the European Union, relative to its population.
Conservatives led by immigration hard-liner Sebastian Kurz won and went into government with the far-right Freedom Party.
The two sides struck a coalition deal that includes reducing the main basic welfare payment for refugees to well below the standard amounts generally available. Opponents argue that refugees should be treated equally, as they still are in some provinces, including Vienna.
The court found that people granted asylum have by definition had to flee their home countries and cannot return. 
""Those entitled to asylum cannot therefore in this context be put on the same footing as other foreigners (European Union citizens and nationals of third countries) who are free to return to their home countries,"" the court said in a statement on its ruling on Lower Austria, the province that surrounds Vienna.
The government's plans do not include capping the main benefit payment for EU citizens, which would be difficult under EU rules on freedom of movement. If refugees cannot be treated worse than EU nationals, that raises the question of whether Austria can cap refugee benefits.
The government does plan to restrict access to welfare payments for people who have lived in Austria for less than five of the past six years, as is the case in Lower Austria. 
The court struck down that five-year residency requirement and a cap on the main basic welfare payment of 1,500 euros ($1,847) per family per month, which the government plans to introduce nationally.
The residency requirement's stated objectives were to promote integration and encourage people to work. Since Austrians who have lived abroad could also fail to meet the residency requirement, the court found that it achieved neither aim, as Austrian citizens should be considered well-integrated and those who have lived abroad no less willing to work.
The government said in a statement that it respected the ruling.
""But we maintain our aim of finding a single country-wide solution that distinguishes between people who have paid into the social security system for longer and those non-Austrians who have newly arrived in the social security system,"" it said, adding that a proposal would be submitted this year.

A court handed down the four-month suspended sentence on George Germenis for attempting to cause bodily harm.
Golden Dawn, which rose from obscurity by tapping into popular anger during the country's economic crisis, tried in May 2013 to distribute food to ethnic Greeks only on a central Athens square in front of parliament. 
However, Mayor George Kaminis banned the event, calling it a ""soup kitchen of hatred"" and police scuffled with Golden Dawn supporters when they prevented the distribution.
Germenis then confronted Kaminis at a separate event elsewhere in the Greek capital when the mayor was handing out Easter presents to children.
Greek media broadcast a video of the incident. The mayor said that Germenis tried to hit him but was stopped by security men.
Germenis denied any wrongdoing, saying his intention was merely to protest against the ban on the Golden Dawn event. Legal cases often take several years to come to court in Greece. 
Κaminis, who testified against Germenis, said that Monday's ruling was a ""landmark decision"". 
In 2013, Greek police arrested Golden Dawn's leader and more than a dozen senior party members following the killing of an anti-fascist rapper by a party supporter. That trial is still ongoing. 

The party's leader has been given a suspended prison sentence for incitement of illegal activity, violence and discord.

The security forces shot dead at least 16 people, including two women and two children, out of at least 23 people known to have died during the protests, the U.N. human rights office said in a report.
""These cases raise serious concerns and may amount to extra-judicial killings,"" the report said. 
Seven people were killed by shots to the head, it said.
""Analysis of the type of injuries suffered by the victims indicate that the security forces made intentional lethal use of firearms, including beyond dissuasive or self-defense (legitimate) purposes, such as when protesters were fleeing.""
Hernandez, a conservative supported by the United States, appeared set to lose the Nov. 26 election until an abrupt halt in the vote count and a shift in the results took victory away from his center-left rival, Salvador Nasralla.
Allegations of fraud sparked protests but the result was eventually ratified by the country's electoral tribunal and both Mexico and the United States backed the incumbent.
Hernandez had pledged a hard-line strategy criticized by human rights groups to bring order to the impoverished Central American country, which has been plagued by battles between security forces, local gangs and drug traffickers.
By Jan. 27, the date of the presidential inauguration, no charges had been brought against any member of the security forces in relation to the killings, the U.N. report said.
The U.N. also said a curfew imposed as part of a state of emergency on Dec. 1 was excessive, with some 1,351 people detained within four days in mass arrests. 
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein said in a statement that things were likely to get worse unless Honduras prosecuted people for the killings. 
""The already fragile human rights situation in Honduras, which suffers from high levels of violence and insecurity, is likely to deteriorate further unless there is true accountability for human rights violations, and reforms are taken to address the deep political and social polarization in the country,"" he said.

1337,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>","Hungary seeks broader anti-migrant alliance after Austria, Italy elections","By Krisztina Than
BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary aims to coordinate more closely on refugee policy with Austria and Italy after elections there boosted anti-migrant parties, broadening an alliance of EU states focused on internal security.
Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Monday that the approach to migration of the Vienna government and the center-right in Italy was very similar to the bloc's central European member states.
""So it is obvious that we will work together in the future,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
""This is not against the western part of Europe, this is against migration, and this is in favor of our interests because we put security first.""
A bitter row over migration policy sparked by the biggest influx of refugees into the European Union since World War Two has undermined trust within the bloc and weakened its unity, with its eastern states refusing to sign up to a quota system favored by several richer members to the west and north.
In refusing to accept Muslim refugees, Hungary and its neighbors in the Visegrad group - the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia - have cited security concerns and the desire to preserve the traditional Christian make-up of their societies.
In Austria, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz formed a coalition with the Freedom Party following an election last year dominated by the issue of migration, making the country the only one in western Europe with a far-right grouping in government. 
In Italy this month, the governing center-left Democratic Party lost out to anti-establishment and right-wing parties that campaigned hard against immigration in an election that delivered a hung parliament.
'MORE EFFICIENT' COOPERATION
Szijjarto said the Visegrad countries had no plans to enlarge that alliance, but this should not prevent closer ties with like-minded states. 
""What we definitely would like to do is to have a closer and more efficient cooperation with Austria and of course hopefully with the upcoming Italian government,"" he said.
Kurz said on Friday that Austria planned to use its presidency of the European Union this year to shift the bloc's focus away from resettling refugees within the EU and towards preventing further waves of arrivals.
He also pledged closer cooperation with Hungary after meeting Prime Minister Viktor Orban at the end of January.
Orban has been one of the EU's hardliners on migration and is campaigning on a fierce anti-immigration agenda ahead of Hungary's own national election on April 8, when he will seek a third term in office. 
Asked about a recent video in which Janos Lazar, the top aide to Orban, blamed immigrants for pushing out ""white Christians"" in a district of Vienna, Szijjarto said he did not think the comments were unfortunate. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) first removed the video then reversed its decision.
""It is an open issue in Austria that the number of Muslim kids to be enrolled in Vienna schools is approaching the number of the Austrian kids to be enrolled. That is an open debate...,"" Szijjarto said.
The Social Democrats (SPO), who govern Vienna in coalition with the Greens, said Lazar's comments were part of a ""racist and xenophobic election strategy"" by Orban's Fidesz party ahead of elections.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A little-known politician beat the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) to become chairman of Pakistan's Senate on Monday, in a vote the PML-N said was a stitch up by opposition parties.
Sadiq Sanjrani, a senator from a remote part of the southwestern Baluchistan province, was a compromise candidate backed by opposition parties in a rare show of unity.
PML-N officials, who allege elements of the military are trying to weaken their party, accuse Sanjrani of being a ""pro-establishment"" candidate. Sanjrani denies being a military stooge and the army has rejected claims of meddling.
Sanjrani won 57 votes in the 104-seat chamber to beat PML-N candidate Raja Zafarul's 46, according to presiding officer Sardar Yaqoob Nasir.
""The face of this house is blackened today,"" said Mir Hasil Bizenjo, a government minister and ally of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif who was ousted by a Supreme Court ruling last July that his party suggested was influenced by the powerful military.
The military, which has ruled Pakistan for nearly half of the time since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, denies interfering in the judicial process.
""I appeal to the institutions, I appeal to the political parties that for God's sake let this country take its right course. Let this country take its democratic path,"" Bizenjo told the Senate.
PML-N displaced the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) as the single biggest one in the upper house in elections on March 3. [nL4N1QL074] But the secret ballot of members of the four provincial assemblies and the federal parliament was marred by allegations of horse trading and seat buying. 
The PPP has a long history of battling military dictatorships under the leadership of Zardari's slain wife Benazir Bhutto and her late father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and it has denied cutting a deal with the military.
The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party which joined the PPP in backing the new Senate chief, has also rejected claims of military involvement, with party leader Imran Khan tweeting that Sanjrani's election would ""strengthen the federation"".
""We are happy for the people of Balochistan & for the federation of Pakistan,"" Khan tweeted. 
In a lighter moment, all senators clapped and banged tables in appreciation when a new member, from a marginalized Hindu caste, entered the chamber.
Krishna Kumari's election was seen as a breakthrough for her Dalit community, who are the lowest rung on the caste ladder and are often referred to as the ""Untouchables"".

1342,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 11:41AM ET</span>","Givenchy, tower of French fashion and tailor to the stars, dies at 91","By Brian Love
PARIS (Reuters) - French fashion designer Hubert de Givenchy, an aristocrat who founded the house of Givenchy in the 1950s, becoming famous for dressing the likes of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Grace Kelly, has died at the age of 91, the Givenchy label said on Monday.
A commanding presence in fashion from the moment he presented his first collection in Paris at the age of 24, Givenchy became synonymous with elegance and an insouciant glamor. He designed the black dress Audrey Hepburn wore in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"".
His family -- his father was the marquis of Givenchy -- had hoped their son would become a lawyer but the young man, who stood 1.96 meters (6 feet 5 inches) tall, was drawn to fashion and design from a young age, moving to Paris to study at 17. 
His hallmark creations, including balloon-sleeved blouses and calf-length trousers with flared hems, were hailed in their time as airy alternatives to the tight waists and artificial curves of the then-dominant ""New Look"" of Christian Dior.
His first collection -- unveiled in 1952 -- won recognition the day it was presented: Givenchy rang up 7 million francs (approximately 1 million euros) of orders, enough to allow him to pay off his backers and assume ownership himself.
His interest in fabric sprang from a childhood familiarity with fine textiles at the home of his maternal grandfather, who was an administrator for the Beauvais and Gobelin tapestry industries and a collector of quality fabrics.
The designer's father died when Hubert, born in Beauvais, north of Paris, was two years old. He and his brother were brought up by their mother and her parents.
""BALENCIAGA SEES NO ONE""
The young Givenchy initially studied law but, in the atmosphere of liberation following World War Two, he entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris.
Fascinated by Spanish-born Cristobal Balenciaga, who was at that time the dean of Paris designers, Givenchy presented himself and his sketchbook at Balenciaga's door, only to be turned away with a curt ""Mr Balenciaga sees no one"".
Givenchy served apprenticeships with other designers -- Jacques Fath, Robert Piguet and the exuberant, iconoclastic Elsa Schiaparelli -- before venturing out on his own.
Of that first collection, a British fashion writer wrote: ""These dresses remind you of that first, best, glass of champagne.""
After his phenomenal debut, Givenchy went to New York to capitalize on his popularity with Americans. It was there that he finally met the reclusive Balenciaga, and the two maintained a close friendship until the Spaniard's death in 1972.
Givenchy often told interviewers: ""Balenciaga taught me everything I know. He taught me to care for the details, that it was not necessary to sew on a button where it had no use, or to add a flower to make a dress beautiful ... no unnecessary detail.""
Among his American customers were Jacqueline Kennedy, who wore one of his designs to President John F. Kennedy's funeral in 1963, and movie goddess Grace Kelly, who became Princess of Monaco.
Perhaps his most loyal muse was Audrey Hepburn, who sported his dresses for three decades after they struck up a working relationship in 1963. It has been rumored that Givenchy first thought he was dealing with Katherine Hepburn when he was contacted about dressing Audrey for her movies.
PERFUME, FABRICS, HOTELS
As well as ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", Givenchy clothed Hepburn in ""Sabrina"", ""Funny Girl"", ""Charade"", ""How to Steal a Million"" and ""Bloodline"".
He dedicated ""L'Interdit"", his second of four perfumes, to Hepburn, and in 1988, when the state of California presented him with a Lifetime Achievement Award, she presided at the ceremony.
Givenchy branched out into menswear soon after opening his fashion house, and in 1970 he began designing furnishing fabrics. He also designed interiors for several hotels as well as a limited edition of Ford Continental cars.
Even today, Givenchy remains a star-studded brand. Under designer Riccardo Tisci (who recently joined Burberry) it became a hit with the Kardashians and was credited with attracting the most social media ""buzz"" during Paris fashion week.
The silver-haired, blue-eyed Givenchy was a prodigious worker in his time, starting weekdays sketching or choosing fabrics at 7 a.m. in his studio on the Avenue George V in Paris.
On holidays and at weekends he often retreated to his stone, moat-enclosed manor house in the countryside on the road to Tours, in western France, surrounded by Chinese, French and English antiques and fabrics of his own design.
After more than 30 years in charge, he sold his label to the French luxury goods group LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton in 1988, staying on under LVMH control before retiring in 1995. 
In addition to the Paris fashion house and boutiques in at least eight countries, LVMH also took ownership of 178 Givenchy licenses for perfumes, clothing, and interior decoration.

Givenchy now earns LVMH in the region of 110 million euros in annual sales, according to an estimate by investment analysts at the Bernstein financial services firm.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Most Russians intending to vote for Vladimir Putin in Sunday's election say stability is at the root of their faith in their candidate - though many young voters believe it's time for a change of leader.
Putin, 65, is expected to win a fourth term in office with 69 percent of the vote, according to the latest survey by a state-run pollster. 
Reuters correspondents and photographers who traveled around the country talking to voters ahead of the March 18 election found nothing to contradict expectation of an emphatic Putin victory.
(For a Russian election photo essay by Reuters click on http://reut.rs/2p4eHp4) 
In Crimea, participating in a Russian presidential election for the first time since the territory was annexed from Ukraine in 2014, engineer Andrei Lukinykh said Putin was the only candidate who could provide stability in tough times. 
""As the saying goes, you don't change your horses mid-stream. Unlike the others, my candidate can provide the stability that's needed,"" Lukinykh said.
For Muscovite student Yulia Dyuzheva, economic progress during Putin's 17 years in office won him her vote.
""As a representative of the younger generation, I can say that for us, young Russians, all the doors are open. Everyone is able to grab the opportunities presented and make the most of themselves, in whatever town or region,"" Dyuzheva said.
But others believe Russia is ready for a change. 
Accountant Natalia Dementieva, also from Moscow, said she was casting a vote for TV personality Ksenia Sobchak - one of seven other candidates - because she supported more freedoms.
""[Sobchak] speaks the truth, openly. She doesn't lie. She raises issues which are taboo under our government.""
""The next generation to rule this country were born between 1982 and 1987. There's a lot of them and they don't remember what it was like in the Soviet Union. So they're less afraid.""
Sobchak is expected to garner 2 percent of the vote, according to a March 9 poll by the state-run Russian Public Opinion Research Centre.
That's less than the 3 percent who plan to stay at home, some of whom may be heeding opposition leader Alexei Navalny's call to boycott the vote after he was barred from being on the ballot. 
From the Communist Party, wealthy farm boss Pavel Grudinin, 57, is set for a stronger showing, at 7 percent.
For Alexei Gruk, a mechanic from St Petersburg, voting for the Communist Party sends the signal that things need to change at home, but he wants Russia's foreign policy to stay the same. 
""To hell with the sanctions,"" Gruk said. ""So what if they don't bring foreign stuff here anymore? As if that means we have to give in. I don't care.""

Nationalist firebrand Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a veteran lawmaker, is expected to garner 5 percent of votes, according to latest polls, while liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky should receive 1 percent.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged his feuding coalition partners on Monday to remain in the government, despite speculation he was seeking its collapse and a snap election to help him survive corruption allegations.
The cabinet dispute is over the framing of a bill that would extend a long-standing military service exemption for ultra-Orthodox Jewish seminary students.
Opposition politicians and at least one coalition partner have suggested Netanyahu is not committed to resolving the issue and might actually prefer to let the government unravel.
An early election, political commentators said, could be used by Netanyahu to shore up public support before Israel's attorney-general decides, possibly months from now, whether to accept police recommendations to indict him in two graft cases.
Recent opinion polls have shown strong backing for his right-wing Likud party, even as he faces possible bribery charges in those investigations, suspicions of corruption in at least one other case, and testimony by three former aides who have turned state's witnesses. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.
In a statement on Monday, the four-term prime minister said he wanted to keep the current six-party coalition intact.
""I call on all the coalition partners, and chief among them Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, to remain in the government and continue this partnership in order to ensure security, prosperity and stability for the State of Israel,"" he said.
Netanyahu issued the statement minutes before Lieberman, head of the secular Yisrael Beitenu party that opposes the exemption, was due to comment on the bill backed by ultra-Orthodox factions. It passed a preliminary vote in a parliamentary committee on Monday.
FRICTION
As expected, Lieberman reiterated his rejection of the legislation but made clear his party, which has five of the coalition's 66 seats in the 120-member parliament, would stay in the government for now.
""As long as it (conscription bill) has not gone through second and third readings we will fight from within (the government). The moment it passes the second and third readings, we will draw our own conclusions,"" Lieberman said.
He was referring to votes in parliament that could be months away, a time gap that could leave room for compromise.
For decades the exemption from military service on religious grounds has caused friction in Israel, where most Jewish men and women are called up for military service when they turn 18.
The ultra-Orthodox say their study of the Torah is vital for the continued survival of the Jewish people and also fear that young men serving in the army would come into contact with women and with less pious elements in society.
Last September, Israel's Supreme Court gave parliament a year to pass a new conscription bill after ruling that parts of the existing exemption were unconstitutional.
Netanyahu has previously signaled he wants his government to serve a full term but has not ruled out an early election. The next election is not due until November 2019.

""I want to finish the term of this government, if the coalition leaders agree that is what will happen. If they don’t, then we’ll have early elections,"" he said last week during a trip to the United States.

Representatives of the group have made no application to attend the March 26-27 meeting in the Uzbek capital Tashkent, suggesting they will not attend, a ministry statement said.
Ghani is set to attend along with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan and European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini.
Also set to attend are the foreign ministers of India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Turkey and U.N. Special Representative for Afghanistan, Tadamichi Yamamoto.
The Taliban urged Washington last month to begin talks to end almost 17 years of war in Afghanistan, which suggests they want to explore dialogue.
The group ruled Afghanistan until 2001 when it was defeated by a U.S.-led troops in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks and it is fighting to restore Islamic rule in the country.
Ghani in February offered recognition of the Taliban as a legitimate political group as part of a proposed process he said could lead to talks.
Conference participants will call for an urgent start of direct talks between the Kabul government and the Taliban, the press office of Uzbekistan's foreign ministry said in a written reply to questions from Reuters.
The United States last year stepped up its military assistance to Afghanistan, notably through a sharp increase in air strikes, with the aim of breaking a stalemate with the insurgents and forcing them to the negotiating table.
While the U.S. military says the strategy has hit the Taliban hard, they still control or contest much of the country. On Monday, Afghan forces battled to recapture a district center in the western province of Farah, after Taliban fighters seized the town in an overnight attack.

VIENNA (Reuters) - With a party founded by ex-Nazis back in government, Austria marked the 80th anniversary of its annexation by Adolf Hitler's Germany on Monday with greater public self-examination than usual.
Hitler sent troops into Austria, the land of his birth, on March 12, 1938, in pursuit of his dream of a ""Greater Germany"". They were greeted by cheering crowds who waved swastika flags and made the Nazi salute. 
For decades after World War Two, Austria presented itself as the first victim of Nazism. While that official position has changed and now stresses the need for Austria to accept responsibility, there is still far less public discussion and commemoration of that chapter of its history than in Germany. 
The anniversary also coincides with the advent of a new conservative-led coalition government in Vienna that includes the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPO), founded by former Nazis in the 1950s.
""Austrians were not only victims but also perpetrators, often in positions of leadership,"" President Alexander Van der Bellen told a ceremony that included ministers from both Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conservative party and the FPO.
""Austria recognizes its responsibility,"" said Van der Bellen, a left-leaning environmentalist who beat the FPO candidate in a presidential election runoff in 2016.
SCEPTICISM
The FPO now focuses its criticism on Islam while courting Jewish voters and denouncing anti-Semitism. But Israel refuses to deal with FPO ministers and some Jewish leaders are skeptical about whether the party has really changed. 
The FPO is setting up a committee of historians to look into its past after two of its members' right-wing fraternities were involved in an anti-Semitism scandal.
The head of Austria's main Jewish organization, Oskar Deutsch, attended Monday's ceremony, though his group has stayed away from similar events in the past because of a self-imposed ban on dealing with the FPO. 
Deutsch expressed scepticism about the government's announcement on Sunday evening that it hopes to build a commemorative wall that would bear the names of the 66,000 Austrian victims of the Holocaust.
""I am not opposed to an additional monument in central Vienna, but a parliament without anti-Semitism and a government without German nationalist fraternity members would be more important,"" he said in a statement. 
At Monday's ceremony, held in the former imperial palace where Hitler addressed a crowd of hundreds of thousands to announce the annexation, or Anschluss in German, Van der Bellen urged Austrians to be vigilant about the threats to democracy.
""(Austrians must learn) the lesson that democracies too can fall victim to populism and demagogy, the lesson that discrimination is a first step towards dehumanization, the lesson that anti-Semitism and racism do not simply disappear but exist even today in big and small ways,"" he said.
Chancellor Kurz, a hardliner on immigration, said Austria had a duty to ""actively support Jewish life and fight every form of anti-Semitism, regardless of whether it has long been here or was freshly imported"".
""We also have a particular obligation towards the state of Israel and the need for security of Jews there.""

In what may be one of the worst British pedophile rings in recent history, girls were lured from their families to be drugged, beaten and raped, the newspaper said.
Telford lawmaker Lucy Allan said the newspaper's ­findings were ""extremely serious and shocking"" and demanded a public inquiry.
""I will be raising the matter with ministers in parliament and using every avenue available to ensure that the facts of what happened are made known,"" she wrote on her website.
Citing files from the local council in Telford, the Mirror newspaper said social services, teachers and mental health workers knew about the abuse but did not inform the police.
West Mercia Police said it took the issue ""extremely seriously"" but the information provided by the Mirror was not new and resulted from a number of high-profile cases including an operation in 2013.
""This was one of the first national complex critical investigations into grooming offences,"" Assistant Chief Constable Martin Evans said in a statement. ""It centered on historic offending in Telford and Wrekin and ultimately resulted in seven men being jailed for a total of 49 years.""
The newspaper said one schoolgirl became pregnant six times in four years. A 14-year-old had her phone number sold to pedophiles and was raped.
""I was told that if I said a word to anyone they’d come for my little sisters and tell my mum I was a prostitute,"" the girl was quoted as saying by the Mirror.
In 2014, revelations that as many as 1,400 children were sexually abused by gangs of predominantly Asian men in Rotherham shocked Britain. Eight men were found guilty in 2016 of waging what prosecutors called an “utterly abhorrent” campaign of sexual violence and intimidation against girls in the Rotherham area.

Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga met on Friday and promised to re-unite the country after 100 people were killed in clashes, mainly between opposition supporters and security forces.
The opposition National Super Alliance (NASA) coalition said it welcomed the new spirit of cooperation - though it warned that the suspension could be lifted if the government did not address divisive issues including land.
""We have accepted. We acknowledge that it is better to reason together than separately,"" the NASA Peoples Assembly Organising Committee said, in the first sign that rank-and file campaigners backed the leaders' surprise reconciliation.
The People's Assembly was announced in the wake of presidential election in August, and a repeat vote in October, both won by Kenyatta and both dismissed by the opposition as fraudulent.
Organizers at the time said the People's Assembly was not meant to be a parallel government, but other statements said citizens would be able to use it to ""exercise their sovereignty"" until what they called ""proper elections"" were held.
Several Kenyan counties set up their own local People's Assemblies, meant to be part of a central, national body, which has yet to meet.
Before Friday, Kenyatta and Odinga had defied calls from civil society, religious leaders and Western diplomats to hold talks to overcome deep divisions after the elections.

Violence during the two rounds of voting last year revived memories of the clashes that followed a contested 2007 vote, though the toll did not come close to the estimate 1,200 killed that time around.

Shortly before the United Nations was due to discuss Syria, Macron said Moscow, a close ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government, had not done enough to permit relief efforts into the rebel-held Damascus suburb of eastern Ghouta.
Asked about the Syrian conflict at a news conference in India, Macron said France would be ready to strike if it found ""irrefutable evidence"" chemical weapons had been used to kill.
""The day we have, in particular in tandem with our American partners, irrefutable proof that the red line was crossed -- namely the chemical weapons were used to lethal effect -- we will do what the Americans themselves did moreover a few months ago; we would put ourselves in position to proceed with targeted strikes,"" Macron said.
The French leader has made the threat before but has so far made little headway influencing events in Syria.
""We are cross-matching our own information with that of our allies but to put it very clearly we have an independent capacity to identify targets and launch strikes where needed.""
Syria signed a Russian-brokered deal to give up its arsenal of chemical weapons to avert U.S. air strikes after a nerve gas attack killed hundreds of people in 2013. Last year, the United States again accused Damascus of using nerve gas and launched air strikes.
Since then, Washington has repeatedly accused Damascus of using chlorine gas in attacks. Chlorine is far less deadly than nerve agents and possession of it is allowed for civilian purposes, but its use as a weapon is banned.
Damascus and Moscow have been carrying out a fierce bombing campaign and ground assault against the besieged rebel-held eastern Ghouta enclave since mid-February, despite a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for a countrywide ceasefire.

""This is a debate we will have in the coming hours at the United Nations, where it will be shown that the concessions on the ground from Russia, but first and foremost the Syrian regime and its Iranian allies, are insufficient,"" Macron said.

1354,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>",Norwegian political storm evokes Trump and Breivik,"By Gwladys Fouche
OSLO (Reuters) - A government minister has rocked Norway's traditionally consensual politics by accusing the opposition Labour Party - a target of the country's worst peacetime massacre - of putting terrorists' rights before national security.
Justice Minister Sylvi Listhaug's comments have drawn counter-accusations that she is trying to be more populist than President Donald Trump in a country where debate is usually much less confrontational than in the United States.
Listhaug, a member of the right-wing Progress Party, hit a raw nerve as most of Anders Behring Breivik's victims were at a Labour Party youth camp when he staged his attacks in 2011, killing 77 people.
The row erupted after Labour voted against a bill that Listhaug had proposed. This would give authorities the right, without judicial review, to strip individuals suspected of terrorism or of being foreign fighters of their Norwegian citizenship. Labour wants the courts to rule on such decisions.
On March 9, Listhaug posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) a picture of masked people clad in military fatigues, black scarves and ammunition with the text: ""Labour thinks terrorists' rights are more important than the nation's security. Like and Share"". 
The Christian Democrat Party - which the minority government of Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg needs to pass laws in parliament - criticized Listhaug.
""It is trashing the political debate in Norway when you accuse your opponents of things they don't stand for,"" Christian Democrat leader Knut Arild Hareide told broadcaster NRK. ""Sylvi Listhaug is trying to be better at being a populist than Trump.""
On July 22, 2011 Breivik staged the worst act of violence in Norway since World War Two, by placing a car bomb in central Oslo that killed eight and then gunning down 69 people, many of them teenagers, at the Labour camp on Utoeya Island.
Before the attacks, Breivik - an anti-Muslim neo-Nazi sometimes referred to by his initials ABB - had at one point been a member of the Progress Party. Afterwards Labour avoided using this to score political points against the Progress Party, which is now the junior partner in Solberg's coalition. 
""We were very careful not to link ABB and the Progress Party after July 22. Listhaug has now made it more difficult,"" tweeted Raymond Johansen, the Labour leader of Oslo's City Council.
""Our people know what it is like to be a victim of terrorism,"" he told Reuters on Monday. ""So when the justice minister criticizes Labour for our standpoint ... it is cynical and lacks respect.""
Listhaug was not available for further comment. 
She posted her comments on the day ""Utoeya July 22"", a movie about the massacre, opened in Oslo. 
Labour's general secretary Kjersti Stenseng challenged Listhaug: ""First, she should see the film. And then she should be ashamed of herself.""
A number of other films are in the pipeline about the attacks by Breivik, who is now in prison.
Paul Greengrass, director of the movie United 93 about the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, is planning a film for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). A Swedish documentary is expected in the autumn and a TV series is due next year.
Solberg also expressed her displeasure. ""It was too harsh a Facebook post,"" she told reporters on Monday.

Moments before the Sunday evening crash, the pilot sent a distress call over his radio, saying the engine had failed, according to the New York Daily News. The red helicopter, which had been privately chartered for a photo shoot, hit the water and turned upside down at about 7 p.m. EDT (23 GMT) near the northern end of Roosevelt Island, just east of Manhattan.
The National Transportation Safety Board, the federal agency that investigates civil aviation accidents, sent 14 officials to the city on Monday to determine the cause of the crash. 
At least two of the passengers were dead by the time rescue divers arrived, police and fire department officials said. The other three passengers, who had to be cut from the helicopter's safety harnesses, were declared dead at the hospital. 
The pilot managed to free himself from a safety harness and was later discharged in good health from hospital. The New York Police Department identified the pilot as Richard Vance, 33, but declined to release the victims' identities until their families were notified.
The helicopter was chartered from Liberty Helicopters, police said. The New Jersey-based company said on its website it has the largest fleet in the Northeast and had an ""unparalleled"" safety record.
The company did not respond immediately to questions about the crash on Monday.

Liberty Helicopters has been involved in at least two other crashes, according to news accounts, including a mid-air collision with a small plane in August 2009 over the Hudson River that killed nine people. In July 2007 one of its helicopters went down in the Hudson with a pilot and seven passengers aboard, all of whom were rescued.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Support for a presidential run by Brazil Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles is gaining strength within the country's largest party and he could be nominated over President Michel Temer for the October presidential race, party officials said.
Meirelles has until April 7 to decide whether to join Temer's Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB) party and resign as minister to run for president, a tricky decision because the ruling party could end up picking Temer if his numbers improve.
""Meirelles wants to join our party and we are still studying his request, but we cannot guarantee that he will be the candidate,"" a senior MDB official said, asking that he not be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
""Meirelles is courting the party and the party is courting him,"" said an MDB strategist, who also requested anonymity. ""The rank and file do not want Temer. His candidacy will not fly.""
Both Temer and Meirelles received about 1 percent of voter intentions in a recent Datafolha poll. Still, the ruling party is set on having its own presidential candidate, even if a stronger centrist candidate such as Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party defends its platform of market-friendly reforms and fiscal austerity.
With Brazil's most popular politician, leftist former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, likely barred from running due to a corruption conviction, the Oct. 7 election is wide open, with many potential candidates still polling in single digits.
Temer's closest political allies in the Cabinet are the main backers of his nomination, but the growing feeling in the party is that Meirelles would make a better candidate, one of the party sources said.
A rejection rate of more than 70 percent in polls is Temer's biggest problem and is seen as unsurmountable, the person said. 
Shouts of ""Out with Temer"" were common at Carnival (LON:CCL) parades last month among Brazilians who believe the former vice president backed the impeachment of leftist Dilma Rousseff in 2016 to take over and shield himself from corruption probes.
The president's recent decision to drop an unpopular plan to overhaul Brazil's generous social security system was not able to help his low single-digit approval rating.
Temer, 77, also runs the risk of getting further entangled in an ongoing corruption probe that led a Supreme Court justice to authorize investigators to look into his bank accounts.
Meirelles, 72, a former chairman of BankBoston, has not been snared by the graft scandals consuming Brasilia. The main obstacle to his candidacy is the lack of a party to support him, because his Social Democratic Party (PSD) plans to back Alckmin.
""Meirelles wants to be president. He will leave the PSD for the MDB. He feels it's now or never. He has the health and the energy,"" said a person with knowledge of his plans.
The finance minister's substantial personal fortune from his years in the private sector may help the case for his candidacy, as new limits on corporate funding for political campaigns have sent parties scrambling for cash.

Meirelles has said he will make his decision at the last minute and would not settle for being vice presidential candidate on someone else's ticket.

The Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDS) is owed more than $1 billion by electricity users, including domestic households, farmers, industries and mining companies.
ZETDC said in a public notice that businesses had six months to clear their bills because it required the money to pay for electricity imports to supplement local generation.
Zimbabwe, which has had stable electricity supplies for more than a year, currently produces 938 megawatts and imports up to 450 megawatts from South Africa and Mozambique.
Isaac Kwesu, the chief executive of the Chamber of Mines, said although some members had accrued huge bills over the years, they had made plans to clear the arrears with ZETDC.
""I know members will make all efforts to honor their dues because there is no one who can afford to have a mine closed,"" Kwesu said, but declined to name members with arrears.
Zimbabwe this month expects to commission two new generating units at the country's biggest hydro power plant, Kariba, which will add 300 megawatts of capacity.

SALISBURY, England (Reuters) - Worried residents in Salisbury said on Monday it was inexcusable that the authorities had taken so long to issue a health warning after a former Russian spy was attacked with a nerve agent in the city.
Public Health England on Sunday advised anyone who had been to a restaurant or a pub which Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia had visited prior to their poisoning to wash their clothes and belongings after traces of nerve agent were found in the two locations.
""It's inexcusable in some ways,"" Tim Bradley, a 62-year-old builder, told Reuters near the cordoned-off scene where the couple were found more than a week ago. He said he was ""very, very worried"" because the initial impression from the police and health chiefs had been that there was no cause for any alarm.
""You've got to think to yourself 'give them time to find out where the source is, what the nerve agent is, but personal safety, that should be straight out there,"" he said. ""That should be the number one objective - to inform the local people, to make sure that we're safe.""
Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter were found unconscious on a bench on March 4 and have been in a critical condition ever since. 
A police officer who initially responded is also in a serious but stable condition in hospital. Police have confirmed the Skripals had been poisoned with a nerve agent, although they have not disclosed what it was.
England's chief medical offer Sally Davies said traces of the poison had been found at a branch of Italian restaurant chain Zizzi and the Mill pub, both of which the Skripals had visited before falling ill.
She said she was confident that no one who was in the restaurant or the pub on March 4 or 5 had been harmed, but that their clothing should be washed and personal items like phones wiped as a precaution against any long-term exposure to any substance.
Despite the reassurances about the health risks, locals said the delayed warning had had the opposite effect.
Florist Daniel Styles, 32, who was unable to open his shop in a shopping center near where the former Russian spy was found, said the latest advice could create panic.

""That's more scary to be honest, saying 'wipe yourself down, clean yourself off from this nerve agent,'"" he told Reuters. ""That's not going to make you feel better. It's going to make you feel worse saying that really.""

Derryck John, 17, threw the corrosive liquid through the visors of motorcyclists in an attempt to blind them and steal their scooters – escaping twice with vehicles which he hid before returning to attempt more robberies, prosecutors said.
The use of acid in street attacks in Britain has risen sharply over the past two years, prompting the government to limit the sale of sulphuric acid and ban children from buying it.
John was the passenger on a moped, driven by an unidentified person, and carried out the attacks across East London last July.
""One of the victims has lost 30 percent of his eyesight which he will never recover - others described searing pain and burning at the time and have been forced to leave their jobs as a result of their injuries,"" said Ramesh Patel, of the Crown Prosecution Service.
""Had they not been wearing helmets, all of the victims’ injuries could have been much more serious,"" Patel added in a statement.
Detective Sergeant James Leeks said in a police statement on the case: ""Acid attacks ruin lives and have no place in our society.
""It beggars belief that anyone would be prepared to scar someone for life and leave them to live with life-changing injuries for the sake of a phone or a moped.""
John, who was caught on CCTV when he lifted his own helmet at a filling station, was sentenced at Wood Green Crown Court after admitting throwing acid.

At least eight raids struck the rebel-held towns of Busr al-Harir, Hrak, al-Gharaiya al-Gharbiya and al-Sowara in rural areas in eastern Deraa province in southern Syria, two rebel officials told Reuters.
The southern area around Deraa province is one of three main parts of the country where large populations are still under the control of rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad, along with a northern area near the Turkish border and the eastern Ghouta region on the outskirts of Damascus.
Government forces have focussed their efforts on eastern Ghouta since mid-February, launching one of the fiercest campaigns of the war now entering its eighth year.
One rebel commander said the strikes in the south appeared to be a warning to rebels under the Free Syrian Army (FSA) umbrella who were planning to wage an offensive in coming days to relieve pressure on their comrades in eastern Ghouta.
""We were starting an operation, and we had not announced zero hour, and the regime preempted us,"" said Abu Nabout, a military commander in Liwa Tawheed al-Jnoob, a rebel faction in the FSA rebel alliance.
Russia, which backs Syria's government in the civil war, and the United States, which has backed rebel forces seeking to topple Assad, met secretly in Jordan in June and announced a ceasefire in Syria's southwest a month later.
The truce had reduced fighting there and was meant to lead to a longer-lasting de-escalation, a step towards a full settlement.
Rebels have long feared Syria's army will return to attack them once it has consolidated gains in the north and other areas. Insurgents say the de-escalation zones free up Syria's army to make territorial gains elsewhere.
Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and more than 11 million made homeless in Syria's multi-sided civil war. The government has made huge territorial gains since Russia joined the fighting on the side of Assad in 2015.

In his bloody war on drugs, President Rodrigo Duterte had publicly named and shamed provincial politicians and businessmen as ""drug lords"" controlling the narcotics trade in the Southeast Asian nation.
""We are mindful of the zealous intention of the complainant to eliminate the illegal drug menace prevalent in our country today, and it is public knowledge that this fight has taken numerous lives,"" a Department of Justice panel said in a ruling seen by Reuters, dated Dec. 20 last year, but not made public.
But law enforcement agencies should ""gather more concrete and competent evidence proving that respondents and other individuals are indeed involved in illegal drugs trade,"" it added.
The justice secretary was not immediately available for comment on Monday.
The collapse of the cases will be a blow to Duterte, who has been criticised by political opponents and human rights groups for primarily targeting small-time users and dealers in a brutal campaign that has left drugs kingpins largely untouched.
Among the 22 people cleared were businessman Peter Go Lim and Kerwin Espinosa, who was arrested by Abu Dhabi police in October 2016. Espinosa's father, Rolando, was mayor of Albuera town in central Leyte province and surrendered in August 2016 to answer drugs charges.
He was killed three months later, in what police said was a shootout at a prison where he was detained. Activists and the opposition say the circumstances of his death were highly suspicious.

Since Duterte took office in June 2016, 4,021 people have been killed in what police call legitimate operations against ""drug personalities"" they say ended in shootouts. Police have blamed vigilantes for about 2,300 other drug-related homicides.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel and her partners met to formally sign their agreement on a new ""grand coalition"" government on Monday and admitted it was a political necessity, not a ""love match"".
At a news conference before signing the deal with the leaders of her Bavarian sister party and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), Merkel was asked if their stern faces boded ill for the new coalition.
""I can also look friendly,"" Merkel joked, drawing laughter. She added that the ""grand coalition"", Germany's fourth and her third, faced an array of global challenges, including new trade sanctions planned by the United States.
""We need Europe, a Europe that shares the same values and that acts jointly ... to deal with many of the big problems facing humanity, beginning with climate protection to fair trade to fighting the causes of migration,"" she said.
Merkel, embarking on her fourth term as chancellor, urged quick action to bridge differences among EU members on a common investment budget. She said she would travel to Paris soon to discuss with French President Emmanuel Macron his proposed eurozone reforms. [nB4N1FT02G] [nB4N1KO00V]
The new government will be sworn in Wednesday, after nearly six months of political limbo following an election that returned a fragmented parliament.
Acting SPD leader Olaf Scholz, who will head the finance ministry, said ""this isn't a love match from the get-go"", but the parties would work constructively together.
LET'S STICK TOGETHER
""In a world that is becoming more difficult ... it is essential that Europeans stick together and find and develop ways to take charge of their own future,"" he said.
Even as the three parties signed the coalition agreement, tensions were simmering both within the conservatives and between them and the SPD over issues ranging from combatting poverty to advertising for abortions.
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the new secretary general of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) on Monday chided fellow party member Jens Spahn, the incoming health minister, for comments on poverty that triggered outrage from SPD leaders.
Spahn had told the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper that recipients of unemployment benefit were not poor because their basic needs were met. Kramp-Karrenbauer said politicians with higher incomes should not presume to understand the plight of those on welfare.
Spahn sits on the CDU's right wing, while Kramp-Karrenbauer is a centrist in Merkel's mould. Both are seen as her possible successor.
Merkel was forced to negotiate a deal with the SPD after the failure of her attempts to form a three-way alliance with two smaller parties. 
Both the mainstream political blocs suffered their worst post-war election results in the September election. Frustration about the influx of more than a million migrants since 2015 propelled the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) into parliament for the first time.
AfD leader Alexander Gauland told reporters his party was already reshaping politics.
""Spahn would not have become minister if his views weren't resonating in the CDU,"" he said, adding that the election results had spurred Merkel to listen to critical voices in her party. ""And this new insight is thanks to the fact that the AfD has such a great result in the election.""

Kramp-Karrenbauer said the two blocs would strive for ""constructive"" cooperation, but criticised efforts by the SPD to reverse a ban on abortion advertising.

1368,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",Colombia legislative poll results could dent leftist Petro's presidency hopes,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - A dismal showing by Colombia's left-wing Decencia coalition in legislative voting could bode poorly for its candidate, Gustavo Petro, in a looming presidential election, while in party primaries right-wing rival Ivan Duque scored a more emphatic victory.
The outcome of the lower house and Senate elections and primaries for left and right-wing parties, all held on Sunday, were keenly watched as the deeply polarized Andean country heads towards an election set for May 27.
Investors have been uneasy over possibility of Petro, a former member of the disbanded M-19 guerrilla group and ex-mayor of Bogota, winning the presidency as he has been running neck and neck with Duque in opinion polls.
But in Sunday's legislative elections, Petro's Decencia won just 1.7 percent of the vote in the lower house and 3.4 percent in the Senate.
Colombian left-wingers advocate investment in education, as well as strong support for a recent peace deal with Marxist rebels, to combat profound inequality. And investors have been wary of Petro's promise to create a ""social economy"" that would shift away from oil, Colombia's top export, toward agriculture.
Petro, whose coalition does not represent all of the country's left-wing parties, had a far less emphatic primary victory than Duque, polling 40 percent fewer votes to secure the candidacy for his coalition.
More than 6 million votes were cast in the three-way right-wing primary and 3.5 million in the two-way left-wing contest. Some voters will have voted strategically and may not back either winner in the presidential vote.
Duque, a protégé of former president Alvaro Uribe, backs foreign investment and an aggressive security strategy meant to combat the country's remaining rebel group, which regularly bombs oil pipelines.
While no party came close to winning control of either the lower house or Senate, with results still not finalized early on Monday, Duque's Democratic Center party was polling the largest number of votes for the Senate, with more than 2.5 million, and was running second in votes for the lower house.
Right-wing politicians have pointed at the troubles of neighboring Venezuela to raise fears that a left wing victory could lead to economic collapse.
""We do not want the temptations of the populist authoritarianism that ruined Venezuela to come to our country,"" Duque told supporters as the results began filtering through.
Duque and Petro are not the only candidates running for the presidency.
Sergio Fajardo, a former mayor of Medellin, and ex-vice president German Vargas Lleras have both entered the field without having had to contest inter-party primaries. 
They both favor improvements to infrastructure and tax cuts for businesses, though Fajardo is considered left-leaning.
Duque and Vargas Lleras, from the Radical Change party, have strong party machines behind them and can count on backing in Congress should either of them win the presidency.

The two parties in Fajardo's coalition won just under 9 percent of votes in the lower house and 13 percent in the Senate.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The chief of South Korea's financial watchdog, who faces allegations of involvement in hiring irregularities when he was at a major commercial bank, offered to resign on Monday, the regulatory agency said.
Korean media reports have alleged that Choe Heung-sik, head of the Financial Supervisory Services (FSS) since September, in 2013 asked Hana Financial Group to illegally hire the son of a colleague.
In a statement on Monday, Choe denied any wrongdoing, saying that he was never involved in the bank's personnel decisions and did not conduct any ""illegal acts"".
""However, my actions at the time might not fit the current public sentiment"", he said in the statement released by the FSC.
Choe's statement said it was his duty to step down ""in order to ensure the impartiality of the FSC, which is investigating employment irregularities in the financial sector"".
President Moon Jae-in has yet to accept or decline his offer of his resignation, an official at the Blue House said. 
From 2012 until 2014, Choe was president of the Hana Financial Group, which owns KEB Hana Bank, South Korea's biggest lender.

1371,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 08:53AM ET</span>","For poor Venezuelans, a box of food may sway vote for Maduro","By Andreina Aponte and Ana Isabel Martinez
CARACAS (Reuters) - A bag of rice on a hungry family's kitchen table could be the key to Nicolas Maduro retaining the support of poor Venezuelans in May's presidential election.
For millions of Venezuelans suffering an unprecedented economic crisis, a monthly handout of a box of heavily-subsidized basic food supplies by Maduro's unpopular government has offered a tenuous lifeline in their once-prosperous OPEC nation.
The 55-year-old successor to Hugo Chavez introduced the so-called CLAP boxes in 2016 in a signature policy of his rule, continuing the socialist government's strategy of seeking public support with cash bonuses and other giveaways. 
Now, running for re-election on May 20, Maduro says the CLAPs are his ""most powerful weapon"" to combat an ""economic war"" being waged by Washington, which brands him a ""dictator"" and has imposed sanctions.
Mariana, a single mother who lives in the poor hillside neighborhood of Petare in the capital Caracas, says the handouts will decide her vote.
""I and other women I know are going to vote for Maduro because he's promising to keep giving CLAPs, which at least help fix some problems,"" said the 30-year-old cook, who asked not to give her surname for fear of losing the benefit.
""When you earn minimum wage, which doesn't cover exorbitant prices, the box helps.""
Maduro's rule since 2013 has coincided with a deep recession caused by a plunge in global oil prices and failed state-led economic policies.
Yet the worse the economy gets, the more dependent some poor Venezuelans become on the state. 
Life in the South American country's poor 'barrios' revolves around the CLAP boxes. According to the government, six million families receive the benefit, from a population of around 30 million people.
Venezuelans, many of whom are undernourished, anxiously wait for their monthly delivery, and a thriving black market has sprung up to sell CLAP products.
The government sources almost all the CLAP goods from abroad, especially from Mexico, since Venezuela's food production has shriveled and currency controls restrict private imports. 
Critics, including Maduro's main challenger for the May 20 vote, Henri Falcon, say the CLAPs are a cynical form of political patronage and are rife with corruption.
Erratic supply and control of distribution by government-affiliated groups have sown resentment among others. 
""I can't count on it. Sometimes it comes, sometimes not,"" said Viviana Colmenares, 24, an unemployed mother of six struggling to get by in Petare.
""INSTRUMENT OF THE REVOLUTION""
Stamped with the faces of Maduro and Chavez, the CLAP boxes usually contain rice, pasta, grains, cooking oil, powdered milk, canned tuna and other basic goods. Recipients pay 25,000 bolivars per box, or about $0.12 at the black market rate.
That is a godsend in a country where the minimum monthly wage is less than $2 at that rate - and would be swallowed up by two boxes of eggs or a small tin of powdered milk.
Inflation, at more than 4,000 percent annually according to opposition data, is pulverizing household income. 
The administration of the CLAP - the Local Supply and Production Committees - does not hide its political motivation. 
""The CLAPs are here to stay. They are an instrument of the revolution,"" said Freddy Bernal, CLAP chief administrator.
""It has helped us stop a social explosion and enabled us to win elections and to keep winning them,"" he told Reuters, referring to government victories in 2017 local polls.
Sometimes, though, the tactic backfires, as it did when promised free pork failed to arrive over Christmas, prompting street protests.
Maduro's inability to halt rising hunger has jarred with the experience of many under Chavez, who won the presidency in 1998 and improved Venezuela's social indicators with oil-fueled welfare policies. 
Even though Maduro's approval rating is only around 26 percent, according to one recent poll, his re-election looks likely as Venezuela's opposition coalition is boycotting the vote on accusations it is rigged.
His most popular rivals are banned from standing and the election board favors the government.
Former state governor Falcon has broken with the coalition to stand. One survey by pollster Datanalisis in February showed that in a two-way race, he would defeat Maduro by 45.8 percent to 32.2 percent of likely voters.
Falcon's critics counter that those numbers mean nothing in the face of electoral irregularities that could arbitrarily tip the balance in favor of Maduro.
Several other minor figures have registered for the single-round election, but have little chance of making an impact.
'CAN'T DEPEND ON THE BOX'
Juan Luis Hernandez, a food specialist at the Central University of Venezuela, estimates the country generates just 44 percent of the basic food supplies it produced in 2008. 
Meanwhile, food imports fell 67 percent between the start of 2016 and the end of 2017 as the crisis bit, he said.
Almost two-thirds of Venezuelans surveyed in a university study published in February said they had lost on average 11 kilograms (24 lbs) in body weight last year. Eighty-seven percent were assessed to live in poverty.
The same study found that seven out of 10 Venezuelans had received CLAPs.
""They (the government) don't care about the food issue, just about getting people something to eat while they get through the elections,"" said Susana Raffalli, a consultant with charity Caritas. 
Some Venezuelans fear they would be found out should they vote against Maduro and be punished by no longer receiving food bags. 
Already handouts are far from guaranteed. 
A dozen recipients told Reuters that often they arrived half-full and would only come every few months. Outside of the capital Caracas, delivery was even more sporadic.
""I can't depend on the box, otherwise I would die from hunger,"" said Yuni Perez, a 48-year-old rubbish collector and mother of three. 
Perez, who lives in a ramshackle house made from breeze blocks and corrugated steel at the top of Petare, said a CLAP box provided her family with food for a week. Often they would receive one every two months.
When her family is short of food, she hunts for leftovers dumped on the side of Petare's winding streets. She said she had found several newborn babies discarded in the gutter, which she attributed to mothers unable to face providing food for another child. 
Another Petare resident, mother-of-three Yaneidy Guzman said she dropped from 68kg to 48kg last year, despite receiving the CLAP. 

""At least for 10 days you don't have to think about finding food,"" the 32-year-old said of the handouts, her cheekbones protruding from her face.

The March 4 election ended in stalemate, with an alliance of center-right and far-right parties falling 49 seats short of a majority in the lower house of parliament. The largest single party, the 5-Star Movement, was 95 seats adrift.
Either group could govern if they win the backing of the center-left bloc, dominated by the PD, which picked up just 112 seats in the 630-seat lower house. The PD could also provide both camps with a majority in the upper house Senate.
The PD's outgoing leader, Matteo Renzi, has said his party will head into opposition and has ruled out hooking up with either the conservative bloc or the anti-establishment 5-Star.
Berlusconi told La Stampa newspaper the election result meant he and his rightist allies had ""the right, and above all the duty, to lead the next government"", and he called on the PD to show a sense of responsibility.
""Nobody ... can ignore the country's need to be governed,"" he said, adding it would be much better to take ""a few weeks"" to put together a coalition rather than rush to a new election.
""... New elections would be both a dreadful sign for our democracy and would probably lead to a dead end,"" he said.
For the first time in his 25 years in politics, Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party was beaten into second place within his alliance by the far-right, anti-immigrant League, led by Matteo Salvini.
Centre-left politicians have suggested the League should break ranks with its conservative allies and join forces in parliament with the 5-Star.
""I categorically rule this out. I trust Salvini's loyalty and his political intelligence. I cannot see how a party in our coalition could imagine cooperating with a 5-Star government,"" Berlusconi said.
While the right and the 5-Star jostle for position to form the next government, senior PD members are to meet on Monday to start plotting a new course after their election rout.
They are expected to establish a timetable for a leadership battle following Renzi's resignation. The meeting might also make clearer if there is any support within the party to help their opponents form a government.
The new parliament meets for the first time on March 23. One of its first duties will be to elect presidents for the two chambers, which will give a first glimpse of party dynamics within the legislature. 
Salvini indicated at the weekend that the League should lead one house and the 5-Star the other. However, looking to forge ties with the center-left, Forza Italia suggested the conservatives should back a PD candidate in one of the chambers.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - A Bangladeshi airliner crashed on Monday after making an unexpected turn in cloudy weather as it came in to land at the airport in Nepal's capital, killing at least 50 people, officials said.
(Map: http://tmsnrt.rs/2FznJk8)
There were 71 people on board the US-Bangla Airlines plane arriving from Dhaka when it clipped the fence at Kathmandu and burst into flames, said Raj Kumar Chettri, the general manager of the hill-ringed airport.
Those aboard included 33 Nepali passengers, with 32 from Bangladesh, one from China and one from the Maldives.
""All of a sudden the plane shook violently and there was a loud bang,"" one of the survivors, Basanta Bohora, told the Kathmandu Post daily. ""I was seated near a window and was able to break out of the window.""
The accident was the latest to hit mountainous Nepal, which has a poor record of air safety. Small aircraft ply an extensive domestic network and often run into trouble at remote airstrips.
""We have recovered 50 dead bodies so far,"" said army spokesman Gokul Bhandari. Although several people had been rescued from the burning wreckage of the Bombardier Q400 series aircraft, nine people were still unaccounted for, he added.
Chettri said that moments after the plane received permission to land, the pilot said he wanted to go in a northern direction. Asked by the control tower if there was a problem, he replied in the negative.
The plane was then seen making two rounds in a northeast direction, Chettri said. Traffic controllers again asked the pilot if things were OK, and he replied, ""Yes"".
The tower then told the pilot his alignment was not correct, but there was no reply, Chettri added.
""The plane should have come from the right direction,"" Chettri said, adding that it hit the airport fence, touched the ground and then caught fire.
It was not immediately clear if the pilot had issued a ""Mayday"" call, or distress signal.
Many of the bodies that lay on the tarmac, covered with cloth, were charred, witnesses said. Thick plumes of smoke could be seen from the aircraft at the Tribhuvan International Airport.
The aircraft that went down on Monday was 17 years old, data from tracking website Flightradar24.com showed. It descended to an airport altitude of 4,400 feet (1,341 m) and then climbed to 6,600 feet (2,012 m) before crashing about two minutes later, the website said.
Bombardier said on Twitter it was saddened by the accident.
""Our thoughts are with those injured, and their families,"" it said. ""More information to follow.""
There have been a series of accidents at Kathmandu in the past. 
In March 2014, a flock of birds shattered the windshield of a Malaysia Airlines (KL:MASM) jet as it landed in Kathmandu. The same month, a rear wheel of an Airbus A320 operated by an Indian budget airline caught fire after landing. 
In 1992, all 167 people aboard were killed when a Thai Airways flight from Bangkok crashed while trying to land in Kathmandu.
US-Bangla Airlines is a unit of the US-Bangla Group, a U.S. Bangladeshi joint venture company.
The two pilots and two cabin crew were Bangladeshi nationals, airline spokesman Kamrul Islam said in Dhaka.
""Our team will fly to Nepal as soon as the airport is open,"" he added. ""We are in touch with Nepali authorities.""

The Bangladeshi carrier, which launched operations in July 2014, operates Bombardier and Boeing (N:BA) aircraft.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean lawmaker submitted his resignation to the National Assembly on Monday and abandoned ambitions to become Seoul's mayor, becoming the latest casualty in a spate of embarrassing allegations against members of the ruling party.
A senior official in President Moon Jae-in's Democratic Party told Reuters on Friday that the party would adopt ""zero tolerance"" over sexual abuse, and would vet the candidates it fields in looming regional polls more rigorously. 
Discussion of sexual misconduct has long been taboo in South Korea but in recent months the #MeToo movement has snowballed, with allegations made against a number of high-profile figures across various fields, from the entertainment industry to the religious community and literary world. 
Just a week after a rising star, regarded as a potential future president, quit after being accused of sexual assault by a former aide in a dramatic television interview, the Democratic Party suffered more damaging allegations against senior members.
On Monday, lawmaker Min Byung-doo submitted his resignation to the National Assembly, after a woman accused him of sexual harassment at a karaoke room. 
Min said he could not recall the incident but he nevertheless intended to resign from his parliamentary post and withdraw from the primary to be the party's mayoral candidate in the upcoming regional polls.
Min could not be reached for comment, but an aide who answered the phone at his office confirmed his resignation.
Min's resignation letter has been submitted to the National Assembly, which will decide whether or not to accept his offer, the aide, who declined to be identified, said. 
Another candidate in the party's mayoral primary, former lawmaker Chung Bong-ju, has also been accused of sexual harassment, but he told journalists in the National Assembly on Monday that he was innocent and would continue with his election bid.
The controversies come after the Democratic Party was rocked by sexual assault allegations against An Hee-jung, a high-profile provincial governor who was seen as a potential contender in the next presidential election.
An resigned from his position and said he was leaving politics after a former aide accused him of sexual assault in a dramatic television interview earlier this month. An has said he would fully cooperate with a criminal investigation.
In a poll released on Sunday by South Korea's JoongAng Sunday magazine, nearly 73 percent of respondents said An's sexual abuse scandal would affect the local elections in June.
""We are going to strengthen the party's vetting processes for potential candidates starting with the upcoming regional elections in June,"" Nam In-soon, who chairs a Democratic Party committee established to prevent sex abuse, told Reuters.
""We will enforce a zero tolerance policy for all kinds of sexual violence and domestic abuse.""

DHAKA (Reuters) - A Bangladeshi court is due to decide on Monday whether to grant bail to former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia who was jailed last month for five years for graft, with its decision likely to have far-reaching ramifications for politics and security.
Zia is a two-term prime minister whose bitter rivalry with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has defined Bangladeshi politics for years.
Their feud hangs over the run-up to a December election with Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) vowing to boycott the polls in a protest against what it says is Zia's unfair jailing on trumped up charges.
A court decision to release Zia could open the door to the possibility of her party's participation in the general election, said party secretary-general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir.
""Without her, the election will be meaningless and it won't be acceptable to us,"" Alamgir told Reuters.
""Her confinement will be one of the factors in making our decisions,"" Alamgir said, though adding that unless the judgment against her is overturned, she would not be able to contest the election even if released on bail.
Under Bangladesh electoral rules, anyone jailed for more than two years cannot contest an election for five years.
The BNP boycotted the last polls, in 2014, in a protest against Hasina's scrapping of the practice of having a caretaker government oversee elections.
A boycott again in December would again give the prime minister's Awami League a clear run at power when the opposition could be benefiting from voter frustration with prices, unemployment, power cuts and anger over what many see as heavy-handed government tactics against opponents.
Another boycott would also dash any hopes of stability, and raise risks for the country’s garment industry, which accounts for 80 percent of exports, which could face disruption by transport blockades in the event of unrest.
""People are coming out onto the streets,"" Alamgir said, despite the detention of thousands of protesting party members since Zia was jailed on Feb. 8. [nL4N1PY3LC]
'TOXIC' POLITICS
At the same time, efforts to combat Islamist militants behind a string of bloody attacks in recent years risk being hampered by turmoil.
""Politics could become even more toxic,"" the International Crisis Group think-tank said in a recent note.
""The government's continued marginalisation of BNP and its forcing underground of opponents like Jamaat-e-Islami, risk sapping resources from efforts to disrupt jihadists.""
Jamaat, Bangladesh's largest Islamist party and an ally of the BNP, has been accused of inciting militancy. 
It denies that and opposition parties have denounced the crackdown on Jamaat leaders as a way to silence rivals. [nL4N1ML44F]
The BNP says the case against Zia is politically motivated by a ruling party riding roughshod over human rights and the rule of law.
""This is a totally one-party-rule here and it is totally dictatorial. Under these circumstances she's been convicted,"" Alamgir said.
Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan, a senior member of Hasina's party, denied that the government had any role in Zia's conviction, and said the BNP was merely trying to score political points with its accusations.
Khan said the government's decision to take in 700,000 Muslim refugees fleeing violence in neighboring Myanmar was proof enough of its standing.

""Our sheltering of Rohingya refugees itself shows that the government is upholding human rights,"" Khan said, referring to the persecuted Muslim minority from Myanmar.

1380,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 10:52AM ET</span>",'Unsafe even to bury the dead' in besieged Syrian enclave,"AMMAN/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Thousands of families are sleeping in the open in the streets of the biggest town of Syria's rebel-held eastern Ghouta enclave, where there is no longer any room in packed cellars to shelter from government bombardment, local authorities said.
The army's onslaught in eastern Ghouta, backed by air and artillery strikes, has killed about 1,160 people since Feb. 18, a war monitor said, as President Bashar al-Assad seeks to crush the last big rebel stronghold near the capital Damascus.
Thousands of families have fled from the front lines to Douma, hoping to escape bombing. The opposition-controlled town council said on Monday the situation had become ""catastrophic"", with no more room below ground for civilians to hide.
At least 70 people had been buried in a town park because air strikes made it unsafe to reach the cemetery on the outskirts, it said.
In a video filmed inside Douma, one man cowering in a heavily damaged shelter said: ""It is completely uninhabitable. It is not even safe to put chickens in. There is no bathroom, just one toilet, and there are 300 people.""
Douma residents said dozens of people were trapped alive under rubble, with rescuers unable to reach them due to the intensity of the raids.
Government forces have now captured more than half the rebel enclave, entirely besieging Douma and the large town of Harasta, cutting them off from each other and neighboring areas with advances on Saturday and Sunday.
In an apparent sign of local discontent with the rebel policy of holding out, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group reported that hundreds of people protested in the town of Kafr Batna to demand a deal to end the onslaught. Shots were fired at the crowd by unknown people and one person was killed, it said. The spokesman for Failaq al-Rahman, the main rebel group there, was not immediately available for comment.
Jaish al-Islam, one of eastern Ghouta's main rebel groups, said on Monday it had reached an agreement with the government's ally Russia to evacuate wounded people, after communicating with Moscow through the United Nations.
A U.N. humanitarian spokeswoman said the United Nations was not part of that deal and still called for the urgent evacuation of more than 1,000 sick and wounded people in eastern Ghouta.
State television broadcasts from the government-controlled side of the battlefront showed dark grey clouds of smoke billowing from several places across a landscape of shattered buildings. A minaret had lost a chunk from one side of its slender tower. In the background, heavy vehicles could be heard rumbling past and the deep crump of explosions echoed around.
HALF-MILLION DEAD
The assault is one of the heaviest in the war, which enters its eighth year this week. The Observatory, said on Monday that the death toll had passed half a million people.
It has confirmed the deaths of 511,000 people, it said, and has the names of more than 350,000 of them. About 85 percent were killed by government forces and their allies, it said.
Eastern Ghouta has been besieged for years after many of its residents joined the initial protests against Assad's rule in 2011 that triggered the slide into civil war. The United Nations says 400,000 people live in the enclave, already suffering shortages of food and medicine even before the massive assault began in mid-February.
Assad and his ally Russia say the assault on eastern Ghouta is needed to end the rule of Islamist insurgents over the civilian population and to stop mortar fire on nearby Damascus. 
The ferocity of the assault has prompted condemnation from Western countries and calls from U.N. agencies for a ceasefire. Russia and Damascus say a ceasefire ordered by the U.N. Security Council does not protect the fighters in eastern Ghouta, arguing that they are members of banned terrorist groups. 
The United Nations has warned of dire shortages of food and medicine, where international deliveries have long been erratic and often obstructed before they could reach the enclave. A convoy of relief trucks crossed front lines into eastern Ghouta on Friday and unloaded all its food despite the fighting. 
The expulsion of the rebels from eastern Ghouta would represent their biggest defeat since they lost their enclave in Aleppo in December 2016. They still control large areas in the northwest and southwest and a few scattered pockets elsewhere but have been driven from most major population centers.

Across eastern Ghouta heavy aerial strikes continued on the towns of Irbeen, Harasta and other residential areas on Monday, state media said.

Naser Mehri, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said a large group of fighters had captured the center of Anar Dara district on Sunday night after hours of fighting, though police and intelligence service forces were still holding out in their headquarters.
The Taliban released pictures that appeared to show fighters in the town, where skirmishes were taking place on Monday. Taliban spokesman Qari Yousuf Ahmadi said 15 policemen had been killed and several military vehicles seized, along with a large quantity of ammunition.
The announcement came days after local officials said the Taliban had inflicted heavy losses on Afghan special forces in another district of Farah, a poor and isolated region where the government has long struggled to impose control.
The pressure on Farah has grown as U.S. air strikes and Afghan army operations have inflicted heavy casualties on Taliban fighters in neighboring Helmand province, the main opium region in Afghanistan and a heartland of the insurgency.
Afghan and U.S. commanders have been relatively upbeat about the course of the war since U.S. President Donald Trump announced a new and more robust military strategy last year, with more air strikes and greater support for Afghan forces.
But the fighting in Farah underlines the continuing strength of the movement, which controls or contests almost half the country and has so far rejected peace overtures from Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.
In January, the Farah provincial governor resigned, blaming political interference and corruption. Residents of Farah city have complained bitterly about security in the province, where some police units are alleged to collude with Taliban fighters, selling them weapons and ammunition.
Although they have failed so far to take any major provincial cities, the insurgents have several times seized district centers, even if they have often been driven off soon after by government reinforcements.
With the approach of milder spring weather, security officials have said they expect to see fighting surge across the country as the Taliban, fighting to drive out international forces and reimpose their version of strict Islamic law, step up pressure. 
The U.S. military's latest estimates from December show the Afghan government controls or has influence over 56 percent of districts, with insurgents controlling or contesting the rest.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May will bring Britain's parliament up to date on the investigation into a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy on Monday, and one senior lawmaker expected her to point the finger of blame at Moscow.
Russian President Vladimir Putin brushed off a question about the affair while visiting a grain centre in Krasnodar, southern Russia, saying British authorities should first ""get to the bottom of things,"" the BBC's Moscow correspondent wrote on Twitter. 
Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, have been in hospital in a critical condition since March 4 when they were found unconscious on a bench outside a shopping centre in the southern English cathedral city of Salisbury.
May has warned that if Russia is behind the poisoning of Skripal, a former colonel in GRU military intelligence, then Britain will respond robustly. Russia has denied any involvement in the attack which also struck down a British policeman.
The chairman of the British parliament's foreign affairs committee, Tom Tugendhat, said the attack looked like state-sponsored attempted murder and he thought May, who chaired a meeting of top ministers and security officials, would say Russia was responsible.
""Frankly I would be surprised if she did not point the finger at the Kremlin,"" Tugendhat told BBC radio. May will address parliament at about 1700 GMT.
Even though Britain has not officially blamed Russia, the affair has driven already poor relations lower. 
Russia's foreign ministry said London was whipping up anti-Russian hysteria while state TV went further, accusing Britain of poisoning Skripal as part of a special operation designed to spoil Russia's hosting of the soccer World Cup this summer.
Asked by the BBC whether Russia was involved, Putin said: ""We're dealing with agriculture here...& you talk to me about some tragedies. Get to the bottom of things there, then we'll discuss this"", the broadcaster's Moscow correspondent tweeted.
Tugendhat said Russia's so-called oligarchs, who have amassed fortunes during Putin's 18-year rule, should be denied entry to the luxuries of London and the West.
The British capital has been dubbed ""Londongrad"" due to the large quantities of Russian money that have poured in since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
British counter-terrorism police say a nerve agent - usually a small molecule that interferes with the transmission of nerve signals - was used on Skripal and his daughter. 
But they have refused to specify which poison was used. A British policeman who was one of the first to attend to the stricken spy was also affected by the nerve agent. He is now conscious in a serious but stable condition, police said.
WORLD CUP THREAT 
In a broadcast on Sunday, Russian state TV suggested Britain itself had poisoned Skripal to upset the soccer World Cup which Russia is hosting in June and July.
""They tried to pin the blame on Russia, but if you think it through the poisoning of the GRU (military intelligence) colonel was only advantageous to the British,"" Dmitry Kiselyov, the country's top pro-Kremlin presenter said.
""An excellent special operation,"" said Kiselyov. ""Skripal is cheap expendable material,"" he said, and after the special operation Russia would then have to ""justify itself"".
May last year said Putin was seeking to undermine the West and the international order by meddling in elections. She promised to ensure corrupt money does not flow into Britain from Russia.
""If we get to a position when we're able to attribute this attack then we will do so and the government will deliver an appropriate response,"" a spokesman for May said.
Putin, who took over as Kremlin chief from Boris Yeltsin on the last day of 1999, has denied allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and says the West has repeatedly tried to undermine Russian interests.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Skripal worked for British intelligence and the attack happened in Britain so it was not a matter for the Russian government.
Skripal betrayed dozens of Russian agents to British intelligence before his arrest in Moscow in 2004. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006, and in 2010 was given refuge in Britain after being exchanged for Russian spies.
British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson drew parallels between the poisoning of Skripal and the murder of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, who died in London in 2006 after drinking green tea laced with radioactive polonium-210.
""BABY WIPES""
A British public inquiry found the killing of Litvinenko had probably been approved by Putin and carried out by two Russians, Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoy - a former KGB bodyguard who later became a member of the Russian parliament.
Both denied responsibility, as did Moscow.
After Skripal was found slumped on a bench in Salisbury, health officials in Britain said there was no wider risk to public health.
Cordons remained in place in the city centre however and some police investigators wore full chemical and biological suits and the army was later deployed to help remove items from the scene. 
On Monday, a 30-year-old man who breached one of the cordons was sentenced to 16 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to assaulting a police officer, common assault and criminal damage.
Health chiefs on Sunday told hundreds of people who visited the city's Zizzi restaurant or the Bishop's Mill pub to wash their clothes after traces of the substance used to attack Skripal were found at both sites.
Jenny Harries, deputy medical director at Public Health England, suggested the public wipe down phones, handbags and other electronic items with baby wipes and wash items such as jewellery and spectacles with warm water and detergent.

1383,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 03:31AM ET</span>","China's attendance at Vatican organ conference hailed as boon to ties, peace","BEIJING (Reuters) - China's attendance at a Vatican conference on combating organ trafficking underlines improving ties between China and the Church and will build momentum for better relations in other areas, a former senior Chinese official said.
Communist China and the Vatican do not have formal diplomatic relations but negotiations towards what would be a breakthrough agreement on the appointment of bishops have made progress, the deputy head of the official Chinese Catholics association said last week.
Chinese academics will join the Vatican conference on Monday and Tuesday, for the second year in a row, state media reported.
""Relations between Beijing and the Vatican authorities are moving forward. So are relations between the two peoples,"" Huang Jiefu, a former Chinese vice-minister of health and current head of the National Human Organ Donation and Transplant Committee, was cited in the state-run Global Times as saying. 
""The exchanges are beneficial to world peace and are also beneficial to people from the two sides,"" said Huang, who attended the conference last year. ""It also creates good momentum to expand contact beyond the health sector to cultural and other areas.""
Last year, the government played down the significance of China's attendance at the conference, saying it probably had nothing to do with two-way ties. 
The Global Times said late on Sunday that China would present its efforts to combat organ trafficking and progress on organ donation and transplants at the conference.
For years, organ trafficking was a sensitive issue for China and it repeatedly denied accusations by human rights researchers and scholars that it forcibly took organs from executed prisoners.
In 2015, it banned the systematic use of organs from executed prisoners.
Signs of rapprochement between the Vatican and China have sparked some criticism among Catholic officials in the region. 
Cardinal Joseph Zen, the outspoken former bishop of Hong Kong, has said the Vatican was ""selling out"" the Catholic Church in China and suggested that there was discord between the pontiff and Vatican diplomats doing groundwork in China.
China refuses to accept the authority of the pope, whom it sees as the head of a foreign state that has no right to meddle in China's affairs.
China's 12 million Catholics are split between ""underground"" communities that often recognize the pope and those registered with the state-controlled Catholic Patriotic Association, where bishops are appointed by the government and Chinese Church communities.
But a senior Vatican source told Reuters in February a deal between the two sides on the appointment of bishops could be signed within months.
An agreement would allow the Church to focus on expanding a Catholic presence in a country where Protestant churches are growing quickly.
The Vatican and Beijing have been at loggerheads since the expulsion of foreign missionaries from China after the Communists took power in 1949.

Another source of friction is the Vatican's official ties with self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing sees as a renegade province.

1384,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 02:50AM ET</span>",Artist Ai Weiwei unfazed by China ending presidential term limits,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - China's removal of presidential term limits, effectively letting President Xi Jinping hold office for life, will have no impact on the its culture, artist Ai Weiwei said on Monday, as he unveiled a giant artwork in Sydney depicting asylum seekers.
Ai, one of China’s most high-profile artists and political activists, has become a vocal campaigner on migration as the number of people forced from their homes - largely by violence and war - has reached a record 65 million.
In Sydney, Ai presented his 60-meter (197-ft) -long inflatable raft, carrying about 300 oversized human figures, a day after China removed the term limits from its constitution, raising concerns about a return to strongman rule.
""China has always been an imperial state,"" Ai, 60, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp in an interview.
""It doesn't matter if it's communist, now capitalism. It's a fatalistic society, so (if) it changes leader or not, the system and the culture always stays the same.""
First designed for the National Gallery of Prague, Ai's ""Law of the Journey"" is made from the rubber used by vessels carrying refugees across the Mediterranean Sea.
Installed on Cockatoo Island, a former shipbuilding site, it will serve as the centerpiece of the Sydney Biennale, running from Friday to June 11.
Ai said the location was appropriate because of Australia's controversial policy of detaining unauthorized boat arrivals in camps in the Pacific island nation of Nauru and Papua New Guinea's Manus Island.
""Australia's refugee record is quite poor, internationally,"" he added.
""There's no excuse for any kind of policy (that) should not consider protecting basic human rights.""
The artist, who helped design the stadium of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games but was arrested in 2011 following criticism of the ruling Chinese Comumunist Party, said he was not concerned the changes could bring a regime with ""no end"".
""Life is getting better,"" he said.
""So many youngsters study outside. The ideas to respect very basic human values are becoming more and more important for a society to maintain competition."" 
Ai is set to speak on Thursday at the Australian launch of his asylum-seeker documentary, ""Human Flow"", at the Sydney Opera House.

Ai, who has lived in Berlin since 2015, said he wanted the film to make people see refugees in a different light, as they were victims of man-made problems.

1387,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 06:57PM ET</span>",White House expects North Korea summit to happen despite Pyongyang's silence,"By Steve Holland and Christine Kim
WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - The White House said on Monday it fully expects an unprecedented meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to take place, if North Korea sticks to its promises, even though Pyongyang has yet to comment publicly on the possibility of a summit.
A South Korean delegation that visited North Korea last week said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un expressed a wish to meet Trump and South Korea's president to discuss denuclearisation. North Korean media has reported the South Korean visit, but no details of the talks.
Asked if the North Korean silence meant there was a chance the meeting between Trump and Kim would not take place, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said:
“We fully expect that it will. The offer was made and we’ve accepted. North Korea made several promises and we hope that they would stick to those promises and if so the meeting will go on as planned.
“We are continuing to prepare on a number of levels,"" she told a regular briefing.Earlier, South Korea said North Korea's silence on summits with both the United States and South Korea was probably due to caution in preparing for the meetings, while U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington expected to hear directly from Pyongyang.
""We have not seen nor received an official response from the North Korean regime regarding the North Korea-U.S. summit,"" said Baik Tae-hyun, spokesman for South Korea's Unification ministry.
""I feel they're approaching this matter with caution and they need time to organise their stance."" 
Tillerson said several steps would be necessary to agree the location and scope of the talks.
""It's very early stages. We've not heard anything directly back from North Korea but we expect to hear something directly from them,"" he said during a visit to Nigeria.
Tillerson, who has cut short his first trip to Africa as secretary of state to return to Washington on Tuesday, a day ahead of schedule, did not elaborate.
In an unexpected move last week, Trump agreed to hold a first-ever meeting with Kim, which South Korea said would take place by the end of May after a North-South summit in April.
News of possible talks has been a dramatic turnaround from fears of war over North Korea's development of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the United States.
Trump made the announcement after the head of a South Korean delegation that met Kim last week said the North Korean leader had committed to denuclearisation and pledged to refrain from nuclear and missile tests. 
Asked in a Fox News interview due to air on Monday evening whether there was a real possibility of North Korea denuclearizing, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said: ""We'll see, as the president often says."" 
But Pence called Kim's offers to cease missile and nuclear testing while not objecting to U.S.-South Korean military exercises ""a remarkable step forward"" and a result of Trump's tough approach.
""He's marshalled unprecedented economic and diplomatic pressure on the regime in North Korea and this breakthrough - and we hope it is a breakthrough - is a result of the strong leadership the president has provided on the world stage,"" Pence said.
Kim and South Korean president Moon Jae-in will meet at the truce village of Panmunjom straddling the Korean border, but a venue for the North Korea-U.S. summit has yet to be decided.
CHINA URGES PATIENCE 
U.S. national security adviser H.R. McMaster briefed U.N. Security Council envoys in New York on Monday. 
""We all agreed that we're optimistic about this opportunity but we're determined, we’re determined to keep up the campaign of maximum pressure until we see words matched with deeds and a real progress toward denuclearization,"" McMaster said.
South Korean U.N. Ambassador Cho Tae-yul, who also attended the McMaster briefing, described the plans for talks with North Korea as a “once in a lifetime opportunity.”
The South Korean officials who met Kim travelled to Washington last week to relay his message and visited China on Monday to brief President Xi Jinping, who urged patience.
South Korea's National Security Office chief, Chung Eui-yong, who led the delegation to Pyongyang, will head to Russia on Tuesday, while spy agency chief Suh Hoon met Japan's foreign minister in Tokyo, where he is to speak with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday.
In Beijing on Monday, Xi told Chung there was an important opportunity for talks.
""At the same time, all sides must exercise patience and be attentive, and show political wisdom, to appropriately face and dispel any problems and interference to resuming the talks process,"" state media cited Xi as saying.
Xi said China looked forward to smooth talks between the two Koreas and between the United States and North Korea and substantive progress in the denuclearisation process and normalisation of ties.
Tensions eased as the Koreas held talks against the backdrop of the Winter Olympics in South Korea last month but Japan has expressed scepticism and warned that ""talks for the sake of talks"" would be unacceptable.
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said after talks with Suh Hoon that Tokyo and Seoul agreed that maximum pressure must be maintained on North Korea until it takes concrete action to address concerns about its weapons programmes.
Kono declined to say what that action should be, but South Korea's presidential Blue House quoted him as saying that the breakthrough on talks with North Korea was a near ""miracle"".
In Geneva, the U.N. investigator on North Korea told the world body's Human Rights Council that any progress in the nuclear and security dialogue must be accompanied by talks on human rights violations, including political prison camps.
""Let me urge the DPRK to consolidate this rapprochement with a parallel opening to human rights review,"" said Tomas Ojea Quintana, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

North Korea's state media has lauded the thaw in relations with South Korea. It has continued to warn the United States and Japan against war-mongering but its rhetoric has been tame compared with threats exchanged at the height of tensions last year.

Maria Lourdes Sereno, the first woman to head the 15-member Supreme Court, faces impeachment over accusations she concealed wealth by not filing asset declaration statements for several years before she was appointed.
Sereno, 57, refuses to quit amid what she calls bullying by ""those in power"", which she says is threatening the independence of the judiciary.
""It is time to let go. Please let the judiciary move on,"" says a statement from five groups seeking Sereno's resignation, read during a Supreme Court flag-raising ceremony attended by several judges. 
Sereno is disliked by President Rodrigo Duterte and has voted against several of his controversial proposals, including extending martial law in restive Mindanao, and allowing late dictator Ferdinand Marcos to have a grave at a cemetery for national heroes. The Supreme Court allowed both. 
Duterte has accused her of being used by opponents who want to overthrow him, but he has denied having a hand in the impeachment of Sereno, who was appointed in 2012 by his predecessor, Benigno Aquino. 
The impeachment proceedings in Congress, which is dominated by Duterte's allies, ""have put the entire judiciary in disrepute"", says the statement, read by the court's employees' group head, Erwin Ocson.
The House justice committee last week found probable cause to impeach Sereno. She reiterated on Monday that she would not resign and said other judges had resisted pressure to join the campaign against her, so they could ""maintain the dignity and independence of the judiciary"".
""While the call to resign appeals to my love for the judiciary, it is also out of love for the judiciary that I must continue,"" Sereno told reporters.

If the House votes to impeach her, the 23 sitting Senators would serve as judges in a trial at the upper house of the bicameral legislature.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of farmers from India's western state of Maharashtra reached the state capital of Mumbai on Monday to protest what they called a lack of government support despite severe distress within the sector that employs the majority of the country's workforce.
The protestors walked 180 kilometres (112 miles) from Nashik to Mumbai over the course of a few days and plan to stage a sit-in protest outside the state legislative assembly building, where the annual budget session is underway.
The farmers are demanding waivers on agricultural loans in the aftermath of unseasonal rains that destroyed crops as also more support from the government, fair prices for crops and the transfer of forest lands to tribals, who have been tilling them for decades.
Road traffic was largely unaffected in the city as farmers reached south Mumbai on Sunday around midnight but police are on alert in case of possible traffic disruption later in the day.
This is the second major local protest by farmers in less than a year and has put pressure on the state government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, which has been facing farmers ire in various states.
Modi, who had promised to double farmers' income over five years, remains a popular leader nearly four years into his term. But unrest has flared in states ruled by his party, catching regional leaders flat-footed.
""The state government has started discussions with us. We will not end our protest until they give us written assurances around fulfilling our demands,"" said Ajit Nawale, state general secretary, All India Kisan Sabha, the organiser of the march.
The farmers wearing red caps and waving red communist party flags chanted slogans demanding higher food grain and milk prices in south Mumbai, where many big Indian companies and the central bank are headquartered.
Maharashtra, India's most prosperous state, had announced a farm loan waiver of 340 billion rupees ($5.23 billion) in June 2017, but the protest leaders said it failed to benefit all needy farmers.
The state has so far transferred 138 billion rupees to the accounts of 3.6 million farmers, state's Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said last week.
All major opposition parties and the Shiv Sena, a coalition partner in the state government, are supporting the protesting farmers.

Duque, a protégé of former President Alvaro Uribe and the standard bearer for the Democratic Center party, beat fellow candidates Marta Lucia Ramirez and Alejandro Ordonez for his coalition's nomination.
He got more than 3.9 million votes and 96 percent of the votes counted. 
Petro, a prominent leftist, former member of the disbanded M-19 guerrilla group and former mayor of Bogota, defeated Carlos Caicedo for their left-wing coalition's nomination, with 2.7 million votes and 96 percent of votes counted.
That represented about 30 percent fewer votes than Duque, though the two have been close in presidential vote polls.
Voters were allowed to vote in one primary and also voted in legislative elections, in which no party won a majority.
Many Colombians will have voted strategically in the primaries, hoping to influence candidate selection for the presidential vote on May 27.
Duque and Petro are among several other candidates running for the presidency, including former mayor of Medellin Sergio Fajardo and ex-vice president German Vargas Lleras.
Duque, 41, is a lawyer and senator who worked at the Inter-American Development Bank and United Nations. He has enjoyed solid showing in polls, coming within the margin of error behind Petro in the most recent presidential survey.
Supporters of 57-year-old Petro's Colombia Humana (NYSE:HUM) party highlight his work to improve conditions for the poor. He has pledged to create a ""social economy"" that will shift the economy from oil toward agriculture.
Some voters gathered outside polling places to protest a shortage of ballots for the primaries. But the head of the national registry, which runs voting in the Andean country, rejected suggestions to close polls later.
FARC MAKES DEBUT
No party won a majority in either legislature.
Duque's Democratic Center party was leading the number of votes in the Senate, with 88 percent reporting, with over 2.2 million of 15.6 million votes. The Radical Change party was second and the Liberal party third.
In the lower house, with 86 percent reporting, the Liberal party was leading, with more than 2.1 million votes of 15.3 million total. The Democratic Center party was a close second, with more than 2 million votes.
The elections mark the debut of the former FARC rebels as a political party. The group, which preserved its famous initials with its new name, the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force, demobilized under a 2016 peace deal.
The FARC is guaranteed five seats in both the 108-member Senate and the 172-member lower house under the terms of the accord. It fielded 74 legislative candidates but got only 0.22 percent of votes for the lower house and just 0.35 percent in the Senate.
The group's presidential candidate withdrew from the race last week due to ill health and the party is not naming a replacement.
Peace talks dominated elections in 2014. Now candidates in the 50 million-strong country are focusing on health, education, corruption and the economy.
""Now we've signed peace, the principal problem is corruption,"" 34-year-old construction worker Alvaro Jaimes said before voting in Bogota. Jaimes said he planned to vote for Petro in the left-wing primary.

High voter abstention is typical in the country. Just over 40 percent of eligible voters turned out for the legislative elections.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp failed on Monday to regain some veto power in the city's legislature in a pivotal by-election, struggling to draw what they hoped would be protest votes against creeping control from Communist Party rulers in Beijing.
The democrats won only two of four seats up for grabs, with the opposition now left one seat short from having the power to block most bills in the 70-seat legislative chamber.
The by-election marked the first time the democratic camp has lost its long standing veto power via the ballot box, raising fresh questions over the future of the struggle for democracy and autonomy in the freest city in greater China.
""The breakthrough in this by-election is a shot of confidence for our supporters and for people who hope Hong Kong can move forward and stop wasting energy with in-fighting,"" said Starry Lee, the leader of the city's largest pro-Beijing party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB). 
The polls were triggered when six pro-democracy lawmakers were ousted from public office over invalid oaths of office in a move that critics said was politically motivated - a move that cost them their veto power. The two remaining seats have yet to be filled.
Sunday's polls coincided with the historic vote in China's parliament that removed president Xi Jinping's term limits, giving him the right to stay in office indefinitely.
During a visit to the city last July, Xi warned Beijing wouldn't tolerate any challenge to its authority.
After more than a century of British colonial rule, Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula guaranteeing it a high degree of autonomy and the promise of eventual universal suffrage. 
Over the past two decades however, tensions have simmered and occasionally boiled over with activists pushing in vain for full democracy amidst opposition from Beijing. 
While some democrats had made appeals for votes to redress the injustice of the disqualifications and to safeguard the city's autonomy, they struggled to overturn what some saw as voter malaise.
""The pan-democrats have paid a huge price due to the recent political storms these few years,"" said Au Nok-hin, one of the democrat winners.
A turnout of 43 percent, far less than the 58 percent for full legislative council polls two years ago, suggested votes could have become fatigued with the democrats struggle.
""For the whole democratic camp it's a political defeat,"" said Ma Ngok, a political scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
""It gives people the impression that even if the government uses what people regard as problematic or even illegal means to strip lawmakers of their seats, or to disenfranchise the public, the public isn't reacting very strongly.""
The democrats' failure to regain veto power over most bills could effectively render the Hong Kong legislature a rubber-stamp parliament not unlike Beijing's National People's Congress.
The opposition, however, still has a chance to claw back that veto power when the by-elections are held for the remaining two seats vacated by the disqualifications - though no date for those contests has been set.
""The space for expression is getting narrower for Hong Kong,"" said voter Candy Chan, a 24-year-old fashion designer. ""While I haven't completely lost hope, my feeling is things will gradually get worse.""

(Reuters) - The planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has raised a California son's hope that a meeting will lead to the release of his father, held nearly a year by the reclusive state, the son said on Sunday.
Trump agreed on Thursday to accept an invitation from the North Korean leader to meet by May following months of tough talk by both men and rising tensions over Pyongyang's advancing nuclear and missile programs.
Three Americans are being held by North Korea, which has in the past used visits by former U.S. presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton to release other Americans it had in custody.
While there has been no sign the planned summit will lead to the release of Americans Kim Dong Chul, Kim Hak Song or Kim Sang-duk, also known as Tony Kim, word of the unprecedented talks was welcomed by Sol Kim, the son of Tony Kim.
""I am hopeful. It is hard to say any other feeling,"" Sol Kim, a 27-year-old student in California, said in a telephone interview.
U.S. officials have previously assured him his father's plight will be raised at appropriate times, he said.
""But as a family member, I hope that it is one of the top priorities"" of a face-to-face meeting, he said.
The U.S. government has had regular talks with the family but has not contacted them since the plans for the summit were announced, he said.
Over the last two decades, North Korea has held more than a dozen Americans as captives, typically using them as bargaining chips in its dealings with Washington.
'ATROCITIES'
But that dynamic changed after U.S. student Otto Warmbier, 22, died last summer shortly after his release from a 17-month detention.
His death led to new U.S. sanctions on North Korea, and a White House official said it served ""to remind the world of the atrocities that happen in North Korea.""
Tony Kim, 59, worked at the foreign-funded and Christian- affiliated Pyongyang University of Science and Technology. He was detained at Pyongyang International Airport in April 2017 while trying to leave the country. North Korean state media reported that he was arrested for committing ""hostile acts"" against the government.
Kim Hak Song, thought to be 55, also taught at PUST. He managed the school's experimental farm and was detained in May 2017 while traveling by train from Pyongyang to Chinese border town Dandong
A message attributed to him from 2015 on the website of a Korean-Brazilian church in Sao Paulo said he was a Christian missionary trying to help the North Korean people learn to become self-sufficient.
Kim Dong Chul, a Korean-American missionary formerly of Fairfax, Virginia and thought to be 62, was sentenced in March 2016 to 10 years of hard labor for subversion. Kim said he set up a business in the North Korean special economic zone of Rason in 2008, the North's officials KCNA news agency reported.
Trump's sudden decision to meet with Kim stunned even members of his own administration. On Sunday, U.S. officials defended the decision and said the United States expects North Korea to halt all nuclear and missile testing in advance of any meeting.

""As a family, any news, any update and any progress is good progress and it is hopeful,"" said Sol Kim.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his close ally, Finance Minister Taro Aso, faced growing pressure on Monday over a suspected cover-up of a cronyism scandal that has dogged the premier for more than a year.
Copies of documents seen by Reuters showed that references to Abe, his wife and Aso were removed from finance ministry records of the discounted sale of state-owned land to a school operator with ties to Abe's wife, Akie.
Abe, now in his sixth year in office, has denied that he or his wife did favors for the school operator, Moritomo Gakuen, and has said he would resign if evidence was found that they had.
Excised references seen by Reuters did not appear to show that Abe or his wife intervened directly in the deal. 
Suspicion of a cover-up could slash Abe's ratings and dash his hopes for a third term as leader of his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Victory in the LDP September leadership vote would put him on track to become Japan's longest-serving premier. 
The doubts are also putting pressure on Aso to resign.
""It could shake confidence in the administration as a whole. I strongly feel responsibility as the head of administration,"" Abe told reporters after the finance ministry reported on the altered documents. 
""I apologize to all of the people.""
Abe said he wanted Aso to make every effort to clarify all the facts and ensure such things do not happen again.
Aso told a separate news conference that several officials at his ministry's division in charge of the sale were involved in altering the documents to make them conform with testimony in parliament by the then-head of the division.
""It has become clear that there was a cover-up and falsification,"" opposition Democratic Party leader Yuichiro Tamaki told reporters. He said Aso should resign and parliament hold hearings on the matter.
The 77-year-old Aso, who is also deputy premier and whose backing is vital for Abe, apologized for his ministry's actions, but said that he had no intention of stepping down.
The risk for Aso and Abe, experts said, is that the suspected cover-up does more damage than the land sale itself.
""The cover-up is now a bigger issue than the original incident,"" said Koichi Nakano, a professor at Sophia University.
A finance ministry official said that 14 items had been altered in the documents after February last year - when the scandal broke - at the instruction of the ministry's financial division to match testimony in parliament.
ASO'S SURVIVAL?
One such reference was to Akie's visit to the school at the heart of the suspected scandal. Also removed was a reference to ties by Abe and Aso to a conservative lobby group, Nippon Kaigi.
The records include a comment from Yasunori Kagoike, the former head of Moritomo Gakuen, citing Akie Abe as telling him: ""This is good land so please proceed."" 
A kindergarten run by Moritomo Gakuen taught a nationalist curriculum in line with views espoused by Nippon Kaigi.
""At the very least, it seems that Aso's chances of surviving as finance minister are diminishing rapidly,"" wrote Tobias Harris, vice president of consultancy Teneo Intelligence, in an email. He said there was no ""smoking gun"" showing direct intervention by Abe or his wife.
But Harris added: ""It now seems to be more a question of whether Abe can manage an orderly exit at the end of his term in September or whether he'll resign hastily again - but I don't see how he can win a new mandate amidst the Abe fatigue that will surely grow after these revelations.""
A Sankei newspaper poll over the weekend said 71 percent of respondents said Aso should go. 
On Friday, National Tax Agency chief Nobuhisa Sagawa resigned over remarks in parliament last year about the case.
Sagawa headed the ministry division that submitted the documents before he was tapped as tax agency chief in July, an appointment critics saw as a reward for his efforts to diffuse the issue with his statements to parliament last year.
Some LDP members said politicians should not pass the buck to bureaucrats.
""It is inconceivable that the bureaucrats on the spot had such authority (to alter the documents),"" media quoted Shigeru Ishiba, an LDP lawmaker who has made no secret of his desire to challenge Abe in the party race, as saying on the weekend.
Abe, 63, swept back to power in December 2012 promising to revive the economy and bolster Japan's defense. It was a rare comeback for the conservative lawmaker, who quit abruptly in 2007 after a year in office marked by scandals in his cabinet, a deadlocked parliament and ill health. 
His ruling bloc won a two-thirds ""super majority"" in an October lower house poll, helped by opposition disarray.

A March 9-11 survey by the Yomiuri newspaper showed support for Abe's cabinet has now fallen to 48 percent, down six points from a month earlier. Non-support rose to 42 percent and 80 percent said that the matter had not been handled appropriately.

1395,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 03:55AM ET</span>",Pilot radioed for help before fatal crash in New York City's East River,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A helicopter carrying six people crashed in New York City's East River on Sunday, killing all passengers, while the pilot survived, police said.
Moments before it crashed into the frigid waters, the pilot frantically radioed for help, the New York Daily News and other media reported.
""Mayday, mayday, mayday,"" the pilot said, according to news accounts. ""Engine failure. We've got an engine failure over the East River.""
Two of the five passengers died at the scene and three were taken to two area hospitals where they later died, New York City Police and fire department officials confirmed early Monday.
The pilot freed himself and was rescued and later was treated and released in good condition from a hospital, police said. 
The Federal Aviation Administration said the Eurocopter AS350 went down near the northern end of Roosevelt Island at about 7 p.m. and was investigating. The National Transportation Safety Board said its investigative team would arrive on Monday.
""It's a great tragedy,"" said New York Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro at a press conference late Sunday. ""It took a while for the divers to get these people out.""
Nigro said when the divers reached the helicopter it was inverted and in 50 feet of water with below 40-degree Fahrenheit water temperatures and four-mile-an hour currents.
The passengers were tightly harnessed and the harnesses had to be cut and removed to free the passengers in the helicopter, he added.
A Reuters photographer witnessed three people recovered by rescue divers being wheeled on stretchers onto a midtown pier shortly before 9 p.m.
New York City Police Commissioner James O'Neill said the aircraft was registered to Liberty Helicopters, a sightseeing and charter service in New York, and was on a private charter ""photo shoot.""
The U.S. Coast Guard launched three boats to aid in the response, joining New York City emergency responders.
""It kind of hit sideways and just flipped over,"" Brianna Jesme, 22, an Upper East Side resident who witnessed the crash, told Reuters TV.
Video of the incident filmed by an onlooker and posted on Twitter showed a red helicopter descending toward the water at dusk, then landing with a large splash before tipping onto its right side, its tail lights still flashing.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.

The NYC Ferry said late Sunday on Twitter that service on the Astoria and East River routes was currently suspended until further notice because of the helicopter crash.

YANGON (Reuters) - After driving nearly 700,000 Rohingya Muslims out of the country, Myanmar's military is building bases where some of their homes and mosques once stood, Amnesty International said on Monday, citing new evidence from satellite imagery.
A harsh security response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents on Aug. 25 sent members of the mostly stateless minority fleeing to Bangladesh and saw more than 350 villages destroyed by fire in western Myanmar's Rakhine state.
An Amnesty report published on Monday echoed previous ones by saying the remains of some of those villages - and some buildings not previously damaged - had been bulldozed.
As well as rapid housing and road construction in the area, at least three new security facilities were under construction, the global human rights group said. In one case, Rohingya villagers who had remained in Myanmar were forcibly evicted to make way for a base, it said.
“What we are seeing in Rakhine State is a land grab by the military on a dramatic scale,"" Tirana Hassan, Amnesty's crisis response director, said in a statement. ""New bases are being erected to house the very same security forces that have committed crimes against humanity against Rohingya.""
At least four mosques that had not been wrecked by fire have been destroyed, or had their roofing or other materials removed, since late December, a time when significant conflict was not reported in the area, Amnesty said.
In one Rohingya village, satellite imagery showed buildings for a new border police post appearing next to where a recently demolished mosque had stood.
Spokespeople for the government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and the military were not immediately available for comment. Myanmar officials have said villages were being bulldozed to make way for new homes for returning refugees.
Myanmar has asked for ""clear evidence"" to support the conclusion of the United Nations and others that ethnic cleansing has taken place in Rakhine.
Myanmar and Bangladesh reached a deal in November to repatriate those who fled. Myanmar has said temporary camps to house returnees are ready, but the process has yet to start.
Amnesty said Myanmar's ""reshaping"" of the region where the Rohingya lived appeared to be designed to accommodate more security forces and non-Rohingya villagers, and could deter refugees from agreeing to return.
""Rohingya who fled death and destruction at the hands of the security forces are unlikely to find the prospect of living in close proximity to those same forces conducive to a safe return,"" the group said, ""especially given the continuing lack of accountability for human rights violations.""

1397,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>",BBC appeals to U.N. over 'collective punishment' of its journalists by Iran,"LONDON (Reuters) - British broadcaster the BBC said on Monday it was appealing to the United Nations to protect its journalists in Iran after it said persecution and harassment by the Iranian authorities escalated in 2017.
""The BBC is taking the unprecedented step of appealing to the United Nations because our own attempts to persuade the Iranian authorities to end their harassment have been completely ignored,"" BBC Director General Tony Hall said in a statement.
""In fact, during the past nine years, the collective punishment of BBC Persian Service journalists and their families has worsened.""
Britain's foreign secretary Boris Johnson said in December he had raised ""the official harassment of journalists working for BBC Persian and their families inside Iran"" with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif when he visited Tehran.
The broadcaster said journalists in London working on BBC Persian, part of the BBC World Service, and their families in Iran had been targeted since the satellite TV station launched in 2009.
The harassment escalated last year when Iranian authorities alleged the service's work was a crime against Iran's national security and froze the assets of more than 152 current and former BBC Persian staff, it said. 
BBC Persian said at the time that it was another step by Iran's judiciary to silence impartial journalists.
The BBC said other measures against its journalists included the arbitrary arrest and detention of family members in Iran, the confiscation of passports and travel bans preventing people leaving Iran and the spread of fake and defamatory news targeting individuals especially women journalists.  
Iran accused the BBC of inciting unrest after the disputed re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009 and has said its journalists had broadcast against the national interests of the Islamic Republic.
The following year it banned Iranians from contact with dozens of foreign organizations, including the BBC, which it said were seeking to topple the Islamic theocracy.
The BBC said it was planning a series of events in partnership with the International Federation of Journalists this week during the 37th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.

1398,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2018 07:11PM ET</span>","After protests, Slovak PM faces tough talks to keep government together","BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Following the biggest street protests in decades, Slovakia's long-serving Prime Minister Robert Fico faces a deadline on Monday to ditch his closest ally or risk breaking apart his coalition government. 
The death of investigative reporter Jan Kuciak, who probed fraud cases involving politically-connected businessmen, has stoked public anger over persistent corruption allegations and pushed Fico's government toward collapse.
In the largest protests since the fall of communism in 1989, an estimated 50,000 people rallied in Bratislava on Friday and thousands more in other cities, demanding the resignation of Fico's cabinet a thorough investigation of Kuciak's death.
Fico's junior partner in government, the Most-Hid (Bridge) group, has demanded Fico dismiss Interior Minister Robert Kalinak, a founding member of Fico's Smer party, by Monday.
Fico has resisted getting rid of Kalinak but, worried over losing Most-Hid's support, last week said he was ready to offer solutions to keep their support.
Without Most-Hid, a centrist group that represents the ethnic Hungarian minority in Slovakia, Fico will have to rule over a minority government but would need to rely on the support of far-right deputies, which some Smer members are against. An early election could follow.
Most-Hid's leadership will meet on Monday. Deputy Prime Minister and Smer official Peter Pellegrini said on Sunday some changes should be made. 
""We should make concessions, changes in government, that would satisfy our coalition partners and help stabilize tensions in society,"" he told the public broadcaster RTVS.
Even if Fico dismisses Kalinak, it may not satisfy Most-Hid. Many of its lawmakers were angered last week when Fico began referring to what the party called ""conspiracy theories that may threaten talks on government reconstruction"".
In attacks echoing those of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Fico has accused foreign forces of trying to destabilize Slovakia and has questioned the president's meetings with financier George Soros in New York last year.
Critics say Kalinak, who oversees the police as interior minister, cannot guarantee an independent investigation into the killing of Kuciak and his fiancee in late February.
Before he was shot dead, Kuciak had been investigating Italian businessmen in Slovakia with suspected mafia links. One of the Italians that Kuciak wrote about had co-owned firms with two Slovaks who went on to work in Fico's office. 
Both have resigned but deny links to the murder. Their Italian former business partner denies connections to the mafia. No one has been charged in the killings.
In the past, Kuciak had also written about a real-estate developer investigated for tax fraud who had business ties to Kalinak. Both have denied wrongdoing.
Fico's three-party coalition, also including centrist Slovak National Party (SNS), holds 78 of the 150 seats in parliament. 

If Fico can keep the coalition together, it is likely to still face a test as opposition parties are readying a no-confidence motion. They need 76 votes to topple the government, meaning defectors could be costly.

The explosion on a ferry docked at a Playa del Carmen pier was set off by a rudimentary or homemade device, acting Attorney General Alberto Elías Beltrán said at a news conference.
""The responsibility of terrorist organizations or organized crime has been ruled out,"" he said. Officials did not offer any details on who they believe was responsible. 
The explosion injured at least 25 people, including U.S. tourists. It marked another blow to the reputation of Mexico's tourism industry, as the country's soaring crime and long-running battle with drug cartels have increasingly disrupted resort towns.
Shortly before spring break, when thousands of U.S. college students descend on Mexican beach towns, the U.S. government on Wednesday barred its employees from traveling to Playa del Carmen. It cited an unspecified ""security threat"" and mentioning the blast. The government later limited the ban to certain neighborhoods.
Following the blast, the Mexico's federal police will increase its deployment in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo on the Yucatan Peninsula which includes Cancun. It will prioritize areas frequented by tourists, Manelich Castilla, the top federal police chief, said at the news conference. He stressed that the Mexican government has the resources to keep the peace in tourist destinations.
""Reservations have not been canceled, and the beaches are open, without incident,"" he said.
The ferry at the center of the explosion was operated by Barcos Caribe, which is owned by the family of former Quintana Roo Governor Roberto Borge, local media reported. Borge was extradited from Panama to Mexico in January and has been jailed on corruption charges. 
Barcos Caribe did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

1400,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>",Pope expresses concern over national policies dictated by fear,"By Giulia Segreti
MILAN (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday expressed concern over national policies dictated by fear, speaking only one week after Italy's general elections which brought populist and anti-immigrant parties to the forefront.
The pontiff, who has made the defense of migrants a key pillar of his five-year papacy, has repeatedly called for decisive action to solve political problems causing many to flee from their home countries.
Although the pope did not specifically refer to the elections, his words may resonate as a strong criticism of Italy's center-right bloc which has strongly campaigned using anti-migrant policy promises.
""The world today is often inhabited by fear. It is an ancient disease ... And fear often turns against people who are foreign, different, poor, as if they were enemies,"" said the leader of the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics.
""There are countries where plans are dictated by the fight against these people,"" the pontiff added, departing from his prepared text.
The pope was speaking at the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of Rome-based peace group Sant'Egidio Community, which has helped in the last two years about one thousand refugees, mainly Syrian, reach Italy through so-called humanitarian corridors. 
The Pope did not single out any country for criticism.
On Tuesday Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's Secretary of State, second only to the Pope in the Holy See's hierarchy, also signaled the Vatican's concern over the results of the vote. 
Anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the League, a center-right grouping that employed the most fiery anti-migrant rhetoric during the campaign, were the biggest winners at Italy's elections. 
The center-right has vowed to deport hundreds of thousands of migrants if they are able to form a government - even though that promise will be hard to keep - leaving many migrants in the country pondering over their future. 
The League's leader Matteo Salvini clashed with the Pope several times over immigration during the campaign and criticized him for promoting dialogue with Islam. 

The Argentine Pope, the first non-European elected to the post in nearly 1,300 years, has in the past criticized President Donald Trump's intention to build a wall to stop illegal migrants crossing the U.S. border with Mexico.

No details of the case were given, including when the person was arrested or where.
The judiciary's Mizan news agency said Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari-Dolatabadi had ""referred to a six-year prison sentence for an agent of England's intelligence service"".
It quoted him as saying the same British-Iranian citizen was also under investigation in a separate case related to a private bank, giving no further details.
Iran does not recognize dual citizenship, which limits the access foreign embassies have to their dual citizens held there.
A spokeswoman for Britain's foreign office was not immediately able to comment.
At least two British-Iranian citizens are known to be held in Iran, including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of the parent company of Reuters, whose case was taken up by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson during a visit to Iran in December.
She has been sentenced to five years for plotting the overthrow of Iran's government. Her employers and the British government say she was in Iran visiting relatives when she was arrested in April 2016.
Kamal Foroughi, a 78-year-old British-Iranian businessman, was arrested in 2011 and convicted of espionage and possessing alcohol charges.
Britain's foreign office says it has raised both cases with the Iranian authorities. In both cases, the families of those held deny the charges.
Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have arrested at least 30 dual nationals since 2015, mostly on spying charges, Reuters reported in November.

Kuczynski narrowly survived an impeachment bid in December but opposition lawmakers are making a new push to unseat the center-right leader over his ties to a Brazilian company at the heart of a massive Latin American-wide graft scandal.
The Ipsos poll, published by the newspaper El Comercio, found that 58 percent of Peruvians want Kuczynski to be impeached by Congress, versus 37 percent who would rather he continue in power.
A similar number would also be happy if he went voluntarily, instead - 56 percent want him to resign so Vice President Martin Vizcarra can govern the country, compared to 40 percent who think Kuczynski should finish his term as scheduled in 2021, the poll showed.
Kuczynski has repeatedly denied anything improper or illegal about payments his consulting firm received from the Brazilian company, Odebrecht [ODBES.UL], when he was a government minister more than a decade ago.
Kuczynski said the new impeachment motion unveiled by lawmakers this week makes Peru look ""ridiculous"" as it prepares to host the Summit of the Americas on April 13-14, a gathering of the region's leaders. 
""I'm going to defend myself and I won't resign because I haven't done anything"" wrong, Kuczynski told a crowd of supporters on Friday.
The new impeachment vote will be scheduled after Kuczynski speaks to a congressional investigative committee about his connections to Odebrecht on March 16.
Kuczynski's approval rating remained at 19 percent for a second straight month while disapproval of his presidency inched up to 76 percent, the Ipsos poll found.

The poll of 1,254 Peruvian adults was taken March 7-9 and had a 2.8 percentage point margin of error.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Conservative billionaire Sebastian Pinera vowed to combat economic ""stagnation"" from years of center-left rule as he started a new term as Chile's president on Sunday, calling for austerity and support for the shrinking middle class in one of Latin America's wealthiest nations.
After receiving the presidential sash from outgoing socialist President Michelle Bachelet, Pinera, who served as president for four years before Bachelet, promised to help eradicate poverty and transform Chile into a developed nation within a decade.
He said in a speech his government would perform ""major surgery"" on the public health care system while strengthening welfare programs and trading the country's ""bulldozer"" approach to policymaking for one based on gradual change and consensus.
""To make progress on all these goals, it is fundamental we counter the stagnation of recent years, restoring fiscal equilibrium as well as our leadership, dynamism and ability to grow,"" Pinera said in a speech from a balcony at the presidential palace in the capital Santiago.
Pinera, 68, was elected in December with a strong mandate, becoming the newest member of a group of conservative leaders who have risen to power in South America in recent years - all of whom attended his inauguration.
A Harvard-trained economist and the son of a prominent centrist politician, Pinera made his fortune introducing credit cards to Chile in the 1980s.
""The state must be austere and efficient in the use of public resources... and must never be captured by bureaucracy, corruption or political operators,"" Pinera said.
Pinera's incoming finance minister, Felipe Larrain, said he would rein in government spending this year, after Bachelet's government left a bigger-than-expected fiscal deficit of 2.1 percent of gross domestic product instead of 1.7 as targeted.
""Without a doubt, it's bad news,"" Larrain told journalists at the inauguration. ""We're going to have to get to work to examine and understand how this deficit increase happened.""
POPULAR OPPOSITION
As a candidate, Pinera said he would gradually balance the budget over six to eight years.
To revive growth in the world's top copper producer, incoming Mines Minister Baldo Prokurica said Pinera's government would seek to rescue $50 billion in mining investments from bureaucratic red tape.
But Pinera will have to govern with a divided Congress and a prickly leftist coalition that has vowed to fight his plans to lower taxes and ""correct"" Bachelet's progressive policies.
""The left may have lost the election, but I think they still feel like they own the streets, the popular opinion,"" said Kenneth Bunker, a Chilean political scientist. ""Pinera will feel that if he does anything too extreme, people will mobilize.""
But Pinera's timing is good. Rising copper prices have boosted Chile's exports, helping shore up government revenues and revive growth in the country's $250 billion economy.
While his 2010-2014 government was marred by street protests over rising inequality, Pinera started his new term by making several nods to progressive causes, from the need for pension reform to protections for nature and the environment.
In his first official activity as president, Pinera visited a children's center run by a state service that has been accused of improper care that contributed to the deaths of 1,300 children in the past decade.

""True development has a human face and its north is to improve the quality of life of Chileans,"" Pinera said.

The soldiers were deployed to the Moyale area of the country's Oromiya region in pursuit of Oromo Liberation Front fighters who had crossed into Ethiopia from three locations, the Ethiopian News Agency said.
""Nine civilians were killed and 12 others were injured during an operation that was launched with faulty intelligence,"" members of the armed forces told the agency.
Several soldiers have been suspended and are under investigation, it said, adding that a high-level military delegation had been dispatched to the area to launch an inquiry.
The Oromo Liberation Front is a secessionist group which the government has branded as terrorist.
The incident took place at a time when outbreaks of violence have continued to plague the country, mostly in Oromiya.
Last month, Addis Ababa imposed a six-month, nationwide state of emergency to tamp down unrest in Africa’s second most populous nation.
The move was made a day after Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn announced his resignation in what he said was a bid to smooth the way for reforms.
His replacement is expected to be named this month.

In a 2-hour documentary titled ""Putin"" and available on Russian social media, Putin told reporter Andrey Kondrashov he received a telephone call from security officers responsible for the Sochi Olympics on Feb. 7, 2014, shortly before the opening ceremony was due to start. 
""I was told: a plane en route from Ukraine to Istanbul was seized, captors demand landing in Sochi,"" Putin said in the film seen by Reuters. 
The pilots of a Turkish Pegasus Airlines Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 flying from Kharkiv to Istanbul reported that one of the passengers had a bomb and the plane had to change course to Sochi, Kondrashov said in the film.
There were 110 passengers onboard, while over 40,000 people had gathered at the stadium to watch the opening ceremony, the reporter said. 
Putin said he sought advice from security officers and was told the emergency plan for that type of situation called for the plane to be shot down. 
""I told them: act according to the plan,"" Putin said, adding that shortly afterwards he arrived at the Olympic venue with the International Olympic Committee officials. 
After several minutes Putin received another call, he said, informing him that it was a false alarm - the passenger was drunk and the plane would continue its flight to Turkey.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Sunday confirmed the comments in the film.
Putin runs for the presidency next Sunday, March 18.

The country is on a high alert ahead of the soccer World Cup from June 14 to July 15, with matches in a number of cities.

ISTANBUL/DUBAI (Reuters) - A wealthy Turkish socialite and her friends were among the 11 people killed on Sunday when a private plane bringing them home from a Dubai bachelorette party crashed into an Iranian mountainside. 
The plane was owned by the private holding company of Turkish businessman Huseyin Basaran, and carried eight passengers and three crew, an official for Turkey's transport ministry said. Those on board included Basaran's daughter Mina and seven of her friends, all flying back from a party ahead of her planned wedding next month.
Basaran, a former deputy chairman of Trabzonspor football club, owns businesses that span yachts to energy. One of his companies is the top shareholder in Bahrain Middle East Bank BSC, a small investment bank. His construction projects include a series of luxury apartment blocks on Istanbul's Asian side called ""Mina Towers"", named after his daughter.
The last photo on Mina Barasan's Instagram account showed her surrounded by seven other young women, all wearing robes and sunglasses. The post, tagged #minasbachelorette, said it was taken at the One and Only Royal Mirage luxury hotel in Dubai.
By late on Sunday evening, just a few hours after news of the crash, there were more than 7,000 comments on the photo.
""The wreck of the jet and the bodies are found. They will be carried down from the mountain when sun comes up. My condolences to those who lost their loved ones,"" the head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Kinik, said on Twitter, citing his Iranian sister organisation.
Kinik had earlier told Reuters there was ""no chance"" of any survivors, given the aircraft was a jet and it was flying in snowy weather, although he was unable to officially confirm fatalities.
Calls to Basaran Holding's office in Istanbul went unanswered.
Reza Jafarzadeh, spokesman for Iran's Civil Aviation Organization, told state television the jet had crashed near the southwestern city of Shahr-e Kord.
Local residents who had reached the site of the crash said there appeared to be no survivors and victims' bodies were burnt, ISNA news agency reported, quoting Mojtaba Khaledi, spokesman for Iran's emergency services.
ISNA earlier quoted emergency services as saying the wreckage was burning and was clearly visible.
Emergency crews had a difficult approach to reach the crash site because of the mountainous terrain, ISNA said.

1407,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2018 12:08PM ET</span>",Le Pen wants France's National Front to be renamed 'National Rally',"LILLE, France (Reuters) - French far-right leader Marine Le Pen proposed her National Front party be renamed the ""National Rally"" on Sunday, in a bid to shed a brand associated by many voters with racism and anti-Semitism and facilitate alliances with other parties.
Speaking at a party congress meant to help her reassert her authority following her defeat to President Emmanuel Macron last May, Le Pen said the party's priority should be to gain power, which could only be achieved through a coalition with allies.
""Our goal is clear: power,"" Le Pen told party cardholders gathered in the northern city of Lille, who cheered her speech denouncing immigration, globalization and a federal Europe. 
""We were originally a protest party,"" she said. ""There should be no doubt now that we can be a ruling party.""
The idea of changing the party's name was only approved by a narrow majority of National Front members, with 52 percent backing it on Saturday, according to figures provided by the party. They will get to vote again on the new name by post.
Jean-Marie Le Pen, the 89-year old far-right veteran who founded the party in 1972, called the name change political ""suicide"" in an interview with Reuters last month.
""The National Front name carries an epic and glorious history, which no-one should deny,"" Marine Le Pen said. ""But you know it is for many French people a psychological obstacle.""
In her speech, she slammed Macron's On The Move party as the embodiment of globalists cut off from France's roots. ""In Macron's France, to be on the move is to be a nomad. Just like migrants and tax evaders,"" she said.
Although she lost last year's election, Marine Le Pen's efforts to clean up the party's image have paid off to some extent. She won a third of the vote in the run-off, almost double her father's best showing in his 40 years at the party's helm.
She watered down her anti-euro stance, which has proved unpopular beyond the party's core fans, after the election, refocusing the party on migration and security as other far-right parties in Europe have done.
""Legal and illegal immigration are no longer bearable,"" she said to rousing applause.
Standing unopposed at this weekend's congress, she was reelected with 100 percent of the votes. 
Her strategy is also showing signs of tempting some in the conservative Republicans party to forge an alliance.
""The National Front has evolved, let's look at whether a deal is possible,"" Thierry Mariani, a former minister in Nicolas Sarkozy's government, told the Journal du Dimanche. That was quickly slapped down by the Republicans' spokeswoman.
However, it remains unclear whether rebranding the party will be enough to change its extremist image among the wider public.

In an Ifop poll published on Sunday, 63 percent of the French said the National Front would present a threat for democracy if it gained power.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A dispute within Israel's governing coalition over military conscription of ultra-orthodox Jewish men stirred speculation on Sunday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants to see a snap election to help him survive corruption investigations.
Right-wing and religious parties in the government are divided over the framing of a bill that would protect the exemption ultra-Orthodox men have traditionally enjoyed from compulsory military service. That has led to a series of urgent meetings between Netanyahu and his political partners.
After coalition talks on Sunday, Netanyahu's office said cabinet ministers were waiting for ultra-Orthodox parties, which control 13 of the government's 66 seats in the 120-member parliament, to present a revised formula for the legislation.
Secularist right-wing parties want the exemption lifted or at least the language changed. In the past the parties have compromised over the issue, but at least one coalition partner suggested Netanyahu was not invested in preventing the government's collapse.
""It is a fake crisis that can be resolved. It all depends on Netanyahu,"" Naftali Bennett, leader of the nationalist Jewish Home party that holds eight seats, told Israel Radio.
""If you bring down a right-wing government and lead us to unnecessary elections for personal aims, you will lose us,"" Bennett added on Twitter, apparently hinting at withdrawing future support for Netanyahu if the prime minister is indicted.
At least three police investigations revolving around bribery allegations threaten the four-term prime minister's political survival. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a witch hunt.
At a meeting with ministers of his Likud party on Sunday, Netanyahu was quoted by Israeli media as saying he was working for a stable government that would serve out its term until a national election due in November 2019.
Writing in the left-wing Haaretz newspaper, political commentator Yossi Verter spelled out a possible Netanyahu strategy.
""All the factors have converged to give the premier a one-time opportunity to go to an election and win, form a new government, and then, after he’s indicted, argue that the public made its choice knowing what the suspicions were, and therefore the accused can continue to manage his trial while also managing the country,"" Verter wrote.

Police have already recommended Netanyahu be charged in two corruption cases. Final word on whether to indict him rests with the attorney-general, a decision that could be months away. Recent opinion polls show public support for Netanyahu is still strong.

1409,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",Germany's new interior minister lays down law-and-order credentials,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's new interior minister will promote a law-and-order agenda that includes pushing for more video surveillance in public areas and faster deportations of rejected asylum seekers, he said in an interview.
Horst Seehofer, who heads Chancellor Angela Merkel's Bavarian allies the Christian Social Union (CSU), told Sunday newspaper Bild am Sonntag that Germany should remain an open and liberal country.
""But when it comes to protecting citizens, we need to have a strong state,"" he said.
""There must be a consensus ...that we no longer tolerate areas where the rule of law does not apply,"" he added, mentioning more video surveillance and faster processing of failed asylum applicants.
Seehofer takes office in a continuation of the grand coalition of Merkel's conservatives and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) that has governed Germany since 2013, which the SPD's rank and file approved last week - nearly half year after inconclusive national elections.
Merkel, Seehofer and SPD interim leader Olaf Scholz are expected to sign their coalition agreement on Monday and present their plans for the first 100 days.
Merkel and her bloc are keenly aware that voters expect the new government - which takes office on Wednesday - to address economic, social and security concerns, and Seehofer said the partners needed to quickly implement reforms and refrain from verbal attacks.
""The motto of the grand coalition now is working diligently instead of quarrelling industriously,"" he said.
But some fault lines have already emerged, with tensions over the sequencing and extent of reforms.
Seehofer is likely to clash on civil rights with the new SPD Justice Minister Katarina Barley while Merkel could end up arm-wrestling on fiscal spending and euro zone reforms with the new SPD Finance Minister Olaf Scholz.
The SPD could be emboldened by rising public support.
An Emid poll released on Sunday showed the party jumped 3 points on the week to 19 percent while Merkel's conservatives were unchanged at 33 percent.

The far right Alternative for Germany party, to which Merkel's bloc bled support in the September election, lost two points to 13 percent.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - France will commit 700 million euros to the International Solar Alliance (ISA), President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday at the founding conference of the organization, reiterating the European country's commitment to the alliance and clean energy.
ISA is an inter-governmental organization that aims to mobilize $1 trillion in funds for future solar generation, storage and technology across the world. It has 60 signatories, with 30 of those countries having ratified the agreement.
The treaty-based organization, launched by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015, aims to promote solar energy in 121 countries. 
Speaking at the conference, Macron said France was more than tripling its commitment to the alliance, and its total monetary contribution to the alliance stood at one billion euros.
Other than leaders from member countries, the event was attended by leaders from major development banks such as the Asian Development Bank and African Development Bank who are expected to sign solar energy-related agreements.The organization's main goal is to lower the cost of finance and spur investments across the supply chain, including in manufacturing, project development and storage, Upendra Tripathy, director general of ISA, told Reuters ahead of the conference on Friday.

Macron, traveling with a delegation of French companies including EDF (PA:EDF), Dassault Aviation, Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) and Suez, will inaugurate a solar plant built by Engie in Uttar Pradesh as a part of a four-day tour of India.

AL-MOKHA, Yemen (Reuters) - It took Seham Ali Ibrahim one month to make the dangerous journey from her village near the frontline town of al-Heiss to the relative safety of Yemen's western coast areas, often traveling by foot across battle lines.
Now, she lives in a straw hut with three other families, including nine children, outside al-Mokha where many displaced Yemenis have built makeshift shelters and rely on aid provided by humanitarian organizations and anti-Houthi coalition forces.
""We walked ... We rode donkeys and cars ... We made it to al-Mokha in a month,"" said the elderly Ibrahim, who does not know her exact age. 
Yemen has been devastated by three years of conflict in which President Abd-Rabu Mansour Hadi’s government, backed by the Saudi-led Arab coalition, is fighting to drive the Houthis out of cities they seized in a series of operations since 2014.
Al-Mokha, located some 75 kms (47 miles) north of the strategic Bab al-Mandab strait, and neighboring al-Khoukha and al-Heiss are among the few towns conceded by Houthi fighters since Yemen's civil war started in 2015 after the armed group forced Hadi into exile in Saudi Arabia.
""At least 40,000 have been displaced in recent weeks,"" Eshrak al-Soubai, Yemen’s deputy health minister, told Reuters.
""Most displaced people are coming from the areas of fighting in al-Heiss district (some 90 kms away) ... the situation is very critical,"" she said during a visit to al-Mokha hospital, the only medical facility in the coalition-controlled western coast.
Last month, the United Nations said at least 85,000 Yemenis had left their homes in the area since fresh fighting erupted in December 2017. 
Doctors and medical staff at al-Mokha hospital are struggling on a daily basis to provide aid and treatment for victims of the war and diseases.
Across Yemen, millions of civilians are trapped under heavy coalition air strikes, as well as a crackdown by the Houthis. Famine, cholera and diphtheria affect about eight million people, including two million severely malnourished children.
Haynam Salem, 40, lay in pain on an old examination table in a dusty room in the civilian wing of al-Mokha hospital after losing her five-month-old fetus shortly upon arriving in the town with her children from al-Hameli village in Taiz province. 
Plastic water bottles are being used as serum injection bags in the facility hit by shortages of medical supplies.
""The procedure to take the dead fetus out of her womb is not very complicated, but I am waiting to get some blood and I need at least two pounds,"" said Abderrahim al-Dhabi, a doctor working with the World Health Organization and the Arab coalition. “Hopefully, tomorrow I will get some.”
Nurses said the hospital lacks basic primary care, including a maternity doctor, and that they hadn't been paid for five months. 
“We asked the coalition for help, we asked international organizations but nobody seems to care,” said Maymouna Ali Ahmed, chief nurse in charge of maternity care at the facility.
FISHING RESTRICTED
Outside the hospital, sand storms swept the main unpaved street of the town, with thousands of used plastic bags covering the bushes and other desert vegetation. 
The local power plant has started to run again but is producing only five megawatts (MW), far below its capacity of 160 MW produced before the war. 
Displaced Yemenis are not the only ones relying on aid. 
Workers at the power plant said the managing director of the plant paid them in cash on a monthly basis, but that for the last year their pay had been slashed to 24,000 Yemeni riyals (around $40) down from 60,000 riyals. 
Fishing, the main source of income for the majority of local residents, remains subject to approval from coalition forces. Several fishermen told Reuters they were allowed to sail only once or twice a week.
A coalition commander said that sometimes fishermen were not allowed to venture out to sea “for security reasons”.

“At least the Houthis had no issue with our fishing boats,” one fisherman said, while he was waiting in a queue to collect aid distributed by the UAE Red Crescent.

The move is intended to increase effectiveness and accelerate the process of combating corruption, the statement quoted Attorney General Sheikh Saud al-Mujib as saying.
Saudi authorities detained hundreds of top businessmen and royals in November and held them for several months at the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton in a sweeping anti-corruption probe.
Most detainees have since been released after reaching financial settlements with the government, but several dozen others remain in custody and may stand trial.

Officials have not released the names of those still held, the allegations against them or plans for how the cases could be prosecuted.

The case is part of a widespread corruption crackdown in Communist party-ruled Vietnam that has now extended beyond the energy and banking sectors to provincial levels and the public security force.
Police issued an order for the arrest of Nguyen Thanh Hoa, 60, accused by prosecutors of organizing gambling, the ministry statement said, adding the move was part of an online gambling and money laundering case. 
""This is a particularly large scale case, using high technology, especially serious, complex and sensitive, involving many people, many sectors and provinces, involving officials within the police,"" State-run radio Voice of Vietnam news website cited the Party's secretariat as saying on Sunday.
Local state-controlled media VnExpress and Tuoi Tre News website said Hoa was a former head of the police's high-technology department. Hoa was also stripped off his ""people's police"" title by the nation's president on Sunday, the ministry said.
Vietnam's anti-graft push caught international attention last year when Germany accused the Southeast Asian nation of kidnapping a Vietnamese official from a Berlin park in scenes reminiscent of the Cold War. The man was eventually handed two life sentences for embezzlement. 
The crackdown has also resulted in a 13-year prison term for a former politburo member, Dinh La Thang, and a death sentence for a former chairman of state energy firm PetroVietnam. Dozens of other officials received jail terms.

The fighting, initially with about 50 members of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), broke out in a remote village in Datu Saudi Ampatuan town from Thursday morning and lasted the following day, said Lt. Col. Gerry Besana.
A soldier was slightly wounded, the army said in a separate statement.
The number of BIFF members killed and wounded was based on intelligence information, Besana said. The military did not recover any enemy bodies, he said.
Besana said the military launched artillery attacks with air support as the number of BIFF fighters had risen to about one hundred during the fighting.
The military classifies the BIFF, which it said has about 300 members, as a terrorist organization, along with the Abu Sayyaf and Maute groups.
""Seventy were killed and injured (on the BIFF side), we are still pursuing about 200 more,"" Besana said, adding that the clash had displaced about 500 families.
The militants in southern Philippines were regrouping, retraining and recruiting new members for another attack elsewhere after occupying the southern city of Marawi for five months last year, according to the army.

1415,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2018 11:03AM ET</span>",Hundreds urged to wash clothes after UK nerve agent attack,"By Henry Nicholls
SALISBURY, England (Reuters) - Hundreds of people who visited the Zizzi restaurant or the Mill pub in the English city of Salisbury were told on Sunday to wash their clothes after traces of nerve agent used to attack a former Russian spy last week were found at both sites. 
Public Health England said there was no immediate health risk to anyone who may have been in either the restaurant or the pub, but their was a small chance that any of the agent that had come into contact with clothing or belongings could still be present in minute amounts and contaminate skin.
Former double agent Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, have been in hospital in a critical condition since March 4, when they were found unconscious on a bench in the southern English cathedral city of Salisbury.
""We have now learned there has been some trace contamination by the nerve agent in both the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury,"" chief medical offer Sally Davies said on Sunday.
She said she was confident that no one who was in the restaurant or the pub on March 4 or 5 had been harmed, but their clothing should be washed and personal items like phones wiped as a precaution against any long-term exposure to any substance.
Skripal and his daughter remained in a ""critical but stable condition in intensive care,"" the chief executive of the local hospital said at a news conference.
A police officer who initially responded was ""conscious and in a serious but stable condition,"" she added.
British police have said a nerve agent was used against Skripal and his daughter, but have not made public which one. 
SMALL RISK
Public Health England said it had weighed new evidence before issuing its advice on Sunday, and it said the general public had not been at risk in the days since the attack.
""This is about a very, very small risk of repetitive contact for any traces of contamination that people may have taken out,"" Public Health England's deputy medical director Jenny Harries said at the same press conference.
""In risk terms one or two days is not what we are concerned about, what we are worrying about is whether there could be an ongoing risk that could build over the future.""
Many in British media and politics have speculated that Russia could have played a part in the attack on Skripal, but interior minister Amber Rudd said on Saturday it was too early to say who was responsible.
Skripal betrayed dozens of Russian agents to British intelligence before his arrest in Moscow in 2004. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006, and in 2010 was given refuge in Britain after being exchanged for Russian spies.
Finance minister Philip Hammond said Britain would respond ""appropriately"" if a foreign state is found to have been involved in the poisoning. 
""This is a police investigation and it will be evidence-led and we must go where the evidence takes us,"" Hammond told BBC television on Sunday.

""So we have to allow the police investigation to run its course. But if there were to be an involvement of a foreign state evidenced by this investigation, then obviously that would be very serious indeed and the government would respond appropriately,"" he said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Two senior South Korean officials who met with North Korea's Kim Jong Un last week will split up to visit the leaders of China and Japan this week to update them on the talks, a South Korean presidential official said on Sunday.
Blue House spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said in a mobile message that National Security Office head Chung Eui-yong will meet with China's Xi Jinping on Monday, while spy agency chief Suh Hoon, accompanied by one of Chung's deputies Nam Gwan-pyo, will speak with Japan's Shinzo Abe on Tuesday.
Chung and Suh will leave for China and Japan separately on Monday to discuss their visit to North Korea with officials there. Chung is also scheduled to visit Russia after his trip to Beijing, but the details of that have yet to be announced. 
The two officials returned on Sunday from a visit to the United States where an invitation from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for dialogue on his nuclear program was delivered to U.S. President Donald Trump.
Trump agreed to meet with Kim and the two are expected to have the meeting some time before the end of May, although a time and place has not been set.
A Blue House official told reporters earlier on Sunday the truce village of Panmunjom at the inter-Korean border is a strong candidate for the U.S.-North Korea summit. Kim will meet with South Korean President Moon Jae-in at Panmunjom before the end of April for the first inter-Korean summit in more than a decade. 
Other locations being floated in the media for the meeting between Trump and Kim include Switzerland, Sweden and the South Korean resort island of Jeju. 
Officials from North Korea and the United States will speak directly with each other, while South Korea will be asked to consult with both, the South Korean official said.
Trump said on Saturday his planned meeting with Kim Jong Un could end quickly without an agreement or could result in ""the greatest deal for the world"" to ease nuclear tensions between the two countries.

""I may leave fast"" if progress does not seem possible, Trump said at a campaign rally for Republican congressional candidate Rick Saccone in western Pennsylvania. Trump said he believed North Korea wanted to make peace and that: ""I think it's time.""

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African gold producers will likely reach a settlement within six weeks in a lawsuit over a fatal lung disease that companies have set aside 5 billion rand ($420 million) in provisions for, a lawyer and industry group said on Sunday.
""I am confident we will finalize the settlement within six weeks,"" Richard Spoor, the human rights lawyer who has spearheaded the class action suit over the disease silicosis, which gold miners contract while working underground, told Reuters. 
A spokesman for the working group on Occupational Lung Disease (OLD), a group put together by the six companies involved, said it was is ""hopeful"" the settlement can be reached in that timeframe.
The settlement would still need to be approved by a High Court before it was implemented.
In February, Graham Briggs, the chair of the working group, said the settlement was seen within ""months"". On top of the 5 billion rand that companies have made in provisions, there is 4 billion rand available from a compensation fund to which the industry has been contributing for years.
The suit was launched around six years ago on behalf of miners suffering from silicosis, contracted by inhaling silica dust in gold mines.
Almost all of the claimants are black miners from South Africa and neighboring countries such as Lesotho, whom critics say were not provided with adequate protection during and even after apartheid rule ended in 1994.
The six companies involved are  Harmony  Gold (J:HARJ), Gold Fields (J:GFIJ), African Rainbow Minerals (J:ARIJ), Sibanye-Stillwater (J:SGLJ), AngloGold Ashanti (J:ANGJ) and  Anglo American  (L:AAL).
Anglo American no longer has gold assets but historically was a bullion producer.

State television on Sunday broadcast from the eastern Ghouta town of Mudeira, which state television and a war monitor said the army had captured to link up with units on the other side of the enclave. 
A military media unit run by the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, an ally of the Syrian government, said the army had also entirely surrounded the town of Douma. 
Footage showed several massive plumes of smoke in the distance behind a war-ravaged townscape with big holes in walls and roofs, and yet more smoke wafting across the streets. The sound of blasts could be heard.
More than 1,100 civilians have been killed in the onslaught on the biggest rebel stronghold near Damascus since it began three weeks ago with a withering bombardment, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
It said there was intense fighting on several fronts accompanied by a government artillery barrage, continuous air raids and attacks by helicopters. 
The advance on Mudeira, after the capture of the neighboring town of Mesraba on Saturday, has driven a wedge deep inside the insurgent territory, leaving the major towns of Douma and Harasta cut off. 
Rebel groups in eastern Ghouta have vowed they will fight on. A statement issued by Free Syrian Army factions there late on Saturday said they had taken a decision not to accept a surrender and negotiated withdrawal. 
After the army advances split up the enclave, Jaish al-Islam emerged as the strongest group in the town of Douma, Ahrar al-Sham in the town of Harasta and Failaq al-Rahman in the new southern pocket of eastern Ghouta. 
Syrian state media also reported army advances near Jisreen and Aftaris in the southeastern part of the rebel-held territory.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his ally Russia see the rebels as terrorist groups, and say their offensive is needed to end the rebels' rule over eastern Ghouta's large population. 
But the violence of their assault has prompted condemnation from Western countries and repeated calls by United Nations aid agencies for a humanitarian ceasefire. 
Activists and fighters in eastern Ghouta in recent days have said the bombardment has included incendiary material that causes fires and burn injuries. Local doctors have also reported several incidents of bomb attacks followed by the smell of chlorine and choking symptoms. 
The government denies using either incendiary weapons or chlorine gas bombs, and said on Saturday it had information that the rebels were planning to stage a fake chemical attack to discredit the army. 
GUNFIRE 
In Muscat, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it would be ""very unwise"" for Syrian government forces to use weaponized gas, citing unconfirmed reports of chlorine attacks in eastern Ghouta.
Visiting Oman, Mattis stopped short of threatening to retaliate against Syrian forces if a chlorine attack were confirmed. But he noted America's cruise missile strike on April 6, 2017, on a Syrian air base over a sarin gas attack and said President Donald Trump had ""full political maneuver room"" to take whatever decision he believed was appropriate.
While the government and Russia say they have set up safe routes into government-held territory, no civilians are known to have crossed through them yet. 
Damascus and Moscow accuse rebels of firing on anybody who tries to leave, something the insurgents deny though a Reuters witness said there was shelling and gunfire near one exit route on Friday. 
Rebels and some eastern Ghouta residents contacted by Reuters have said people there do not want to come back under Assad's rule for fear of persecution, an idea the government says is groundless. 
On Saturday, the army found 60 civilians cowering in a basement in Mesraba. Activists in eastern Ghouta said thousands of people from Mesraba had already fled into Douma, further into the rebel territory, before the army took it. 
Syrian state television reported on Sunday that rebel mortar fire had killed four people after hitting a taxi. Assad has sworn to end insurgent shelling of the capital. 
Defeat in eastern Ghouta would deliver the rebels their biggest blow since December 2016, when a government offensive drove them from Aleppo, their largest urban stronghold. 
Backed by Russian war planes and other military assistance since 2015, Assad has gained momentum on several fronts across the country, driving rebels from numerous pockets and recapturing swathes of the east from Islamic State. 
But he is still far from regaining control over the entire country. Rebel groups hold large areas of the northwest and southwest, while northeastern Syria is in the hands of Kurdish fighters and allied militias. 

Meanwhile, the increasingly global nature of the war means that military attempts to regain several of those areas could pit Assad and his Russian and Iranian backers against forces that are also directly supported by powerful foreign countries.

The strikes, carried out on Saturday and Sunday, targeted the Hakurk, Zap, Metina, Gara and Avasin-Basyan regions of northern Iraq, Anadolu said, citing the Turkish military.
Turkey regularly carries out airstrikes against PKK targets in northern Iraq, where the group is based in the Qandil mountains.
The PKK, considered a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union and Turkey, has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast that has killed some 40,000 people.
Turkey in January launched a separate military operation in northern Syria's Afrin region to sweep Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters from its southern border. Turkey considers the YPG an extension of the PKK.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his ally, Finance Minister Taro Aso, face mounting pressure over a suspected cronyism scandal as the finance ministry prepares to report on Monday that documents in the case were doctored.
Abe, now in his sixth year in office, had hoped to put the issue of the sale of state-owned land at a huge discount to a school operator with ties to his wife, Akie, behind him. But it has gathered steam with a series of fresh revelations.
A source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Saturday the finance ministry planned to report to parliament on Monday that it had found instances where content was deleted from documents submitted to lawmakers. The source spoke on condition of anonymity. 
""If this is true, isn't political responsibility unavoidable?"" Akira Nagatsuma, a senior lawmaker in the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, told reporters on Sunday.
Abe has repeatedly denied he or his wife did favors for school operator Moritomo Gakuen, which bought the land, and has said he would resign if evidence were found that they had. The issue last year sharply eroded Abe's popularity.
Former Moritomo Gakuen head Yasunori Kagoike and his wife were arrested in July on suspicion of illegally receiving subsidies.
On Friday, National Tax Agency chief Nobuhisa Sagawa abruptly resigned over his remarks in parliament about the case. 
Also on Friday, media said police were investigating as possible suicide the death of a finance ministry official whose local office had handled the land sale. 
""If Minister Aso signed off on National Tax Agency chief Sagawa's resignation knowing about the falsified documents, moves seeking his resignation are inevitable,"" Yuichiro Tamaki, leader of the opposition Democratic Party, told reporters.
Suspicions of an attempted cover-up could slash Abe's ratings and dash his hopes of a third term as ruling Liberal Democratic Party leader. Victory in the LDP September leadership vote would put him on track to become Japan's longest-serving premier.
""CRITICAL BLOW""
""If Aso were forced out, it would be a critical blow to the prime minister, reinforcing the impression of a cover-up and depriving Abe of a key ally who has served as finance minister since December 2012,"" wrote Tobias Harris, vice president of consultancy Teneo Intelligence in an email report.
Sagawa headed the ministry division that submitted the documents before he was tapped as tax agency chief in July, an appointment critics saw as a reward for his efforts to diffuse the issue with his statements to parliament last year.
Aso and Abe have both defended the appointment as ""appropriate"" and Aso has said he will not resign.
""If these documents were falsified, the entire cabinet should resign,"" tweeted Mizuho Fukushima, a lawmaker with the tiny opposition Social Democratic Party.
Abe, 63, swept back to power in December 2012 promising to revive the economy and bolster its defense.
It was a rare comeback for the conservative lawmaker, who quit abruptly in 2007 after a year in office marked by scandals in his cabinet, a deadlocked parliament and ill health. 
His ruling bloc won a two-thirds ""super majority"" in a October lower house poll, helped by opposition disarray.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cubans went to the polls on Sunday in a one-party vote, the last step before a new president is selected next month, as the Communist-ruled island prepares to be led for the first time since the 1959 revolution by someone whose last name is not Castro.
Cubans are asked to endorse two official lists of candidates for the national and provincial assemblies. The government depicts the vote, which takes place every five years, as a symbolic show of unity in the face of U.S. hostility. 
This year, though, the new national assembly will select a president to replace 86-year-old Raul Castro on April 19. Starting with Raul's late older brother Fidel, the Castros have ruled the Caribbean island for nearly six decades.
Leaders of the Cuban exile community in the United States, including Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, have called on President Donald Trump not to recognize the election results, saying the process is a fraud designed to legitimize a dictatorship.
Raul Castro voted with little fanfare at dawn in the foothills of the Sierra Maestra mountains in southeast Cuba, where he had led a group of guerillas during the revolution.
Castro, who succeeded his brother as president in 2008, is expected to remain at the helm of the powerful Communist Party while First Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel, 57, is expected to become president.
Diaz-Canel, a party functionary since his youth, would be Cuba's first modern head of state who was born after the revolution and has no military history.
In central Villa Clara province, where Diaz-Canel grew up and was head of the Communist Party, the candidate and his wife voted alongside local residents, smiling and chatting with them.
He told reporters the election signaled that Cubans wanted to defend their independence, and criticized the Trump administration for undermining a fragile detente established under former U.S. President Barack Obama.
""Relations with the United States have been deteriorating ... due to an administration that has offended Cuba, strengthened the blockade against Cuba, returned to the rhetoric of the Cold War and adopted measures that offends and harms millions of Cubans and North Americans,"" Diaz-Canel said after casting his ballot.
But Rafael Hernandez, one of Cuba's leading political analysts and editor of the magazine Temas, said if Diaz-Canel becomes president, he will not have the same moral authority as the ""historic generation"" of revolutionary leaders. He will have to establish his legitimacy by addressing voters' concerns and raising living standards.
The task will be more challenging at a time when aid from ally Venezuela has fallen, relations with the United States have deteriorated, and efforts to modernize the economy and introduce market reforms have dragged due to what the government admits is a lack of preparedness.
""For many Cubans, elections have never represented change,"" said Rafael Padron, 37, a personal sports trainer in Havana. ""But this is a key moment.""
More than eight million Cubans are eligible to vote and turnout is traditionally around 85 percent.
While candidates on the slates are not required to belong to the Communist Party, the only legal party in Cuba, most do. 
The parliamentary candidates, selected by party-controlled commissions, include Raul Castro and two men who fought with him in the mountains during the revolution: Vice presidents Jose Ramon Machado Ventura, 87, and Ramiro Valdes, 85.
Castro has said he will step down as president at the end of his second five-year term in April, but will continue as a National Assembly deputy. Many analysts expect his fellow revolutionaries to retire from the government, marking a generational shift.

""We don't know what will happen exactly,"" said Arnaldo Betancourt, 52, who sells handicrafts in Havana, ""but people want to see new things, a change for the better.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Polling kicked off across Hong Kong in crucial by-elections on Sunday, with opposition democrats urging the city's 2.1 million eligible voters to cast ""protest"" ballots against perceived meddling from China's Communist Party rulers.
The by-elections will fill four legislative council seats once held by pro-democracy lawmakers who were ousted from public office after authorities deemed they'd failed to take valid oaths of office. Critics slammed the move as politically motivated to weaken the opposition.
Sunday's polls also coincided with a vote in Beijing's parliament which is expected to remove the Chinese president's term limits, setting the stage for President Xi Jinping to stay in office indefinitely.
The news has stoked some unease in Hong Kong, worrying about its long-term implications given Xi's relative tough line on the freewheeling Asian financial hub.
""[Xi Jinping] just wants to be an emperor himself. Nobody would believe such a person would do any good for Hong Kong,"" said voter Sophia Yiu, 23, who said she flew back to town from Australia just to vote.
During a visit to Hong Kong last July, Xi warned Beijing won't tolerate any challenge to its authority.
Prior to Sunday's polls, several democracy activists including Agnes Chow were barred from running, drawing some international criticism, including from the European Union.
The opposition has been hobbled in the 70-member legislature, having lost its power to veto most legislation, with pro-establishment and pro-Beijing parties now dominating.
Some democrats in the city of 7.3 million say these polls are crucial to redress the injustice of the disqualifications, and to prevent the council becoming a rubber-stamp parliament, like the National People's Congress in Beijing.
""This is a protest vote, a war on public opinion and a de facto referendum. It will show if Hong Kong people agree or disagree with the disqualifications,"" said 21-year-old student democracy activist Joshua Wong.
""Hong Kong's system no longer has checks and balances and the rule of law we knew of has already become rule by law.""
Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam voted at a school in the exclusive Peak district but declined to speak with reporters as a small group of protesters scuffled with police nearby.
A former Hong Kong leader, Tung Chee-Hwa, said the elections were important as Hong Kong was at a ""critical juncture"".
""The time for squabbling should be over,"" he said, calling on voters to back those who are ""constructive, practical and truly want to serve Hong Kong.""
Fifteen candidates are running for four seats, though the results are hard to predict amid a subdued mood with early voter turnout on the low side, according to government figures.
""(The disqualifications) were definitely wrong,"" said one voter, 60-year-old Cheng Siu-ngor. ""I hope after this time, more young people can rise up.""
After more than a century of British colonial rule, Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula which guarantees it a high degree of autonomy and the promise of eventual universal suffrage.
Over the past two decades however, tensions have simmered and occasionally boiled over with activists pushing in vain for full democracy amidst opposition from Beijing.

Since the massive street protests of late 2014 that blocked major roads for 79 days, critics say authorities have sought to suppress and demoralize a younger generation of activists -- some of whom were jailed and face lawsuits.

The center-right Progressive Conservatives, which have been leading in polls to unseat the ruling Liberals, elected Doug Ford after a chaotic day of vote counting which saw the result delayed by several hours.
Fifty-three year old Ford is the brother of late Rob Ford, the former mayor of Toronto who gained global notoriety for admitting to smoking crack cocaine while in office. 
The party was thrown into chaos in January after party leader Patrick Brown resigned following accusations of sexual misconduct. Brown has denied the allegations.
Ford, a former Toronto city councillor, will have to unify the party and spearhead a campaign to oust Ontario's 14-year-old Liberal government, led by Premier Kathleen Wynne. 
""Tonight we took the first step in defeating Kathleen Wynne,"" Ford told reporters. ""To the people of Ontario, I say relief is on its way."" 
The run-up to Saturday's election was marred by several hiccups, including troubles with voter registration and a failed last-minute attempt by Brown to re-enter the leadership race.

""We have a lot of work to do... in a very short amount of time,"" Ford said after winning the four-cornered contest. Ford defeated his nearest rival Christine Elliott, who lost the 2015 party chief race to Brown.

The explosion appeared to have been triggered from a distance and may have been made by someone with knowledge of mining materials, according to Mexican newspaper El Universal, citing an investigation conducted by the Mexican attorney general's office and the marine secretary.
A spokesman for the attorney general's office did not respond to a request for comment.
The explosion on a ferry docked at a Playa del Carmen pier injured at least 25, including U.S. tourists.
Shortly before spring break, when thousands of U.S. college students descend on Mexican beach towns, the U.S. government on Wednesday barred its employees from traveling to Playa del Carmen, citing an unspecified ""security threat"" and mentioning the blast.
On Friday, the U.S. government updated the ban, limiting it to certain neighborhoods in Playa del Carmen. The U.S. State Department advises tourists to exercise ""increased caution"" in the state of Quintana Roo. 
Local media reported that the ferry was operated by Barcos Caribe, which is owned by the family of former Quintana Roo governor Roberto Borge, who was extradited from Panama to Mexico in January to face corruption charges. 
Barcos Caribe did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
No motive for the explosion has been suggested yet, and both federal and state officials are still investigating. 
Playa del Carmen is located about 46 miles (76 km) south of Cancun, the centerpiece of a strip of white sand beaches that is one of Latin America's top tourist destinations.
In recent years, Mexican tourist destinations have been tainted by the country's long-running battle against drug cartels. Murder rates have soared in both Pacific resort Acapulco and Los Cabos, a popular stretch of beaches and desert on the southern tip of Baja California.

1426,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2018 05:33PM ET</span>",UK police identify over 200 witnesses in nerve agent attack: minister,"By Peter Nicholls
SALISBURY, England (Reuters) - British police have identified more than 200 witnesses and are looking at more than 240 pieces of evidence in their investigation into a nerve agent attack on a Russian ex-spy and his daughter, interior minister Amber Rudd said on Saturday.
Former double agent Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, have been in hospital in a critical condition since Sunday, when they were found unconscious on a bench in the southern English cathedral city of Salisbury.
""The two victims remain in hospital and they're critical but stable,"" Rudd told reporters after chairing a meeting of the government's Cobra security committee.
Skripal betrayed dozens of Russian agents to British intelligence before his arrest in Moscow in 2004. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006, and in 2010 was given refuge in Britain after being exchanged for Russian spies.
Many in British media and politics have speculated that Russia could have played a part in the attack on Skripal, but Rudd reiterated that it was too early to say who was responsible, and police should be given the time and space to determine the facts.
The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the incident and accused the British media of whipping up anti-Russian hysteria.
In Salisbury, normally a quiet city, military vehicles and troops in protective suits and gas masks were seen working at several of the sites associated with the Skripal investigation.
At an ambulance station a short distance from the city centre, troops in light grey overalls, purple gloves and gas masks covered ambulances with black tarpaulins as they prepared to remove them.
At the hospital where the Skripals were being treated another team used an army truck to remove a police car.
TRACES OF NERVE AGENT
The BBC reported late on Saturday that traces of the nerve agent had been found at Zizzi, an Italian restaurant where the Skripals had a meal before they were found unconscious. A police spokesman declined to comment on the report.
The restaurant, which has been closed to the public since Sunday, was one of the sites being investigated by forensic teams. The BBC, without citing a source, reported that the authorities did not think anyone else who had been there was at risk from the nerve agent.
Rudd said that Nick Bailey, a police officer who became unwell after taking part in the early response to the attack, remained seriously ill but was talking and engaging with his family.
Wiltshire Police, the local force, issued a statement on Bailey's behalf in which he thanked the public for messages of support he had received.
""He does not consider himself a ‘hero’, he states he was merely doing his job,"" the statement said.
Rudd said more than 250 counter terrorism police, from eight out of Britain's 11 specialist units, were involved in the investigation, which was proceeding with ""speed and professionalism"".
The military have been providing support since Friday and Rudd said the police would continue to be given all the resources they needed to conduct the investigation.
There was also a flurry of activity at the cemetery in Salisbury where Skripal's wife and son are buried, with forensic teams active in several parts of the site.
Skripal's son, Alexander, died in July last year at the age of 43. British media reported that he died while in St Petersburg, Russia. Skripal's wife, Liudmila, died of cancer at 60, in 2012.
British police have previously said they knew which exact nerve agent was used against Skripal and his daughter, but they have not made that information public.
The attack has been likened to the assassination of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, a critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who died in London in 2006 after drinking green tea laced with radioactive polonium-210.

A British public inquiry found that Putin had probably ordered Litvinenko's murder. Britain has named two Russian suspects but Russia has refused to extradite them.

Tens of thousands of Bolivians held the so-called ""flag of maritime revindication,"" which stretched like a long ribbon along a highway in the Andes between the towns Oruro and Apacheta, on the outskirts of La Paz.
The display of patriotism aims to cheer on Bolivia's legal team ahead of oral arguments it will deliver at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) regarding the country's claim to sovereign access to Chile's Pacific coast.
Bolivia lost its access to the Pacific Ocean in a late 19th century war with Chile, but maintains a navy and wants a corridor to the sea to boost its exports of natural gas and minerals.
""We'll show the International Court of Justice and all people on the planet that our cause is just, reasonable and sound,"" President Evo Morales said after flying over the flag in a helicopter.
Morales has faced street protests in recent months over his plan to seek a fourth presidential term next year, after a court eliminated term limits last year.

Bolivia and Chile will start nine days of oral arguments before the ICJ on March 19.

Ex-foreign minister Samura Kamara of the ruling All People's Congress and rival Julius Maada Bio, a former junta leader and candidate of the Sierra Leone People's Party, each had about 43 percent of the ballots cast in Wednesday's poll. Kamara was about 1,500 votes ahead.
The other two main candidates -- Kandeh Yumkella, a former United Nations Under-Secretary, and Samuel Sam-Sumana -- got 6.7 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively. There were 12 other minor candidates.
President Ernest Bai Koroma is stepping aside after his maximum two terms in office and the vote to replace him has largely been peaceful, a triumph for a country that lived through a brutal, diamond-fueled civil war in the 1990s.

But the winner faces a huge task trying to kick start the West African country's economy, which after recovering from the war has been ravaged by low prices for iron ore, its main export, and an Ebola epidemic.

The champion of Donald Trump's ""America First"" agenda, who was invited to speak at the National Front party congress in northern France by Marine Le Pen, spoke only about her 28-year old niece at their joint press conference.
""She is not simply a rising star on the right in France. She's one of the most impressive people in the entire world,"" Bannon, an American nationalist who ran the right-wing Breitbart News, told reporters, without mentioning his host Marine Le Pen.
Bannon met Marion, who temporarily withdrew from politics after her aunt's presidential election defeat last May, at the CPAC conservative conference in Maryland last month, where he said she was ""absolutely electrifying."" [nL8N1QA2R5]
Marion's U.S. speech was widely commented on in French media as posing a challenge for Marine Le Pen.
Asked by reporters how she felt about Bannon's comments, Marine Le Pen turned to the American and said that journalists were trying to stir up competition between the two women.
""They don't understand that we defend the same ideas, in the education field for her and in politics for me,"" she said.
""They're asking me how I feel about the good things you said about Marion, to which I reply: they make me glad.""
Bannon then quipped: ""We call that fake news.""
Marine Le Pen was hoping that the National Front congress in Lille would help her reassert her authority, after her defeat to pro-Europe centrist Emmanuel Macron prompted criticism of her style and policies.
Marion Marechal-Le Pen, a former lawmaker, is more socially conservative and economically liberal than her aunt. She was not present at the congress in Lille on Saturday, having said she is now working on an education project.
Addressing the FN congress earlier, Bannon was given a standing ovation, as he told party members history was on their side and would eventually lead them to victory.
""What I've learned is that you're part of a worldwide movement that's bigger than France, bigger than Italy, bigger than Hungary, bigger than all of us,"" he said.
""I did not come here as a teacher, I came here to Europe as an observer and to learn,"" he added, pointing at recent elections in Italy as a sign of a rising populist wave.

Bannon was fired by the White House last August, though he continued to speak with Trump and tried to promote the president's agenda.

The Israeli military said soldiers arrived at the scene and ""used riot dispersal means and fired live rounds.""

DUBLIN (Reuters) - At least 10,000 people rallied in Dublin on Saturday against Irish government plans to ease some of the world's most restrictive abortion laws, with some activists saying opinion polls were failing to fully reflect anti-abortion sentiment. 
Voters will be asked as soon as May if they wish to repeal the eighth amendment to Ireland's constitution - inserted in 1983 to enshrine the equal right to life of the mother and her unborn child - and instead enable parliament to set the laws.
The government has said it will begin drafting legislation in line with the recommendations made by an all-party parliamentary committee for terminations with no restrictions to be allowed up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy.
In the largest protest of the campaign so far, a march over one kilometer long snaked across the capital, with protesters chanting ""pro-life"" and ""Repeal kills"" and a few holding up pictures of aborted fetuses. Irish state broadcaster RTE estimated that tens of thousands took part. 
""If the eighth amendment is repealed it will destroy Ireland,"" said John O'Leary, an unemployed 50-year-old holding a banner of Saint Patrick, Ireland's patron saint. 
Abortion has long been a divisive issue in once stridently Catholic Ireland where a complete ban was lifted only in 2013 when terminations were allowed in cases where the mother's life was in danger. 
Two opinion polls in January found that over 50 percent of voters would support a proposal to allow abortion up to 12 weeks into a pregnancy, with just under 30 percent opposed and the rest undecided.
However, the polls showed a sharp generational divide with a clear majority of voters over 65 opposed.
""I am canvassing three times a week and people are pro-life, they are just afraid to say it,"" said Deirdre Lawless, 32, a schoolteacher from the rural west of Ireland.
A number of activists complained of what they believed was a strong media bias in favor of loosening abortion laws. But they also said that the pro-choice movement may be overconfident. 
""We will win because of the hubris of the other side,"" said Gerry McGeough, 59, a member of the Catholic Irish nationalist group Ancient Order of Hibernians who traveled down with several busloads of activists from the Northern Ireland county of Tyrone. ""Traditional Ireland has finally awoken,"" he said.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Hundreds of women took to the streets in the Tunisian capital on Saturday to demand equal inheritance rights as men, a subject often seen as taboo in the Arab world.
The North African Muslim country grants women more rights than other countries in the region, and since last year has allowed Muslim women to marry non-Muslim men.
But the protestors marching to the parliament building in Tunis on Saturday said they wanted to be compared with European women and to be entitled to the same inheritance rights.
Joined by some men, they carried slogans such as ""In a civil state I take exactly what you take"", demanding an end to inheritance laws based on Islamic law. This usually grants men the double of what women get.
""It is true that Tunisian women have more rights compared to other Arab women but we want to be compared with European women,"" said Kaouther Boulila, an activist. 
""We just want our rights.""
In August, President Beji Caid Essbsi, a secular politician, set up a committee to draft proposals to advance women's rights.
Tunisia has been hailed as the only ""Arab spring"" success story following political freedoms introduced after the ousting of autocrat Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011.

Economic growth has been disappointing, however, with high unemployment driving many young Tunisians who had joined the uprising, abroad.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania's ruling Social Democrats (PSD), in power for a year, voted at an extraordinary congress on Saturday to back a 2024 target date to adopt the euro currency.
PSD leader Liviu Dragnea told a 4,000-strong gathering that joining the euro zone was a mandatory and natural step for Romania - one the fastest growing economies in the European Union but still one of its poorest and most corrupt members.
""We have to look with courage and understand this is a mandatory step and the only chance for Romania to sit at the table of the rich in Europe,"" Dragnea said. ""This is a project of national solidarity.""
Romania, a country of about 21 million, had originally set a 2014 target to adopt the single currency, later pushed to 2019. But these dates proved unrealistic given scant progress meeting EU targets for its economy and institutions to catch up with those of richer countries.
Its economy has grown robustly in recent years, expanding by 6.9 percent in the fourth quarter, with domestic consumption jumping by 9.3 percent, boosted by wage and pension hikes.
Dragnea, who retains a tight grip over the party and is seen as effectively in charge of the government, said the cabinet will approve ""a national commission to substantiate the euro adoption plan later in March,"" and that nationwide debates on it are expected to begin next month.
""I want to offer the entire society political consensus on December 1 to set the timetable for joining the eurozone,"" he said. 
Infrastructure would be a top priority, he added, with motorways set to connect Romania to the capitals of all neighboring states.
Dragnea has been barred from becoming prime minister despite the party's sweeping election win in December 2016 because of a prior conviction in a vote-rigging case.
He is also on trial in an abuse of office case and faces a separate inquiry on suspicion of forming a criminal group to siphon off cash from state projects. He has denied all charges.

The congress was also expected to vote to name Prime Minister Viorica Dancila - a close ally of Dragnea - the second-ranking party official.

ABOARD AQUARIUS RESCUE SHIP (Reuters) - International charity ships and Libya's coastguard and picked up several hundred migrants on Saturday as smugglers trying to take advantage of calm seas launched a flurry of boats towards Italy.
Libyan coastguard vessels intercepted two of the migrant boats, the first an inflatable dinghy that had broken down with 125 people on board off Zawiya, just west of the capital, Tripoli, said Ayoub Qassem, a coastguard spokesman.
The second boat was turned back off Garabulli, east of Tripoli, and had 112 people on board.
One boat with more than 100 migrants on board made it as far as the Aquarius rescue ship about 21 miles from the coast to the west of Tripoli. The ship was preparing to transfer the migrants to Italy.
Rescuers on board the Aquarius said the migrant boat was on the verge of completely sinking when it reached them. More than half the migrants on it were Nigerians, with the rest from other sub-Saharan African countries as well as two Palestinians.
""All but one of the five balloons holding the boat up was either completely deflated or deflating and there were still about 120 people inside the boat, so a very, very precarious condition,"" said one of the rescuers, Max Avis. 
A Reuters reporter saw one of the Palestinians being thrown into the water by other migrants after trying to convince them that they would be better off being saved by a nearby Libyan coastguard boat than drowning.
Libya is the main departure point for migrants attempting to reach Europe by sea. More than 600,000 migrants have crossed the central Mediterranean to Italy over the past four years as people smugglers took advantage of a security vacuum in Libya. Thousands more perished at sea.
Since last summer the rate of departures dropped sharply after smugglers in the Libyan town of Sabratha struck a deal with the Tripoli government to halt their activities and were then pushed from the town by rival armed groups.
Libya's EU-backed coastguard has also stepped up interceptions, often cutting migrant boats off before they can reach international vessels that would bring them to Europe.
Two other groups of migrants were being transferred to the Aquarius late on Saturday, one from a merchant ship and the other from another charity vessel.
Meanwhile the coastguard in Zuwara, a former Libyan smuggling hub west of Zawiya, said they had foiled a departure during the night and arrested some migrants whilst others had escaped with smugglers.

The coastguard posted pictures of detained sub-Saharan African migrants sitting in an inflatable rubber boat on the beach in the dark.

Turkey and allied Syrian rebel groups it supports are advancing on the town from the east under intense bombardment, the Britain-based Observatory said.
Ankara launched its offensive in the Afrin region on its border in January, aiming to drive out the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which it sees as an extension of the PKK group that has fought a three-decade insurgency inside Turkey. 
During the campaign it has managed to gain control over all the Afrin region's border areas with Turkey, including several small towns and a large number of villages. 
Despite being rivals with the Syrian government and having clashed with the Syrian army at times in the war, the YPG has asked Damascus to help it repel the Turkish assault. 
Last month, pro-Syrian government militias entered Afrin region to back up the YPG, but their deployment did not deter Turkey despite the possibility of a wider escalation in the war, and it continued its campaign. 
Afrin is separated from a much larger area held by Syrian Kurdish forces further east along the border with Turkey, including large swathes of land captured from Islamic State with support from the United States. 

On Friday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said the Turkish army would soon enter Afrin. He also vowed to sweep Kurdish fighters from the length of the border.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar Buddhist monk Wirathu said on Saturday his anti-Muslim rhetoric had nothing to do with violence in the western state of Rakhine, as he emerged from a one-year preaching ban.
Wirathu is the most prominent of Myanmar's hard-line nationalist monks, who have emerged as a political force since the country's transition from full military rule began in 2011.
Violence has hit Muslim communities across the Buddhist-majority country, but the nationalists' sharpest vitriol is reserved for the Rohingya Muslim minority in Rakhine, who many see as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, or ""Bengalis"".
Nearly 700,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since insurgents attacked police and army posts on Aug. 25, sparking a furious military-led response the United Nations has said constituted ethnic cleansing and possibly genocide. 
Rakhine was experiencing ""terrorism of Bengalis"", Wirathu said on Saturday, dismissing claims he had ""created"" conflict there. He cited the relative peace of his hometown, Mandalay.
""If Wirathu creates conflict, Mandalay would become ash. The world doesn’t know this truth,"" the monk said, referring to himself at a ceremony in Myanmar's largest city, Yangon, to celebrate his return to preaching.
The central Myanmar city of Mandalay was hit by communal riots that killed two people in 2014 after news spread of what turned out to be a false claim that Muslims had raped a Buddhist woman.
Wirathu traveled at least twice in the past year to the violence-hit northern part of Rakhine, despite Myanmar’s highest religious authority imposing a one-year preaching ban in March 2017.
The state-linked body's move was seen as an attempt by the government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi to stifle nationalists who threaten to undermine the young administration. Another nationalist monk, Parmaukkha, was released from prison on Friday after serving three months for a 2016 protest against the U.S. government's use of the word ""Rohingya"".
Wirathu reacted to his silencing by posting online photographs of himself with his mouth taped over, and by continuing to post videos and comments online. But his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account has not been accessible in recent months.
Facebook suspends and sometimes removes anyone that ""consistently shares content promoting hate"", a spokesperson said in response to a question about Wirathu's account.
""Our community standards prohibit organizations and people dedicated to promoting hatred and violence against others based on their protected characteristics,"" the spokesperson said by email.
Wirathu said he would continue his ""nationalist work"".
""When Facebook shuts (me) off, I rely on YouTube. YouTube is not wide-reaching enough so I will use Twitter to continue the nationalist work,"" he said.

In a message posted on Twitter, a Taliban spokesman said 53 commandos had been killed or wounded after arriving in Tapa Sadat, close to the Bala Buluk district center, and a sizeable quantity of weapons seized.
U.S. and Afghan officials say the Taliban have been under increasingly heavy pressure from air strikes and army operations but the insurgents have repeatedly demonstrated their ability to inflict severe damage on Afghan security forces.
This week's incident was the latest in a series to have hit Farah province, between the border with Iran and the Taliban heartland of Helmand province, source of much of Afghanistan's opium crop.
It came ahead of an expected increase in fighting with the end of winter and the approach of spring.

1439,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2018 07:11AM ET</span>","'No one above law' in Mexico graft fight, says presidential hopeful Meade","By Anthony Esposito
ACAPULCO (Reuters) - Mexico's attorney general should be given more autonomy to fight graft so that no one, not even the president, is above the law, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party's (PRI) presidential candidate Jose Antonio Meade said.
""If we want Mexico to be successful in its fight against corruption we have to cut the umbilical cord between the executive branch and the attorney general's office,"" Meade told Reuters in an interview on Friday.
Mexico's attorney general's office has been widely criticized by opposition politicians and justice reform advocates for moving slowly on cases that implicate the ruling party.
It released a video late last month of opposition presidential candidate Ricardo Anaya in an appearance at offices related to an investigation into accusations he illicitly profited from a real estate deal. 
The decision to release the footage, in which a member of Anaya's entourage swears, has been pilloried by academics, foreign diplomats and opposition politicians as an abuse of power intended to help the PRI.
An opinion poll taken after the video was released suggested the fight damaged both candidates, who lost support while front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador gained ground. 
Meade made no mention of the investigation in the interview.
Graft scandals have for decades dogged the political elite in Mexico, which ranked 128th out of 137 nations for ethics and corruption in the World Economic Forum's 2017-2018 Global Competitiveness Index.
Meade, who holds a doctorate in economics from Yale University, said he wanted to loosen the government's grip on the public prosecutor so that it was not beholden to changing political tides.
""We need to give the attorney general's office the autonomy to investigate even me when I'm president,"" said Meade, who served as finance minister for President Enrique Pena Nieto.
SCANDALS, INFIGHTING
Pena Nieto's administration has been hit by conflict-of-interest scandals and the PRI has been battered by corruption allegations against several of its governors.
Mexico is already implementing a new anti-corruption system that will replace the current attorney general's office with a new institution that is designed to be more independent from political interference. However, political infighting has prevented the new system from taking root.
Meade's campaign has struggled to gain traction despite his reputation as a clean politician who also served as a cabinet secretary for former President Felipe Calderon of the center-right National Action Party.
To differentiate himself from the lavish lifestyles associated with some PRI politicians, his campaign has released photos of him in economy class on commercial flights and driving a modest Toyota Prius car. 
However, his association with the ruling party and reluctance to criticize its performance has made it hard to position himself as a candidate of change. Most recent surveys show him in third place.
In 2016, Mexicanos Contra la Corrupcion y la Impunidad, a civil group, calculated corruption was worth between 2 percent and 10 percent of Mexico's gross domestic product, based on data from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and others.
Meade, who spoke after giving a speech at an annual bankers convention in the resort city of Acapulco, said Mexico needed to double its spending on ports, roads, airports, railways and energy pipelines to 4 percent of GDP.
He also said the United States and Mexico needed to reach an agreement on anti-drugs cooperation that reflected the reality that laws in many U.S. states no longer match federal policy.
California this year became the sixth U.S. state, and by far the most populous, to allow the sale of recreational marijuana. 
""An agreement that reflects consistency between U.S. federal and local policy is very important,"" Meade said.

The southwestern metropolis is one of China's most important cities, but it has been at the heart of two dramatic corruption scandals in recent years.
Its charismatic former Communist Party chief Bo Xilai, once seen as a contender for the top leadership, was jailed for life in 2013 for bribery, corruption and abuse of power, in a case kicked off by his wife's murder of a British businessman.
Last month Chinese prosecutors charged another party boss in the city, Sun Zhengcai, with bribery. Sun had also once been considered a contender for a national leadership position.
Xi, who has overseen a sweeping war on corruption since coming to power in late 2012, has parachuted in one of his close allies, Chen Miner, to take over Chongqing. 
Speaking to Chongqing legislators on the sidelines of China's annual meeting of parliament, Xi said that ""political ecology"" was like nature itself.
""If you take your eye off it for a moment then it's easy to become polluted,"" state media cited Xi as saying.
Officials have to set a good example and be moral and law-abiding citizens, he added.
A top priority is to ensure family members are not corrupt, Xi said.
""Prevent pillow talk from becoming a fuse for corruption, prevent your children from raising their own banners to illegally seek profit, prevent those around you from dragging you down.""

Speaking earlier in the week, Chongqing's current party chief Chen warned that the ""evil legacy"" of Bo had yet to be rooted out.

Sanchez is in jail awaiting trial on charges of rebellion and sedition relating to Catalonia’s illegal referendum last October and its unilateral declaration of independence.
The speaker of the Catalan parliament, Roger Torrent, said late on Friday that the session would be postponed while separatist groups challenge the court ruling at the European Court of Human Rights.

Pro-independence parties won a slim majority in elections in December but have so far been frustrated by court rulings in their attempts to elect a regional president as Madrid insists any candidate must not be in jail or under judicial investigation.

Relations between the two countries have been strained by Ankara’s support for Qatar after Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt imposed sanctions on Doha last year over its alleged support for Islamist militants. Qatar denies the accusations.
""It is no secret that Arab-Turkish relations aren't in their best state,"" UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash tweeted. 
""In order to return to balance, Ankara has to respect Arab sovereignty and deal with its neighbors with wisdom and rationality,"" he said. 
The UAE sees itself as a bulwark against political forms of Islam, and views Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's Islamist-rooted ruling AK party as a supporter of groups like the Muslim Brotherhood which it opposes.
They were drawn into a quarrel in December over a retweet by the Emirati foreign minister that Erdogan called an insult. 

UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahayan shared a tweet at the time that accused Turkish troops of looting the holy city of Medina a century ago, prompting Erdogan to lash out saying that the minister had been spoiled by oil money.

1443,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>",Afghan Taliban urge religious scholars to boycott peace conference,"KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban urged Islamic scholars on Saturday not to take part in a conference due to take place in Indonesia aimed at building agreement and support for possible future peace talks in Afghanistan.
The call follows President Ashraf Ghani's offer last month to hold peace talks with the Taliban and comes as international powers have sought to build pressure on the movement to accept negotiations to end more than 16 years of war in Afghanistan.
The Taliban have so far proved unresponsive to the offer. And on Saturday they said the proposed conference of religious scholars from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Indonesia was merely intended to ""legitimize the presence of infidel invaders in the Islamic country of Afghanistan"".
The conference, proposed by Indonesian President Joko Widodo in January and due to be held later this month, was an effort to present ""the sacred Jihad in Afghanistan ... as unlawful bloodshed"", the Taliban said in a statement. 
""Do not afford an opportunity to the invading infidels in Afghanistan to misuse your name and participation in this conference as means of attaining their malicious objective.""
Fighting to drive out international forces and re-establish their version of strict Islamic law, the Taliban control or contest large areas of Afghanistan and inflict heavy casualties on government security forces.
They have offered to talk to the United States about a possible peace agreement but have so far ruled out direct talks with the Western-backed government in Kabul, which they say is an illegitimate foreign-imposed regime.
Despite their unpromising rhetoric, however, Western diplomats say that efforts have been intensifying behind the scenes to lay the groundwork for possible future talks with regular contacts through intermediaries.
At the same time, the United States has stepped up battlefield pressure, notably through air strikes on the Taliban as Afghanistan's international partners have sought to build up diplomatic support from neighboring countries to push the movement to the negotiating table.
They have also invested considerable effort in trying to build consensus among religious scholars against tactics such as suicide bombings, which have been regularly carried out by Taliban and other insurgent groups.

1444,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>",Chinese official warns against creeping Islamisation,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese Muslims need to guard against creeping Islamisation, including mosques that copy foreign styles, and strive to practice their faith in a more Chinese way, a senior Chinese Islamic official said on Saturday.
China is home to roughly 20 million Muslims, many living in the western part of the country, from the Uighurs of Xinjiang who speak a Turkic language to the largely sinified Hui people.
While China officially guarantees freedom of religion, it has in recent years tightened controls in heavily Muslim areas, nervous about the possibility of radicalisation and violence.
Speaking to the largely ceremonial advisory body to China's parliament, Yang Faming, head of the government-linked China Islamic Association, said Islam had a long and glorious history in the country.
But Yang warned of problems he said had become apparent in recent years which could not be overlooked, according to a copy of his speech carried by the official Xinhua news agency.
""For example, some mosques' construction style blindly imitates foreign models. In some areas the concept of halal has become common, and religion interferes in secular life,"" he said.
""Some people set great store on religious rules and much less on national law, only knowing what it is to be a believer and not what it is to be a citizen,"" Yang added. ""We must certainly remain on high alert.""
Islam in China must uphold the successful experience of becoming more Chinese, be guided by core socialist values and oppose radicalisation, he said.
Religious practices, culture and the architecture of religious buildings must be Chinese in nature and style, Yang added.
Parliament and its advisory body are holding their annual session.
China has blamed a series of attacks in recent years in Xinjiang, which sits on the borders of Central Asia and Pakistan, on Islamist militants. Rights groups say the unrest is more a reaction to Chinese controls on the religious and cultural rights of the Uighurs who live there.
China denies accusations of repression in Xinjiang.

China's image among the wider Muslim community around the world is important to Beijing as it pushes President Xi Jinping's ""Belt and Road"" initiative to invest billions of dollars building infrastructure linking Asia, Europe and Africa.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Finance Ministry will admit altering documents involved in a controversial sale of state-owned land, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on Saturday, raising the heat on the finance minister and threatening to erode Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's popularity.
The ministry plans to report to parliament on Monday that it has found instances where content was deleted from documents submitted to lawmakers, the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Telephone calls seeking ministry comment went unanswered.
An admission would deal a fresh blow to Abe, who has struggled for months to draw a line under suspicion that a school operator used ties with Abe's wife to get a discounted deal on land in the western city of Osaka.
It would also ratchet up the pressure on Finance Minister Taro Aso, who said he had no intention to step down over the affair which led to the resignation on Friday of the National Tax Agency chief, Nobuhisa Sagawa.
On the day of Sagawa's resignation, media said police were investigating as a possible suicide the death of an official at a finance ministry bureau that handled the land deal. The government's chief spokesman said he had been notified about the death but declined to give details.
The scandal regained fresh momentum last week with opposition parties turning up the heat after the Asahi newspaper said some documents about the land sale might have been doctored.
Abe has denied that he or his wife did favors for the operator of the school, Moritomo Gakuen. Abe's grip on power has not appeared at risk so far, because his ruling coalition has big majorities in both houses of parliament.

But falling support could complicate his bid for a third term as Liberal Democratic Party leader in a September party vote. Re-election would put him on track to become Japan's longest-serving premier.

1446,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2018 10:29AM ET</span>",Syrian army gains ground in intensified Ghouta assault,"By Angus McDowall 
BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian army intensified its onslaught in eastern Ghouta on Saturday with advances that a war monitor and state media said had splintered the enclave, though a rebel official denied this. 
Syrian state television broadcast from inside Mesraba, a town lying along the road connecting the northern and southern halves of the rebel-held stronghold. 
The capture of Mesraba and advances into nearby farmland brought important roads directly under fire by the army, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. 
That has in effect cut the large towns of Harasta and Douma off from each other and the rest of the enclave, it added. 
However, Hamza Birqadar, a spokesman for Jaish al-Islam, one of the two main insurgent groups in eastern Ghouta, denied that either Harasta or Douma had been cut off. 
The relentless three-week assault on the last major rebel stronghold near Damascus has captured about half its area and killed 976 people, according to the Britain-based Observatory.
State television showed a huge plume of dark smoke rising behind houses and trees in eastern Ghouta, with the sound of blasts in the background. 
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Russia, his main ally, say the campaign is needed to end rebel shelling of Damascus and end the rule of Islamist insurgents over the area's civilians. 
The offensive follows the pattern of previous assaults on rebel strongholds, deploying air power and tight sieges to force insurgents to accept ""evacuation"" deals. 
These involve rebels surrendering territory in exchange for safe passage to opposition areas in northwest Syria, along with their families and other civilians who do not want to come back under Assad's rule. 
Late on Friday, a small number of fighters and their families from the former al Qaeda affiliate previously known as the Nusra Front left eastern Ghouta under such a deal. 
But the group represents only a small portion of the insurgent presence in the enclave. Jaish al-Islam and the other main eastern Ghouta rebel group Failaq al-Rahman have said they are not negotiating a similar deal for themselves. 
Capturing the enclave would represent Assad's biggest blow against the rebels since they were driven from Aleppo in December 2016. 
It would seal a string of military victories for the Syrian leader since the entry of Russian jets into the war on his side in 2015 turned the course of the conflict against the insurgents. 
SHORTAGES
The intensity of the government's attack on an enclave that has been besieged since 2013 and suffers acute shortages of food and medical supplies has drawn Western condemnation and demands by U.N. aid agencies for a humanitarian halt in fighting. 
State television broadcast from Mesraba showed a large group of civilians hiding in a house. People across eastern Ghouta have sheltered in basements from the ceaseless bombardment in recent weeks. 
A middle-aged man interviewed by the channel shouted slogans in support of Assad and against the rebels while women and small children stood behind him as men in army uniforms looked on.
State media said the 60 civilians found in Mesraba by the army had been held by insurgents as human shields, something the rebel groups deny. 
Footage taken on the streets of Mesraba showed tanks near half-collapsed buildings and walls pocked with bullet holes.
The United Nations estimates that 400,000 people are trapped in eastern Ghouta.
""Living conditions are harsh ... Shop owners and traders are sending their workers to the shelters to sell food for three times the price before the offensive,"" said a man in the eastern Ghouta town of Saqba who identified himself as Abu Abdo in a voice message. 
Aid agencies have tried to deliver food and medicine into eastern Ghouta, but have been able only to bring in a portion of the amount they wanted. 
A convoy was unable to finish unloading on Monday because of continued fighting, bringing in the remaining undelivered food parcels on Friday despite bombardment nearby. 
However, U.N. agencies said most medical supplies had been stripped from the convoy by Syrian government officials and that the food supplies brought in were insufficient. 
Medical charities operating in eastern Ghouta have reported several incidents in recent weeks of what they say was chlorine gas use in government bombardments, causing choking symptoms. 
On Saturday, Syria's deputy foreign minister, Faisal Mekdad, rejected those charges and accused the United States of orchestrating the accusations in order to support militant groups. ""We did not deny a single request for investigation,"" Mekdad told a news conference. 
The government has opened what it says are several safe routes out of eastern Ghouta for civilians, but none are known to have left so far. Damascus and Moscow accuse the rebels of preventing people from fleeing the fighting. 
Insurgent groups in eastern Ghouta deny this, saying people have not left for fear of government persecution, but a Reuters witness on Friday saw gunfire and mortar fire from inside rebel territory near one of the crossing points. 
Sajjad Malik, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees representative in Syria, who went in with the convoy on Monday, said in comments published on the agency's website that people did not feel safe to leave.

People in Douma told him they feared crossing rebel checkpoints and were uncertain whether they would be safe when they reached government-held areas, Malik said.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar police said on Saturday they had opened a murder investigation into the killing of two men that residents say appeared to have been shot in the head after they were detained by soldiers in the conflict-torn north of the country.
Residents say the men were ethnic Kachin farmers who were living in camps for people displaced by conflict in Maing Hkawng, a village about 30 km (20 miles) from Myanmar's border with China.
More than 100,000 have been forced from their villages since a ceasefire between Myanmar's army and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) broke down in 2011.
The northern conflict is separate from the Rohingya crisis stemming from western Rakhine state but the military's campaign has similarly been beset by allegations of abuses against civilians.
Ethnic Kachin men Hpaugan Yaw, 65, and Nhkum Naw San, 35, had been missing since they were taken away by the military on Jan. 31, according to residents and campaign group Fortify Rights, which interviewed two witnesses to their detention. 
A shallow grave containing two bodies was discovered on Thursday by a civilian search party in a forest near Maing Khawng, in Kachin state's Mansi township. Authorities visited the grave on Friday and a doctor conducted an autopsy on the bodies.
""The case has been filed at Mansi police station under section 302 (of Myanmar’s Penal Code), a murder charge,” said Thura Myo Naung, a spokesman for police in Kachin state who declined to comment further other than to say police were investigating.
The Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement posted on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page the bodies had ""penetration wounds on the left cheek"" and the backs of their heads had ""exploded"".
The men went missing while herding buffalo, according to a missing persons complaint filed on Feb. 5, said the statement, which did not mention the alleged involvement of soldiers.
Military spokesman Major General Tun Tun Nyi declined to comment on the case.
Fortify Rights had raised concerns about the two men last month and cited two witnesses who said they saw soldiers detain them. One witness said soldiers tried to put KIA uniforms on the men, according to the group, which kept the witnesses anonymous.
Aung Myu San, a Kachin youth leader in Maing Hkawng, said the doctor's autopsy report had not yet been made available but he had seen the bodies along with other residents.
""When we personally went there to look, we saw the situation and we thought it looked like a gunshot to the mouth because the back part of the head is totally gone,"" he said.
Myanmar's security forces are also accused of rape, murder and arson of Muslim Rohingya in a campaign launched in response to insurgent attacks in August in the western Rakhine state, prompting hundreds of thousands to flee to neighboring Bangladesh.
Myanmar has asked for ""clear evidence"" of atrocities in Rakhine, but the U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein called on Friday for Myanmar to be referred to the International Criminal Court for what he said may be ""acts of genocide"" against the stateless Rohingya minority.

1449,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>","In state media, China presents itself as crucial to U.S.-North Korea talks","By Ben Blanchard
BEIJING (Reuters) - China helped bring about a dramatic easing of tensions between the United States and North Korea, according state media outlets, adding evidence that the government sees itself as a central player in any agreement despite largely sitting on the sidelines so far.
The commentary seeks to cast the planned talks between the two Koreas - and a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un - as the result of Chinese efforts.
The Communist Party's official People's Daily cited China's plan for North Korea to suspend nuclear and missile tests, and South Korea and the United States to suspend military drills as leading to this moment.
""It should be understood that these easing of tension signals are actually an effect brought about by the 'dual suspension'"" proposal, the paper said on Saturday. 
The paper cited Trump as telling Chinese President Xi Jinping in a telephone call on Friday that China's position that the United States should talk to North Korea was the correct one.
""The U.S. side profusely thanked and put high importance on China's important role in the Korean peninsula issue,"" the paper said in its regular ""Zhong Sheng,"" or ""voice of China,"" column, which presents the paper's position on foreign policy.
China has been front and center in diplomatic efforts over North Korea, long pushing for a resumption of talks to get North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. A decade ago, it hosted numerous rounds of negotiations that fizzled out.
It has also been deeply involved in diplomatic efforts at the United Nations.
But its relations with North Korea have nosedived. There are few high-level contacts between the two countries at present, and North Korea's youthful leader, Kim, widely derided on Chinese social media as ""Fatty Kim,"" has not visited China since taking power in 2011.
China played little obvious role in the thaw between the two Koreas at last month's Winter Olympics, which saw a high-level North Korean delegation attend and set the groundwork for an inter-Korean summit in April.
Han Zheng, Shanghai's former Communist Party boss, led China's delegation at the opening ceremony. Though he is the party's seventh-ranked leader, with a position on the party's elite Standing Committee, which runs China, he has little diplomatic experience.
China said he met the North Koreans, but gave no details on what was said. Beijing-based diplomats say contacts between China and North Korea have been sporadic, limited to party-to-party exchanges, and have yielded nothing.
CHINA'S ROLE ""CAN'T BE AVOIDED""
Beijing has key strategic interests when it comes to North Korea, and has long feared that a collapse of its isolated neighbor could push waves of refugees into northeastern China, or that nuclear war on the Korean peninsula could contaminate swathes of the country.
The emotional ties are deep too. The two countries fought side by side in the 1950-53 Korean War - a son of Mao Zedong's died in the conflict - and China has long viewed North Korea as a useful buffer between it and U.S. forces in South Korea.
So although peace is Beijing's earnest desire, it needs to ensure China's interests are properly accounted for.
Zheng Jiyong, director of the Centre for Korean Studies at Shanghai's Fudan University, said in an interview posted on the WeChat account of the overseas edition of the People's Daily that China must be involved in U.S.-North Korea talks.
""China's role can't be avoided, and there's no way for it to be kept away,"" Zheng said.
If the United States and North Korea really want results, China is the only country that can play the role of guarantor, he added.
""No matter the direction of North Korea-U.S. talks, be it war or peace, if there is no help or obstruction from China then it's impossible for there to be real stability on the peninsula,"" he said.
State media have sought to downplay any implication that China is being marginalized, and reinforce the point that China has a vital part to play.
""China will advocate the international security mechanism and help prevent North Korea from being deceived or squeezed by the U.S. once it begins to denuclearize,"" widely read tabloid the Global Times wrote in an editorial. 
""China will welcome the dialogue between the U.S. and North Korea, and resolutely support North Korea securing its due interests in the process of denuclearization. Through these efforts, China's interests will not be pushed aside,"" it said.
Exactly what China wants to do is unclear at this point, though it might want to host the Trump-Kim get-together.
China's Foreign Ministry said on Friday the country would continue to play a ""positive role"" in pushing for a political resolution and for lasting peace and stability. But it offered no other details and avoided directly answering a question on whether it could host the Trump-Kim talks.
""China will feel very good in the sense that basically North Korea has offered something that looks like an endorsement of the dual suspension strategy,"" said Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing.

But ""in terms of the direct talks and negotiations, China is no longer the most relevant player,"" he said. ""And given the progress is taking place at such a rapid pace there is increasing concern in China that China's being kept out of the whole thing and that China's losing control, even though again China is, in general, supportive of this progress.""

Duterte's attacks against U.N. human rights activists suggest he needs to see a psychiatrist, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein told a news conference on Friday.
Zeid's comments came after the Philippine justice ministry filed a petition in a Manila court seeking the declaration of more than 600 alleged communist guerrillas, including a U.N. special rapporteur, as ""terrorists"", a development first reported by Reuters.
The petition included Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, appointed in 2014 as U.N. special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, who was listed as a senior member of the country's Maoist rebel group.
Tauli-Corpuz called the complaint ""baseless, malicious and irresponsible"".
Zeid said Duterte's attacks against U.N. special rapporteurs cannot go unanswered and the U.N. Human Rights Council must take a position. He said the Philippine leader ""needs to submit himself to some sort of psychiatric examination"".
Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano said: ""The Philippines takes grave exception to the irresponsible and disrespectful comments of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights that cast untoward aspersions regarding the President of the Republic of the Philippines.""
Duterte has also repeatedly insulted the current U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, Agnes Callamard, because of her criticism of his bloody anti-narcotics campaign.
The Philippines welcomed a U.N. investigation into Duterte's signature war on drugs but objected to Callamard leading it, saying she was biased and not qualified.
Cayetano said in a strongly worded statement the Philippines was bothered by ""the manner in which a ranking U.N. human rights official can overstep his mandate and insult leaders of member-states without first giving them due process"".
""This could set a dangerous precedent that the council would have to immediately address as otherwise member-states could also fall victim to those who seek to politicize and weaponize human rights to undermine legitimate governments,"" he said.
Duterte's spokesman, Harry Roque, said Zeid's language was an affront to Philippine sovereignty.

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein said on Wednesday that crimes against humanity may have been committed by state forces in Venezuela and voiced alarm at “the erosion of democratic institutions” in the country.
Maduro, who says there is a right-wing plot to sabotage his government, deflected the criticism during brief comments to journalists broadcast on state television.
""The high commissioner is a militant of the fascist Venezuelan right. ... He is a pawn of the State Department who is embedded like a tumor in the human rights system,"" Maduro said. ""He is a person who has lost all credibility to opine about our country.""
Opposition politicians say an increasingly isolated Maduro is picking fights with foreign critics instead of trying to fix a brutal economic meltdown in the oil-rich country. Venezuelans are suffering a fifth year of a recession that has sparked disease, malnutrition, hyperinflation and mass emigration.
The main opposition coalition is boycotting a May presidential election, saying it is a farce intended to legitimize Maduro's “dictatorship.” 

Zeid also criticized the vote this week, saying that the context “does not in any way fulfill minimal conditions for free and credible elections.""

1454,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 06:20PM ET</span>",Showman Trump abandons cautious Obama approach to North Korea,"By Steve Holland and Jeff Mason
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When President Barack Obama counseled his successor Donald Trump on the global threats he should expect to face once he assumed office last year, a nuclear North Korea and its unpredictable leader were at the top of the list.
But while the meticulous Obama practiced caution in handling Kim Jong Un, the blustery Trump succumbed to his own penchant for reality TV showmanship, culminating with his shock decision on Thursday to agree to meet with North Korea's leader and become the first sitting U.S. president to do so.
Trump's move is a sharp departure from 60 years of largely arms-length U.S. diplomacy when it comes to North Korea, not to mention his own previous bellicose rhetoric against Pyongyang. It also represents another instance in which the Republican Trump, a businessman who promised to shake up Washington, took a completely different direction than his Democratic predecessor.
Trump's willingness to take that dramatic step is a reflection of his showboat style, throwing out the diplomatic playbook and putting himself in the spotlight, in addition to what aides say is his desire to resolve the North Korea crisis before it spins out of control.
""It's hard to know whether this is just his supreme confidence that he can get a deal done with his own business experience, or whether he is calculating that he wins either way,"" said Jim Steinberg, who served as deputy secretary of state under Democratic President Bill Clinton. ""It's always hard to know with Trump how well thought through this is.""
Obama, like his immediate predecessors, took a far more deliberate approach. As a presidential candidate he famously suggested meeting with U.S. enemies, and ended up relaunching Washington's relationships with Cuba and Iran as president. 
But he did not take that same step with North Korea, once warning Pyongyang that ""you don't get to bang your spoon on the table and somehow you get your way.""
Officials who served in Obama's administration said there was a reason he never met with his North Korean counterpart.
""Our assessment was that the North Koreans weren't serious about denuclearization and therefore sitting down to a summit just accords legitimacy ... to the regime, not just the leader, without achieving any concrete national security objective for the United States,"" said Michael McFaul, U.S. ambassador to Russia under Obama.
'FEEL THE PRESSURE'
Trump's advisers have harbored similar beliefs, but their boss appears ready to seize North Korea's olive branch.
White House officials said that when South Korean national security adviser Chung Eui-yong relayed Kim's invitation in an Oval Office meeting on Thursday, Trump readily agreed, feeling that U.S.-led sanctions were weakening North Korea.
""He believes that he has them at a disadvantage, and that they only made the gesture because they feel the pressure badly, and so this is a good time,"" a senior White House official said.
While Trump's move was welcomed by many experts as a way to get the two nations to step back from the brink of conflict, veterans of the Obama administration and other presidencies called for caution and careful diplomacy because of North Korea's history of breaking agreements.
""We have to be clear-eyed that if this meeting is done in isolation, absent from a broader strategy that advances American interests, it will be a propaganda coup for Kim,"" said Ned Price, a former national security council spokesman for Obama.
Clinton obtained an agreement to contain North Korea's nuclear program and came close to a visit to Pyongyang after sending his secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, there in 2000. North Korea ended up abandoning the Clinton-era agreement.
Bill Richardson, Clinton's U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who has made multiple diplomatic missions to North Korea, called the Trump-Kim summit a gamble.
""I worry that he might be falling into a trap,"" Richardson said of Trump, adding he did not expect the first such summit to produce much but that Kim frequently has been underestimated.
Jay Lefkowitz, who was Republican President George W. Bush's human rights envoy for North Korea, said Trump's meeting is fraught with peril.
""I have some real anxiety about it. But on the other hand I'd rather have dialogue than missiles flying,"" Lefkowitz said.

The four were arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage and being unlawfully on diplomatic premises, a spokeswoman for London's Metropolitan Police said.
No one was hurt during the incident and the four were arrested when they came down voluntarily after around three hours.
Iran's ambassador to Britain, Hamid Baeidnejad, tweeted that the assailants were ""advocates of the Shirazi cult"" and had replaced Iran's national flag with that of their group. He said all staff at the embassy were safe.
Shi'ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Sadegh Hossein Shirazi, whose son was recently arrested for insulting Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has been a fierce critic of Iran’s clerical leadership.
Iranian state television quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying that Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi had protested about the incident to the British ambassador in Tehran.
""Britain is responsible for the safety of Iranian diplomats,"" said the spokesman, Bahram Qasemi.
Iran's state news agency IRNA said the attackers had carried knives and sticks. Iran's English-language Press TV said a religious group was behind the attack, without elaborating.
Images posted on social media showed four men in black attire on the balcony of the embassy, waving a blue and white flag.
In 1980, gunmen seized the embassy to try to secure the release of Iranian political prisoners. One hostage was killed in the five-day siege, and another died when British commandos stormed the building, killing all but one of the gunmen.

YOUNTVILLE, Calif. (Reuters) - Details emerged on Saturday about a decorated former U.S. serviceman who took three women hostage at a California veterans home where he had undergone treatment for PTSD, in a standoff that ended when police found him and his captives dead.
The Veterans Home of California in Yountville, the largest such facility in the United States, was the scene on Friday of the latest mass shooting to rock a country still shocked by the slaughter last month of 17 people at a Florida high school.
Officials named the gunman as Albert Wong, 36, of Sacramento, and said he had served with the U.S. Army on active duty from May 2010 to August 2013 and spent a year in Afghanistan. He received four medals including an Afghanistan campaign medal and was awarded an Expert Marksmanship Badge with Rifle, the Pentagon said. 
Wong had been a patient of Pathway Home, a program at the Yountville complex for former service members suffering post-traumatic stress disorder after deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. The San Francisco Chronicle, citing unnamed sources, said he had been asked to leave the program two weeks ago.
Yountville Mayor John Dunbar, who also serves as a board member of the Pathway Home, said the facility and the town mourned the loss of the three women.
""We also lost one of our heroes, who clearly had demons that resulted in the terrible tragedy that we all experienced here,"" he told reporters.
The incident began at about 10:30 a.m. PST on Friday at the sprawling facility about 60 miles north of San Francisco and ended almost eight hours later.
According to Larry Kamer, the husband of one of the Pathway Home administrators, Devereaux Smith, Wong walked into the program's building carrying a rifle during a going-away party for one of the employees.
Kamer, who volunteers at the home, said his wife told him by phone during the siege that the gunman had let her and three other women leave the room where the party was taking place, but that he kept three female employees behind as hostages.
The hostages who died were named as Pathway Home Executive Director Christine Loeber, 48; the program's clinical director, therapist Jen Golick, 42; and Jennifer Gonzales, 29, a psychologist with the San Francisco Department of Veterans Affairs Healthcare System.
""Each of them brought energy, vitality, personality to their jobs, and that's so critical when we're talking about supporting our veterans who have post-traumatic stress or traumatic brain injury in particular,"" Dunbar said.
Despite repeated efforts by police negotiators, authorities said they had failed to make contact with the gunman after he exchanged fire with a sheriff's deputy at the start of the standoff. 
Officers who eventually entered the room where the hostages were being held found all four bodies there, police said. No details were immediately given about how they died.
President Donald Trump said on Twitter, ""We are deeply saddened by the tragic situation in Yountville and mourn the loss of three incredible women who cared for our Veterans."" 
James Musson, a 75-year-old Army veteran and resident of the facility, told Reuters many who lived there voiced concerns about lax security, saying visitors could walk in and out without restriction and that public safety officers were not armed.
Dunbar said the deaths were the first ""serious incident"" at the home since it began to treat veterans more than 10 years ago. He was scheduled to meet officials from the California Department of Veterans Affairs to discuss how to move ahead.
The siege came less than a month after a former student killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida, using an assault-style rifle. That massacre sparked a student-led drive for new restrictions on gun sales to curb mass shootings.

NICOSIA (Reuters) - Turkish Cypriots will launch their own exploration for oil and gas around Cyprus if Greek Cypriots persist with their own plans, their foreign minister said on Friday, as an uneasy standoff lingered over offshore resources.
Greek Cypriots, who run Cyprus's internationally recognized government, have licensed several offshore blocks to multinationals for oil and gas exploration. But Italy's Eni abandoned a scheduled drill last month because of the presence of Turkish military vessels. A division of ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) is due to launch an exploration attempt this year.
""Either we will do it together - by discussing, agreeing and moving together - or things will stop, or, we (Turkish Cypriots) will do the same thing: we will start exploiting and drilling as well,"" said Kudret Ozersay, foreign minister of Northern Cyprus, a breakaway state recognized only by Turkey.
Turkey has vowed to prevent what it sees as a unilateral move by Greek Cypriots, but EU member Cyprus has shown no signs of backing down. Brussels has urged Turkey to avoid threats and refrain from actions that could damage relations with the bloc.
Asked whether the dispute could escalate, Ozersay said diplomacy would be the first tool: ""We aim at cooling down the waters, not warming them up."" 
""For that reason in the most recent (incident) we did not use force. We did not even demonstrate force. There was deterrence there,"" he said, adding the Turkish Cypriot side had pursued diplomacy before then.
Torn apart in a Turkish invasion in 1974 after a Greek-inspired coup, seeds of division were sown earlier, when a power-sharing arrangement between Greek and Turkish Cypriots crumbled amid violence just three years after the former British colony gained independence. Greek Cypriots were left running the internationally recognized government.
""HISTORIC RIGHTS""
""Our argument on the issue of maritime areas is not based on geography,"" Ozersay said, to an observation that Cyprus has only licensed maritime exploration areas lying south of the island, where it exercises effective control, and not to the north.
""It is based on historic rights and the rights deriving from the partnership republic,"" he said from his office, less than 5 km (3 miles) from a checkpoint where hundreds of Cypriots cross daily between the two sides. 
""The thing is, not only the Turkish Cypriot side, but also the international community and the Greek Cypriot side accepts and acknowledges that we are the co-owners of those hydrocarbon resources,"" Ozersay said. 
Greek Cypriots have repeatedly said a peace deal would allow both communities to benefit from any offshore resources, and have baulked at including the issue in reunification discussions. But peace talks collapsed last year, with no sign of resuming soon.
The talks ended primarily over a dispute on the role Turkey would play in a post-reunification Cyprus. Ankara has more than 25,000 troops in northern Cyprus, and Greek Cypriots insist their departure be integral to any deal.
Although the sides have agreed, in principle, to unite Cyprus as a bicommunal bizonal federation based on political equality, they do not have the same interpretation of what that means, Ozersay said. 

""We don't understand the same thing from the same sentence. We are repeating the same sentence, but we don't understand the same thing. That's the problem.""

KANDY/COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (Reuters) - Sri Lankan police said on Friday they were investigating whether 10 suspected ringleaders of a wave of attacks on Muslims by Sinhalese Buddhists had outside funding or foreign help.
The suspected leader of the group, Amith Jeewan Weerasinghe, and nine others were detained on Thursday on suspicion of involvement in attacks on mosques and Muslim-owned properties in the central Kandy district by nationalist crowds.
At least two people have been killed in the clashes, which began on Sunday. 
""We are investigating who funded them, their future plans, and whether they have any local political leadership and whether there was any foreign involvement behind this,"" police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara told reporters in Colombo. 
He said all 10 suspects had been remanded in custody for 14 days and brought to Colombo for questioning. He said three were from Kandy and the other seven from outside the district. 
In the 24 hours to 6 a.m. (0030 GMT) on Friday, six properties were reported to have been damaged while 65 people were arrested across Kandy, Gunasekara said.
A Reuters reporter saw a house in a suburb of the town of Kandy that had been gutted by fire after the owner and his family left in fear of an attack. 
Cabinet spokesman Dayasiri Jayasekara said police in some places had failed to carry out orders to curb the violence.
Sri Lanka's Muslims make up about 9 percent of its 21 million people and mostly live in the east and center of the island. Buddhist Sinhalese account for about 70 percent and ethnic Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, about 13 percent.
Some Buddhist nationalists have protested against the presence in Sri Lanka of Muslim Rohingya asylum-seekers from mostly Buddhist Myanmar, where Buddhist nationalism has also been on the rise.
However, in some areas, Sinhalese have helped Muslims to protect mosques, Muslim community leaders told Reuters.
Hundreds of Sinhalese including monks held a rally against the violence in Colombo on Friday, while many Muslim shopkeepers closed their doors in protest at the attacks.
Police reimposed a curfew in Kandy from 8 p.m. on Friday until 5 a.m. on Saturday.
However, foreign visitors to the town, a prime tourist destination, were to be allowed out in the curfew if they had their passports with them.

Sri Lanka was for decades plagued by war between government forces and Tamil separatists. The government defeated the rebels in 2009.

Murat Sabuncu, editor-in-chief of the newspaper Cumhuriyet, and writer Ahmet Sik were ordered released, the lawyer said. However, Cumhuriyet said that its attorney, Akin Atalay, was remanded in custody until the next hearing, on March 16.
Prosecutors charge that Cumhuriyet was effectively taken over by supporters of Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based cleric blamed by the government for a 2016 failed coup. The newspaper and staff deny the charges and say they are being targeted to silence critics of President Tayyip Erdogan.
Prosecutors are seeking up to 43 years in jail for the newspaper staff, who stand accused of targeting Erdogan through ""asymmetric war methods.""
Social media posts made up most of evidence in the indictment, along with allegations that staff had been in contact with users of Bylock, an encrypted messaging app the government says was used by Gulen's followers. 
Rights group Amnesty International said on Twitter that the ruling was ""long overdue"" and called for the release of all jailed journalists in Turkey.
Speaking after his release, Sabuncu said their release was not a reason to be happy, since several journalists remained in prison.
""We should not be happy that we have been released because our release does not mean things have changed in Turkey regarding freedom of speech,"" Sabuncu told reporters.
Sik reiterated Sabuncu's comments, saying he would rather see anger than happiness.
""I am not happy in any way. I don't want you to be happy while Akin Atalay is still inside. I would prefer if you were angry, for anger will keep us standing,"" Sik said.
""Today is not a day for us to be happy, but there will come a day when we will be happy in this country,"" he said.
Around 150 media outlets have been shut down and 160 journalists have been jailed, the Turkish Journalists Association says.
Earlier on Friday, Turkey's highest court overturned a five-year jail sentence for Cumhuriyet's former editor-in-chief, Can Dundar, saying he should face up to 20 years in prison on espionage charges, the state-run news agency Anadolu said.
Since the July 2016 coup attempt, more than 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from their jobs in Turkey, and another 50,000 have been arrested over alleged links to Gulen's network.
Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in the United States since 1999, has denied involvement in the abortive putsch, in which more than 240 people were killed.

ACAPULCO (Reuters) - Mexico's left-wing presidential frontrunner on Friday tried to assuage the fears of a skeptical audience of bankers that he would run a radical economic agenda, vowing not to nationalize, expropriate or drive the country deeper into debt.
Speaking at a major banking conference in the Pacific resort of Acapulco, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador received mixed reviews for a speech packed with promises not to disrupt economic stability, but short on new policy proposals.
""We will support banks and we won't confiscate assets,"" he said. ""There won't be expropriations or nationalizations."" He said he would not raise taxes or debt and vowed to respect central bank autonomy.
Lopez Obrador's commitments to respecting the financial system and seeking ways to expand access to banking were welcome, said Rodrigo Zorrilla, the president of CitiBanamex. 
But some bankers said the presidential candidate, known locally as AMLO, did not give enough concrete policy proposals to set their hearts racing.
""AMLO lost the opportunity during this convention to present to the banking sector how he plans to accelerate the economy in Mexico in the short, medium and long term,"" said Diego Folino, the deputy chief executive at the Bank of China Mexico. ""There was an absence of strategic proposals.""
Lopez Obrador, 64, has sought the presidency twice before. This time, with a double-digit lead over his nearest rival in most opinion polls, he has sought to soften his image, moderating his previous opposition to the government's attempts to open up Mexico's energy sector to foreign investment, and surrounding himself with former rivals. 
Lopez Obrador's governance would ultimately be dictated by his margin of victory, noted Zorrilla.
""If he wins by a small margin, his policies are likely to be more moderate,"" he said.
Former Mexico City mayor Lopez Obrador reminded the audience that he worked closely with the private sector when he ran the capital from 2000-2005, while making clear where his priorities lie. 
""We are going to listen to everyone, respect everyone ... for the benefit of everyone - first of all the poor,"" he said. His focus would be on governance rather than legislative changes, and those there were would not be until the middle of his six-year term, he added.
He received polite applause for a speech that prioritized increasing welfare spending, reviving the rural economy and building new oil refineries. 
But the well-heeled crowd responded more enthusiastically to his political rivals, including Ricardo Anaya, candidate for a right-left alliance, who talked of bringing a 21st century knowledge economy to Mexico fueled by clean energy. 

Ruling party candidate, former finance minister Jose Antonio Meade, received rowdy applause for a speech that focused on improving the rule of law and economic stability. Meade is in third place in most polls after a damaging fight with Anaya, who has also lost support in recent polls.

Brenda Lucki, who has been with the force for 31 years, will take over as commissioner in mid-April, Trudeau told a televised ceremony at the RCMP's training academy in Regina, Saskatchewan.
The previous commissioner, Bob Paulson, retired last June after more than five years in the job. During his tenure, Paulson gave a tearful apology as the national police force reached a settlement agreement over a series of harassment, discrimination and sexual abuse claims that deeply embarrassed the force.
The RCMP is also under fire for not doing enough to protect Canada's largely marginalized and impoverished aboriginal population.
""We know we have a lot of work to do... to restore the RCMP to the full position of trust that it really should have in the eyes of Canadians,"" Trudeau said.
He said the RCMP needed to become better and stronger and said Lucki would ""play a vital role in advancing reconciliation with indigenous peoples, promoting gender equality ... (and) addressing workplace harassment.""
Lucki said she would ask all the right kinds of questions, ""including some difficult ones,"" and would challenge assumptions about how the RCMP operates.
The RCMP has around 20,000 uniformed members. It also provides policing in eight of Canada's 10 provinces.
The appointment of Lucki was welcomed by the National Police Federation, a union group that represents more than half of the force's members and has been pushing for reform of its leadership.
""We hope her selection and appointment will trigger an era of renewed investment for the 17,000-plus men and women who serve across the country, and a more supportive environment for female members in particular,"" Brian Sauve, the founder of the group, said in a statement.

The anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPO), junior partner in the coalition government led by Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conservatives, controls the interior, foreign and defense ministries. That has prompted its opponents to question how it will handle the sensitive information those departments possess.
Last week police raided the offices of the BVT domestic intelligence service and searched the homes of some BVT staff as part of an investigation into suspected misuse of office by some employees.
Such raids are already unusual, but Austrian weekly Profil and newspaper Der Standard jointly reported this week that they were carried out by a police unit not normally responsible for such operations and which is headed by a member of the FPO. 
One of the BVT officials targeted heads a unit specializing in ""extremism"", the media said. A hard drive containing information on organizations including right-wing groups such as fraternities that are often close to the FPO was copied and seized in the raids, they added.
""The actions surrounding the ... #BVT are extremely unusual and irritating,"" President Alexander Van der Bellen said on Twitter on Friday. ""I expect the departments responsible to provide a quick and thorough explanation.""
""FAKE NEWS""
The Interior Ministry dismissed the media reports.
""The story constructed by the media that the Interior Ministry obtained or wanted to obtain access to data on right-wing extremism with a (police) unit headed by a member of the FPO is in the realm of 'fake news',"" it said in a statement issued late on Thursday. 
The police unit in question normally deals with street crime.
The case has already set off a political storm, with opposition parties also demanding explanations.
""The whole thing is outrageous. It stinks to high heaven,"" the leader of the liberal Neos party, Matthias Strolz, told state broadcaster ORF.
The leader of the Social Democrats, Christian Kern, said: ""Trust in the security apparatus has been shaken drastically.""
The secretary general of the Justice Ministry, which is controlled by the conservatives, said on Friday no official files on extremist groups had been seized in the raid on the home of the BVT official who headed that department.
""The extremism data... has not been seized,"" Christian Pilnacek told reporters, adding that only personal files were taken. He said a prosecutor was present at each raid and the police had not had access to the files after they were seized.

However, the Justice Ministry has requested explanations from the anti-corruption prosecutors' office that jointly ordered the raids, Pilnacek said. Questions included why that particular police unit was chosen, he added.

ONITSHA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Nigeria's immigration service has launched an investigation after two of its staff members were arrested on suspicion of trying to traffic girls out of the country, it said on Friday. 
Thousands of girls are each year taken illegally out of Africa's most populous country, where 70 percent of the 190 million inhabitants live on less than two dollars a day. A large proportion of them arrive in Europe.
""We received information that two of our officers were arrested yesterday at Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, while trying to facilitate the trafficking of some underaged girls out of the country,"" spokesman James Sunday said.
""The comptroller general of immigration has been briefed about this and we have started investigations,"" he added. 
The spokesman did not say how many girls were involved, nor did he give their ages or say where they were allegedly being taken. The movement of people out of the country by criminal gangs, often by sea rather than air, has become a major problem for authorities in the west African country. 
The British government says Nigeria is the fourth largest source of human trafficking to its shores and Nigerians are the largest national group among African migrants traveling to Libya and trying to cross from there to Italy in boats. 
A report by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) published last year estimated that 80 percent of Nigerian girls arriving in Italy by sea might be trafficking victims.

K.T. Naveen Kumar was arrested on suspicion of supplying the weapons used to kill Gauri Lankesh, according to a senior police officer, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to talk to media. More arrests are expected, he said.
Lankesh, the editor and publisher of the Kannada-language newspaper Gauri Lankesh Patrike, was shot dead outside her home in the southern city of Bengaluru in September.
The murder of Lankesh, a staunch advocate of secularism and critic of right-wing political ideology, sparked protests across India.
Kumar, according to the police official, was a member of a hard-line Hindu group called the Sanatan Sanstha. The group was earlier accused of being involved in the murder of a well-known atheist. Officials at Sanatan Sanstha were not immediately available for comment.
The Sanatan Sanstha, one of the many Hindu fringe groups, have gained prominence since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party came to power in 2014.

The Kenyan government shut down three television channels in January on the day opposition leader Raila Odinga took a symbolic presidential oath, then defied a court order to switch them back on. The stations had planned to live-stream the oath.
""We believe that there are actions that need to be taken in Kenya and that they need to correct certain actions like shutting down independent TV stations and threatening the independence of the courts,"" Tillerson told a news conference in the Kenyan capital. 
""I know Kenya takes these matters seriously. A free and independent media is essential for safeguarding democracy and giving all Kenyans confidence in their government.""
Asked at the news conference with Tillerson if Kenya could call itself a democracy in light of restrictions appeared intended to stifle dissent, Kenya's foreign affairs minister, Monica Juma, said that ""the notion that there is a restriction of the media is not backed by fact or reality.
She said that only ""three of more than 10s"" of TV stations were temporarily shut down. The three stations taken off air reach the majority of viewers in the country. 
In September, after Kenya's Supreme Court overturned President Uhuru Kenyatta's election victory and ordered a new poll, Kenyatta dismissed the judges as ""wakora"", meaning ""crooks"" in Swahili. He also said the country had a ""problem"" with its judiciary that needed to be fixed.
Tillerson, the top U.S. diplomat, praised Kenyatta and opposition leader Odinga for meeting on Friday and pledging to bring their people together after last year's contentious and bloody elections.
""All the credit"" for the meeting went to the Kenyan political leaders, Tillerson said, in response to a question as to whether the U.S. had a role in organizing it.
As expected, Tillerson also emphasized the U.S. security partnership with Kenya and what he called ""our shared fight against terrorism"". He said he would pay his respects on Saturday in Nairobi to victims of the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The bombings killed 224 people.
He also recognized the 4,000 Kenyan troops fighting al-Shabaab in Somalia as part of the African Union peacekeeping mission AMISOM. 
Analysts say the Trump administration has focused mainly on security concerns in Africa at a time when China, Turkey and other nations are ramping up diplomatic and business links.
""The U.S. is no longer the dominant external actor in Africa, and must compete for influence not only with China, but a host of other, increasingly assertive, states pursuing their own agendas, such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Turkey, Japan and India,"" said EJ Hogendoorn, deputy Africa program director at the International Crisis Group think tank.
At Tillerson's two news conferences on Friday, in Djibouti and Nairobi, the typical arrangement for news conferences involving the secretary and his counterpart in the host country were changed, American reporters traveling with Tillerson said.
Typically, reporters with Tillerson and from the host country get to ask the same number of questions. But at both news conferences on Friday, the U.S. journalists were allowed only one question while local journalists in the two countries asked multiple questions.

U.S. officials did not intervene to allow the U.S. journalists to ask questions, according to a Reuters witness.

YOLA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Nigerian community leaders demanded on Friday that the air force be prosecuted for alleged attacks on their villages in the northeasterly state of Adamawa, which they say killed 78 people.
The human rights campaign group Amnesty International has said at least 35 people were killed in air raids in the region on Dec. 4. The Nigerian Air Force rejects the allegation, saying that it opened fire to dissuade looters and vandals, but did not target people. 
The allegations highlight some of Nigeria's security challenges, which have become politically charged less than a year before an election. President Muhammadu Buhari is touring affected areas, including the state where 110 schoolgirls were abducted last month, though he will not visit Adamawa.
Residents of the Adamawa villages described being fired upon by a fighter jet and military helicopter as they attempted to flee while, at the same time, hundreds of herdsmen were staging a revenge attack on the communities for earlier killings over grazing rights.
""We call for national and international criminal investigation in order to commence prosecution of those responsible for this crime,"" the representatives of six of the villages said in a joint statement. 
They said more than 78 people had been killed by Nigerian Air Force jets, and 20 by herdsmen. 
""We want the Nigerian Human Rights Commission and international community to know that the Nigerian Air Force excessively used force unlawfully in its air raids on our villages,"" read the statement, presented at a news conference in Adamawa's state capital, Yola. 
Following Amnesty's report, the air force denied it had bombed any locations in the region or fired at people. It said it was unaware of any human casualties.
""Our position remains as captured in our earlier response to Amnesty International,"" air force spokesman Olatokunbo Adesanya said on Friday. 
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is due in Nigeria next week for a visit expected to focus on security.
Nigeria is in the final stages of buying fighter planes from the United States. The deal was halted by the previous U.S. administration over concerns about the military's human rights record, but revived by the administration of President Donald Trump.

1467,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",Tanzania's Magufuli warns of crackdown on protesters,"DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzanian President John Magufuli warned on Friday of a crackdown on anyone who participates in illegal demonstrations, vowing not to let his economic reforms be derailed by street protests.
Magufuli, nicknamed ""the Bulldozer"" for his forceful leadership style, has introduced anti-corruption measures and tough economic reforms, including cuts to wasteful government spending, since taking office in November 2015.
""Some people have failed to engage in legitimate politics; they would like to see street protests everyday...Let them demonstrate and they will see who I am,"" he told a public gathering in northwestern Tanzania.
Critics say his cost-cutting measures and policy changes are excessive and undermine growth in East Africa's third-biggest economy by stifling foreign investment in critical sectors such as mining. Magufuli said the reforms were on course.
""We want to build a strong economy for all Tanzanians and we are on the right track. Let us be patient, Tanzania will become a land of honey,"" the president said. 
A senior police official said on Friday that security forces were on alert against street protests being organized via social media platforms.
A U.S.-based Tanzanian social media activist, Mange Kimambi, has called for nationwide anti-government demonstrations on April 26 to protest over a diminution of political freedoms and human rights abuses in his home country. 
Kimambi, who has a large youth following on social media, is rallying Tanzanians via Telegram chat groups to take to the streets after previous demonstrations called by the main opposition CHADEMA party in 2016 were called off.
In Tanzania, anyone wanting to stage a demonstration must inform police and receive a permit from them. Police have declared the Kimambi-led protest illegal and an act of treason. 
The United States, European Union and several Western embassies in Tanzania voiced concern last month over political violence and allegations of rights abuses.    
But the criticism is unlikely to hurt Magufuli's government politically, after the ruling CCM party won a majority in recent local government and parliamentary by-elections. 
The foreign affairs ministry dismissed the concerns of Western embassies as ""sensational, ill-informed and inciting"".

1468,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>","Tensions build in new, 'explosive' German coalition","By Paul Carrel
BERLIN (Reuters) - Fault lines are emerging in Germany's new government before ministers have even held their first cabinet meeting, with tensions over the sequencing and extent of reforms already pulling at the fragile coalition.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives only turned to the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) to prolong their 'grand coalition' out of desperation after talks on a three-way alliance with two smaller parties collapsed last November.
Their subsequent 177-page coalition deal, clinched last month after difficult negotiations, is peppered with the phrase ""We want to"", leaving plenty of leeway for disagreements over competing priorities.
""Pensions, healthcare, Europe and asylum and migration policy are all areas where there are explosives built into the coalition agreement,"" Detlef Seif, deputy EU spokesman for Merkel's conservative parliamentary bloc, told Reuters.
With more than five months gone since September's election, Merkel is keenly aware that voters expect the new government - which takes office on Wednesday - to address their economic, social and security concerns quickly.
""With our coalition agreement, we have a book full of assignments and tasks to implement,"" she said on Monday.
The pressure is on for both camps to deliver: the inclusion in the coalition deal of a clause that envisages a review of the government's progress after two years gives each the opportunity to leave the ruling alliance then if it is not working for them.
The priority the government gives to different reforms set out in the coalition deal, the extent to which it implements them, and the personnel involved promise a cocktail of pressures that Merkel will need all her political skill to balance.
The SPD only agreed to ally with Merkel after promising a list of distinctive policies to secure the approval of party members, many of whom wanted the SPD to regroup in opposition after voters gave it no credit for the last four years of governing under Merkel.
SOCIAL SPENDING
It wants in particular to move ahead with social reforms - increased child benefit and changes in health insurance and education spending.
The coalition agreement foresees 12 billion euros ($15 billion) of investment in family, child and social measures, a stabilization in pensions, curbs on employers' use of fixed-term contracts and a review of how healthcare is funded.
SPD leaders know they need some quick wins. One recent poll had the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) surpassing the SPD for the first time in a national survey to become the second-strongest party.
However, senior members of Merkel's conservative bloc - her Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) - feel Social Democrat policies got too high a priority in the last government.
Its first year saw the passage of a flagship pension reform to lower the retirement age and legislation to introduce a national minimum wage - both key SPD projects.
This time, the conservatives' parliamentary leader, Volker Kauder, says his group will not allow that to happen again.
""The CDU/CSU parliamentary group will ensure that for each SPD issue, a concern of the CDU and CSU will be put forward,"" Kauder said at a CDU party conference held to approve the coalition deal.
For the conservatives, taking a tougher line on immigration after the 2015 refugee crisis is a top priority, as is spending on domestic and foreign security.
""If there is room for maneuver in the budget, we won't forget the armed forces,"" Kauder said.
The coalition deal foresees additional fiscal space of 46 billion euros ($57 billion) over the next four years.
Any additional surplus is earmarked primarily for defense, development and crisis prevention, with spending to be split equally between military and non-military projects.
DEFENSE AND EUROPE
But SPD leaders are likely to be skeptical about any big jumps in the defense budget. They have also raised questions about the NATO target of moving toward spending 2 percent of gross domestic output on the military.
Should economic growth slow and tax revenues come in weaker than projected - a scenario that new U.S. trade tariffs could help to bring about - the social spending plans dear to the SPD could also be threatened.
The issue of European Union reform, given great prominence in the coalition deal under the heading 'A new start for Europe', also promises to be contentious.
The agreement echoed the SPD's vocal backing for French President Emmanuel Macron's reform initiative, which foresees creating a euro zone Finance Ministry and budget. In their document, the CDU/CSU and SPD offered support for budgetary means to shield the euro zone from crises and said Germany was prepared to pay more into EU finances - albeit still stressing Germany's commitment to the EU's strict budget rules.
""I suspect the Social Democrats' vision is considerably different to ours,"" said Seif of the CDU, who worried about German taxpayers' money being splashed about. ""We are not a debt or transfer union, and we don't want to become one.""
To clinch the coalition deal, Merkel gave up the finance ministry to the SPD - a surprise concession, considering that the conservatives defeated the SPD by 32.9 percent to 20.5 percent in September.
New Social Democrat finance minister Olaf Scholz promises to be a safe pair of hands whose budgets will in any case be overseen by parliament. 
But Scholz is close to Andrea Nahles, poised to take over as SPD leader in April in a move that will give the Social Democrats a significant platform outside the government.
Instead of becoming a minister, Nahles will lead the SPD's parliamentary party. A fierce debater with a common touch that Merkel lacks, Nahles promised after the election to ""smash in the face"" of the CDU.

""She's going to give Merkel a tough time,"" said Andrea Roemmele, professor at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. ($1 = 0.8133 euros)

1469,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>","In blow to minorities, Pakistani court orders citizens to declare religion","By Saad Sayeed
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani court ruled on Friday that all citizens must declare their religion when applying for identity documents, a move human rights advocates say is another blow for the country's persecuted minority communities. 
The ruling will pile further pressure on the Ahmadi community, who are not allowed to call themselves Muslim or use Islamic symbols in their religious practices, a crime punishable under Pakistan's blasphemy laws.
The Islamabad High Court ruled that citizens who disguised their religious affiliation were guilty of betraying the state and ordered that anyone applying for government jobs should declare their faith. 
""The Government of Pakistan shall take special measure ensuring availability of correct particulars of all the citizens,"" Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui said in the judgment.
""It should not be possible for any citizen to hide his/her real identity and recognition."" 
If no appeal is launched, the court's directives will have to be followed.
The vast majority of Pakistan's 208 million people are Muslims, with minorities accounting for about 3 percent of the population, according to a 1998 census.
The Ahmadi community has been a target of mob violence and attacks since legislation categorized the sect as non-Muslim in 1974 and have been vilified as blasphemers by leaders of new ultra-religious political party Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan.
The judge ""is not only attacking everybody's religious freedom in Pakistan but he is also focusing on one particular sect, which is the Ahmadis,"" said Human Rights Watch representative Saroop Ijaz.
""A judgment like this would enable and incite violence.""
The order was issued as a result of a petition brought forward by Tehreek-e-Labaik in connection with a change in wording to an electoral law. The amendment sought to replace a religious oath with a simple declaration, which Tehreek-e-Labaik said was blasphemy. 
The government blamed the change on a clerical error and swiftly restored the original format.
Last year, Tehreek-e-Labaik shut down the nation's capital for nearly three weeks with protests against the change.
Seven people were killed and nearly 200 wounded in a failed police bid to disperse protesters, leading the government to give way to their demand that a minister accused of blasphemy resign.
Insulting the Prophet Mohammad is punishable by death in Pakistan and even a rumor of blasphemy can spark mob violence. 
""All his (the judge's) specific instructions are about ensuring and finding out who is an Ahmadi,"" human rights lawyer Jibran Nasir told Reuters, adding that the order would automatically provide the government with specific lists about who belongs to which minority group. 
""Every day they are being institutionally reminded that they are a minority,"" he added. ""It is a bigoted order."" 

Pakistan's minority Shi'ite Muslims regularly come under attack by Islamist groups. Members of its small Hindu and Christian communities have also sometimes been accused of blasphemy.

Mission in the country, for failing to comply with media laws, the media regulator said on Friday.
Media outlets in South Sudan have increasingly come under threat and tight control from the regulator since it was established in 2016.
Elijah Alier Kuai, head of regulator South Sudan Media Authority, accused the station of ""persistent noncompliance and refusal to be regulated under media laws of South Sudan.""
He said the station had failed to respond to several queries over the years, including the violation of the terms of its broadcast license. He did not give further details.
The UN Mission in South Sudan's (UNMISS) spokesperson Francescal Molde said that they were discussing the issue with the government and that they were still on air.
""Radio Miraya is continuing to broadcast across the country,"" Molde said. 
The station provides news on the activities of various U.N. agencies to the public in South Sudan and political programs aimed at fostering peace.
South Sudan has been racked by an ethnically charged civil war since late 2013, pitting forces loyal to President Salva Kiir against rebels linked to former vice president Riek Machar.
Some local media organizations have been shut down over failure to observe the regulator's demands. Last year 20 foreign journalists were barred by the media authority from entering and reporting in the country.

1471,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 01:38PM ET</span>",Turkey's top court says journalist should get stiffer sentence,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's highest court overruled a five-year jail sentence against prominent journalist Can Dundar on Friday, saying he should instead face up to 20 years in prison on espionage charges, the state-run Anadolu agency said.
Dundar and a colleague from the Cumhuriyet newspaper, Erdem Gul, were both sentenced in 2016 to five years in prison for publishing a video purporting to show Turkey's intelligence agency trucking weapons into Syria. They were later released pending appeal.
On Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that the lower court should have sentenced Dundar on espionage-related charges, which carry a 15-20 year sentence, rather than the lesser charge of disclosing confidential information, Anadolu said. It said Gul should be acquitted due to lack of evidence.
Following his release, Dundar left Turkey and is now being tried in absentia. Gul remains in the country and is free while his appeal is in process.
For critics of President Tayyip Erdogan, Dundar has become a symbol of what they say is Turkey's sweeping crackdown on press freedom, especially since a failed coup in 2016. Turkish authorities have sacked or suspended 150,000 people and detained 50,000 on suspicion of involvement in, or support for, the coup.
""Real 'espionage' is the secret transfer of arms into a foreign country. Those who report on it are journalists,"" Dundar tweeted, in response to the report of the decision.
Dundar, in London for rehearsals of a play commissioned by the Royal Shakespeare Company about his life, dismissed the espionage charges as the Turkish government's latest attempt to punish him for his critical coverage of Erdogan.
""If there's a crime, it's not mine but the government's,"" he told Reuters, adding that he had not yet seen the ruling. 
Dundar said his wife, Dilek Dundar, continued to challenge Turkey's ban on her departure from the country, with her case now before Turkey's constitutional court.
Last month, Turkey sentenced six other journalists, including two prominent brothers, to life in jail for aiding plotters of the 2016 failed coup.
Mehmet Altan, an economics professor and journalist, and his brother Ahmet, also a journalist, were accused of giving coded messages on a television talk show a day before the abortive military putsch. Nazli Ilicak, another well-known journalist, was also among those sentenced. All six have denied the charges.

The government says its security measures are necessary given the multiple threats it faces.

An Israeli military spokesman said the man had been about to throw a fire-bomb at the troops, who were responding to an immediate threat when they shot him. He added that the incident in the city of Hebron would be reviewed.
U.S.-led peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014 and a new push by President Donald Trump's administration to restart negotiations has shown little progress so far.
Tensions between the sides have risen since Trump declared on Dec. 6 that he recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Outraged Palestinian leaders said Washington could no longer take the lead in peace efforts but Israel has said the United States should remain peace-broker. 
Trump's announcement and the planned move in May of the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem - home to sites holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians - reversed decades of U.S. policy on the city. Its status is one of the biggest obstacles to reaching a peace agreement.

The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state. Israel says the entire city is its indivisible, and eternal capital.

Pravind Jugnauth, the prime minister, told reporters Gurib-Fakim would resign after March 12, after the celebration of the country's 50th anniversary.
He did not comment on the row over credit card expenditure but he has previously said everyone should shoulder their responsibility, when asked about the issue by reporters.
Gurib-Fakim, a chemistry professor, was appointed to the largely ceremonial post in 2015, as the island nation's first female president, has denied any wrongdoing and said she had refunded all the money in question.

CHAKMAKUL REFUGEE CAMP, Bangladesh (Reuters) - The Rohingya refugees who live in shacks clinging to these steep, denuded hills in southern Bangladesh pray that the sandbags fortifying the slopes will survive the upcoming monsoon.
""They make it safer, but they won't hold if the rain is really heavy,"" said Mohammed Hares, 18. Cracks have already formed in the packed mud on which his shack is built.
Nearly 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh since last August to escape a military crackdown in neighboring Myanmar. Most now live in flimsy, bamboo-and-plastic structures perched on what were once forested hills.
Bangladesh is lashed by typhoons, and the Rohingya camps are clustered in a part of the country that records the highest rainfall. Computer modeling by the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) shows that more than 100,000 refugees will be threatened by landslides and floods in the coming monsoon. 
The rains typically begin in April and peak in July, according to the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. 
In Kutupalong-Balukhali, the biggest of the makeshift camps, up to a third of the land could be flooded, leaving more than 85,000 refugees homeless, according to the UNHCR. Another 23,000 refugees live on slopes at risk of landslide.
The UNHCR, International Organization for Migration (IOM) and World Food Programme are using bulldozers to level 123 acres in northern Kutupalong-Balukhali camp in an effort to make the area safer, said UNHCR spokeswoman Caroline Gluck. 
IOM is putting debris-removal equipment and work crews throughout the camps, it said, and trying to improve roads and stabilize slopes. It is also setting up emergency diarrhoea treatment centers and providing search and rescue and first aid training.
Bangladesh Disaster Management Secretary Shah Kamal said the government was working with the UN to relocate 133,000 people living in high-risk areas. It is also launching a Rohingya-language radio station that will act as a natural disaster warning system, he said.
Bangladesh government officials have also previously told Reuters they are pushing ahead with a controversial plan to turn an uninhabited island in the Bay of Bengal into a temporary home for the Rohingya and move 100,000 refugees there ahead of the monsoon.
Flooding increases the risk of disease outbreaks. It could also threaten access to medical facilities, making them difficult to reach and restock, the modeling shows. Latrines, washrooms and tube wells may also be flooded. 
The risk of landslides has been exacerbated by refugee families needing firewood to cook. Trees were cut down to make way for the refugees, who also dug up the roots for firewood, making the slopes even weaker and prone to collapse. 
""This was a forest when I first arrived,"" said Arafa Begum, 40, who lives with her three children in a shack on a barren, vertiginous slope in Chakmakul camp. She said she wanted to move before the monsoon but must await the instructions of the majhi, or block leader.
The majhi's name is Jahid Hussain. ""I don't know what I'll do when the rain comes,"" he told Reuters. ""It depends on Allah.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - The United States is missing out on a global boom for tourism, hurt by a so-called Trump slump and currency exchange rates, travel industry experts said at a gathering in Berlin this week. 
While U.S. President Donald Trump maintains that the travel ban blocking visitors from nations including Iran, Libya and Syria is needed to protect the United States from Islamic militants, the bans have raised concerns over America's image as a welcoming country, with data showing a decline in tourist numbers last year.
International arrivals to the United States were down 4 percent in the first three quarters of 2017, Trump's first year in office, according to the most recent data available from the United States.
By comparison, international tourism arrivals worldwide in 2017 were up 7 percent, representing the strongest result in seven years, figures from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) show.
""Politics is not helping us,"" said Tilo Krause-Duenow, owner of German tour operator CANUSA, which specializes in trips to North America.
""The potential for the U.S. could be much bigger. Prices have come down due to the currency weakening and we should have seen a much bigger increase in demand,"" he told Reuters at the ITB travel fair in Berlin.
German market researcher Gfk says that bookings from Germany to the United States are down 20 percent for the 2018 summer season, though it said this could be down to factors such as last year's hurricane season and foreign exchange rates as well as the Trump effect.
Flight bookings to the United States fell 2 percent in 2017 and were flat in the first two months of 2018, a report by travel analysis company ForwardKeys showed this week. The report cited a weaker British pound, which makes it more expensive for Britons to travel abroad, and Trump's travel ban.
America's hopes of improving its reputation as a foreigner-friendly destination look to have been dented further this week, with Trump's imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs on Thursday raising fears of an international trade war.
SPENDING POWER
New York had initially predicted a decline in international visitors by 300,000 for 2017 after Trump took office but now expects a smaller decline of about 100,000 to roughly 12.6 million.
""We're still concerned because it takes the spending power of four domestic travelers to equal the spending power of one international traveler,"" said Christopher Heywood, spokesman for New York City's official tourism organization NYC & Company.
One area of optimism is ForwardKeys data showing that international forward bookings to the United States from within the Americas over the next six months are up 7 percent, but bookings from elsewhere have crept up by only 0.5 percent.
Some travel operators, however, say the concerns are overblown.
Arnaud Devanlay, of Evaneos, a website that offers tailor-made tours, said people had been concerned in the early part of last year but then decided to travel anyway. 
""They're visiting a country, not a government,"" he said. 
Delta Air Lines' (N:DAL) sales director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, meanwhile, says that recent weakness in the dollar will help to lift demand. 
""People want to go where they get the most for their money, where they feel safe and there's exciting things to see,"" Delta's Bob Hannah said. 

""And Trump's not going to stop that.""

The two high-profile activists were among 154 signatories of an open letter to the Washington and Ottawa governments urging them to reconsider recent measures to pressure President Nicolas Maduro's administration. 
The United States and Canada have slapped individual sanctions on a handful of Venezuelan officials, including Maduro, over accusations of corruption, democratic abuses and human rights violations.
The measures include freezing assets and preventing U.S. and Canadian nationals from dealing with them. The U.S. government has also imposed financial measures, intended to stop Venezuela from contracting new debt, and is considering oil sanctions.
While critics say sanctions are aimed only at Venezuela's ""dictatorship"", Maduro says they are part of an international right-wing conspiracy intended to topple him and take control of the OPEC nation's oil wealth. 
""We are deeply concerned by the use of illegal sanctions, whose effect falls most heavily on the poorest and most marginal sectors of society, to coerce political and economic change in a sister democracy,"" the letter said. 
""Sanctions merely complicate efforts by the Vatican, Dominican Republic, and other international actors to mediate a resolution to the deep polarization in Venezuela."" 
Former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez used to enjoy high-profile support from a raft of leftist personalities, but his successor Maduro has seen foreign opinion harden against him, particularly during opposition protests last year.
""It is no secret that Venezuela -- unlike Mexico, Honduras, Colombia, Egypt, or Saudi Arabia -- is targeted for regime change by the U.S. precisely because of Venezuela's leadership in resisting U.S. hegemony and the imposition of the neo-liberal model in Latin America,"" the activists' letter said. 
Opposition supporters say Western celebrities are ingenuous in supporting Venezuela's leftist government without understanding how its policies have spawned malnutrition, disease, and mass emigration.

""The incident constituted a kidnapping and is a dangerous precedent and a severe violation of international norms,"" it added.
There was no immediate comment from the Emirati authorities.
Mediation efforts, including by the United States, have failed to resolve the dispute, though Washington hopes to make progress before hosting a Gulf Cooperation Council summit later this year.

Rosatom is looking at four Turkish companies as possible partners, but little progress has been made so far, said one of the sources, both of whom declined to be identified because the information is not yet public.
Rosatom said last month it was in talks with state-owned power producer EUAS after a deal with a consortium of three firms collapsed.
""Concrete progress has not been made in the talks so far, and this includes EUAS from the government side,"" one source said, adding that Rosatom was keen to have a government entity such as EUAS as a shareholder.
Rosatom is looking for Turkish partners to take a 49 percent stake in the planned Akkuyu nuclear plant in southern Turkey.
But the government is wary of EUAS taking on the 49 percent stake by itself. 
""A 49 percent stake still means $10 billion of funding even if it's spread over years,"" the source said. ""It is a very big project, there are many details and issues that need to be worked on. We can't expect this to be resolved soon.""
The project is to be financed by Rosatom and its partners and will involve loans from export-import agencies and banks, Anastasia Polovinkina, director of Rosatom affiliate Rusatom Energy International told a conference in June 2017.
FINANCING
The 4,800 megawatt Akkuyu plant is a intended to reduce Turkey's dependence on energy imports but has been beset by delays since Russia was awarded the contract in 2010.
But Turkish companies have been put off by the size of the financing required as well as by concerns they will not receive a sufficient share of the lucrative construction side of the deal, two industry sources said. 
The firms are also worried that the guaranteed electricity price could eventually be lowered, reducing future revenue, they said. 
Rosatom did not respond to a request for comment. Officials for EUAS and the government declined to comment.
Rosatom last year said it would sell 49 percent of Akkuyu Nukleer AS, the company which will build and operate the plant, to a consortium made up of Kolin Insaat, Kalyon Insaat and Cengiz Holding - Turkish firms that have been awarded major infrastructure projects under Erdogan.
However, the final agreement was never signed and Rosatom said Kolin and Kalyon had decided to pull out of the project.
Cengiz remains as a contractor and Rosatom said last month that the two were in talks regarding other ""partnership options"". 
Rosatom has said it expects to find new investors for the project this year, adding that could be a single investor for the entire 49 percent or several firms taking smaller stakes. 
At a November news conference with Erdogan, Russian President Vladimir Putin re-affirmed the 2023 launch for the plant's first reactor, and said construction would begin in the near future.
However, Rosatom has still not received a full construction licence from Turkey's atomic energy authority.
""Construction time for the plant is seven years. Even if it receives the licence today, the 2023 target is not very realistic,"" one of the sources familiar with the matter said.

1482,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 09:01AM ET</span>",Romanian ruling party chief under investigation in Brazil-report,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - The leader of Romania's ruling Social Democrats and speaker of its lower house of parliament, Liviu Dragnea, is under investigation in Brazil on suspicion of money laundering, a Brazilian prosecutor was quoted on Friday as saying.
An online investigative reporting platform, Rise Project, quoted Brazilian federal prosecutor Carlos Wagner Barbosa Guimaraes as saying Brazilian authorities were investigating whether Dragnea and others had used ill-gotten funds to buy beach properties in the country through third parties.
Asked about the report, Dragnea, who keeps a tight grip on his party and is seen as effectively in charge of Romania's government, said it was false.
""We talked about this topic in 2017. They (Rise Project) have reheated the soup, but I am not eating it,"" said Dragnea, who is barred from becoming Romania's prime minister by a suspended jail sentence imposed on him in a vote rigging case.
Rise Project, which is a member of the cross-border Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project of investigative journalists, also quoted Barbosa Guimaraes as saying the Brazilian investigation had started after Romanian prosecutors had asked for help in mid-2017.
Dragnea is currently on trial in Romania in an abuse of office case and is also under investigation in a separate case on suspicion of forming a criminal group to siphon off cash from state projects, some of them EU-funded..
Dragnea has denied all charges of wrongdoing, including in the earlier vote rigging case, where he said the verdict was politically motivated.
Transparency International ranks Romania among the European Union's most corrupt states. Brussels, which keeps Romania's justice system under special monitoring, has praised magistrates for their efforts to curb graft.
At the start of 2017, attempts by the ruling coalition to weaken anti-corruption legislation triggered Romania’s biggest protests in decades.

Prime Minister Viktor Orban's nationalist Fidesz, in power for eight years and at odds with the European Union on a range of issues, remains well ahead of its rivals in opinion polls, campaigning on a tough anti-immigrant agenda that also promises increased state spending on wages and pensions.
But Gergely Gulyas, leader of Fidesz' parliamentary group, told magazine Hetek in an interview that his party was unlikely to win two thirds of seats as in the 2010 and 2014 elections, partly due to the sheer length of time it has now held power.
""Our clear goal is to form a government. A hundred mandates are enough for this. Everything that comes above that is a much-valued gift,"" Gulyas was cited as saying in the interview.
""I may be too pessimistic, but I regard a two-thirds victory unlikely.""
Gulyas also ruled out Fidesz entering into a coalition with other parties if it fails to secure a majority in the election.
""Today I cannot see any possibilities for a coalition. If a stable government cannot be formed, then sooner or later there will be early elections.""
""Preserving Hungary's stability... is at stake in the election,"" he added.
Despite its domination of Hungarian politics and the continued weakness of the opposition, Fidesz was taken off guard by the victory of an opposition-backed independent over its candidate in a by-election on Feb. 25.
Earlier this week Orban announced generous pre-election handouts to millions of families and pensioners in an attempt to shore up support among voters.
His government has also stepped up its anti-migrant rhetoric in recent weeks, vilifying U.S. financier and philanthropist George Soros, whom it accuses of wanting to bring millions of migrants into Europe. Soros denies this.
The Orban government has launched a nationwide billboard campaign with the message: ""The U.N. wants us to accept migrants on a continuous basis. HUNGARY DECIDES, NOT THE U.N.!""

Despite Gulyas's comments, there is little sign yet of the opposition parties - which include the nationalist Jobbik, the Socialists and smaller left-leaning liberal parties - forming a common nationwide front against Fidesz.

1484,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 10:29AM ET</span>",Spanish court says proposed Catalan leader must stay in jail,"By Raquel Castillo and Jesús Aguado
MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's Supreme Court on Friday turned down a request by Catalan regional presidential candidate Jordi Sanchez to be allowed out of jail to attend a parliamentary session to swear in a new leader, in a further blow to the region's bid to split from Spain.
Catalonia's parliament is expected to meet on Monday to vote on the region's new leader. Sanchez was put forward as a candidate by secessionist parties as a substitute for Carles Puigdemont, the movement's figurehead.
Sanchez is in jail awaiting trial on charges of rebellion and sedition over his role in orchestrating pro-independence protests last year during which national police were trapped inside a Barcelona building and their vehicles destroyed.
Spain's central government swept in to take control of the northeastern region after it declared independence in October in an act courts said was illegal and against the country's constitution. 
The government called regional elections in an attempt to derail the independence movement, but the move backfired when parties favoring a split from Spain won the most parliamentary seats.
However, with many senior secessionist figures in jail or self-imposed exile in Belgium, the parliament is struggling to elect a head and start governing.
Former regional head Puigdemont, in Brussels since October, withdrew his bid for a second term in office on March 1.
The new candidate, Sanchez, had asked the judge handling his case for permission to leave prison to attend Monday's parliamentary session in Barcelona.
In a 26-page ruling, Spanish judge Pablo Llarena based his decision not to let Sanchez out on his belief there was a risk of a repeat offence.
A Catalan parliament spokesman said Monday's parliamentary session would still go ahead.

On Friday, the Spanish government's spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo reiterated that any candidate put forward to lead Catalonia should not be in jail or under judicial investigation.

PARIS (Reuters) - French voters are happy with Emmanuel Macron's plans to shrink parliament and scrap perks enjoyed by 150,000 railway workers, but less pleased by the president's effort to make car drivers slow down, polls show.
As the 40-year-old prepares a constitutional change to lower the number of lawmakers in the two houses of parliament by up to a third, an Odoxa poll on Friday showed nine in 10 people like the idea, one of a myriad of reforms in the pipeline.
 Polls over the last couple of weeks also show around six in 10 voters back his government's plans to wean staff at the debt-ridden SNCF state railway off age-old perks such as job-for-life contracts, free train tickets and early retirement.  That reform has sparked warnings of industrial action from labor unions who will decide on March 15 whether to call for a strike. The red light for Macron, whose popularity rating is at its lowest since his election in May 2017, comes from plans to lower the speed limit on the 400,000 km (250,000 miles) of France's secondary road network. Despite a rise in road accidents since 2014, 59 percent of voters questioned in polls oppose the proposal to reduce the top speed on nearly all two-lane roads outside built-up areas from 90 to 80 km (50 mph) per hour.  That would put France on a par with Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands, where limits are among the lowest in Europe.  A campaign against the speed-limit change has enlisted backing from scores of regional political leaders who argue it is a ""made-in-Paris"" reform that ignores rural realities such as varying road standards and lack of public transport. Within Macron's own political party, some are worried by a change that prompted politicians from one in four of France's administrative departments to publish a joint appeal for a rethink. ""I'm against this and I would have voted against it, had it been a proposal in parliament,"" Francois Jolivet, a member of parliament for Macron's LREM party, told France 2 TV this week. A government spokesman said this week the change, which the government says could cut the annual road death toll by 350-400 from 3,500 in 2017, should come into effect in July as planned. Nine months into Macron's five-year tenure, his own approval rating has slipped in the most recent polls to 43-44 percent.

1486,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 08:10AM ET</span>",Colombia's FARC trades bombs for ballots in congressional vote,"By Luis Jaime Acosta
FUSAGASUGA, Colombia (Reuters) - Four years ago, when Colombia last held congressional elections, Carlos Antonio Lozada was dodging army bullets in jungle trenches as he and his Marxist rebel comrades battled a government offensive. 
Back then he wore camouflage fatigues emblazoned with the emblem of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) - two crossed rifles over the nation's red, blue and yellow flag. 
Now, as a 56-year-old candidate for the Senate in Sunday's elections, Lozada no longer brandishes an automatic assault rifle and the FARC emblem has become a red rose on a white background. 
The Spanish-language acronym now stands for the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force, the political party the rebel group established after a peace deal was signed in 2016.
As Colombia adjusts to the end of Latin America's longest-running armed conflict, the FARC is pitching its defense of the poor and other proposals to a traditionally conservative electorate, divided between those who accept its new role in politics and those who demand its leaders go to jail.
""We're learning to go to public squares and seek massive support for our ideas with arguments and proposals,"" Lozada told Reuters, speaking at the close of his campaign for Sunday's vote. 
From the stage in Fusagasuga, an agricultural town close to the capital, the former rebel commander outlined the FARC's plans for social change to some 200 flag-waving supporters and the curious.
""This is what we bet on when we signed the (peace) agreements,"" said Lozada, who served 39 years as a rebel fighter. 
As part of the peace deal, the FARC will be guaranteed five seats each in the 108-member Senate and the 172-member lower house. But polls show it faces an uphill battle in the fight for open congressional seats.
The FARC has also expressed concern about the safety of its candidates, after many were pelted on the campaign trail with tomatoes, bottles and eggs by angry protesters.
Patriotic Union, a political party founded by the FARC and Colombian Communist Party in the 1980s, was decimated by a campaign of violent attacks and assassinations blamed on right-wing death squads and drug lords.
The new FARC suffered a setback on Thursday when Rodrigo Londono, its candidate for the May 27 presidential race and known by his nom de guerre Timochenko, withdrew due to ill health. The party said it would not seek a replacement.
HEALTH, EDUCATION, CORRUPTION
Colombia's five-decade conflict and subsequent peace accord dominated elections in 2014. Now, candidates are focusing on health, education, corruption, the economy and closing the chasm between rich and poor in the country of 50 million people.
Sunday's ballot will include party primaries to select the candidates who will compete in May's election to replace outgoing center-right President Juan Manuel Santos.
It is unclear if Londono's exit from the race will help give a boost to Gustavo Petro, a prominent leftist and former member of the now-defunct socialist M-19 rebel movement. 
But polls show Petro will almost certainly emerge as a candidate from Sunday's primary and his political rise, after serving earlier as Bogota's mayor, stands out as something of an example for the FARC.
The 57-year-old economist and former senator was granted amnesty after serving two years in jail for his involvement with the M-19 insurgency. 
Supporters of Petro's ""Colombia Humana"" party highlight his work to improve conditions for the poor. He has pledged to create a ""social economy"" at the service of the people and shift it away from oil toward agriculture. A strong showing in Sunday's election will likely worry markets. 
""If voter turnout for the left-wing primary is close to the center-right coalition's primary, this could consolidate Petro's bid for the presidency,"" Citibank said in a note to investors. ""A lukewarm turnout could lead Petro to lose steam.""
On the right, Ivan Duque, a young senator with backing from former President Alvaro Uribe, looks set to notch a win over Marta Lucia Ramirez, a former defense minister, in Sunday's primary.
Duque, 41, of Uribe's Democratic Center party, is a lawyer and senator who studied at Georgetown University before working at the Inter-American Development Bank and United Nations.
While some are concerned by his lack of political experience and say Uribe will pull the strings if he wins, investors welcome Duque's pledges to streamline the tax code and levy companies depending on their size.

1488,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 07:41AM ET</span>",Thousands set to protest as Slovak political crisis builds,"BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Thousands of Slovaks were expected to take to the streets on Friday for the second mass protest in a week, as pressure builds on Prime Minister Robert Fico in the wake of a journalist's murder.
Slovakia has been plunged into crisis by the death of investigative reporter Jan Kuciak, who had probed fraud cases involving politically-connected businessmen and whose last report looked at Italian businessmen in Slovakia with suspected mafia links.
One of the businessmen, who has denied having ties to the Italian mafia, had dealings in the past with two people who later went on to work in Fico's office. They have both resigned and deny any connection with the murder.
The case has stoked public anger over corruption allegations and threatens to break up Fico's three-party government. 
The prime minister was due on Friday to meet President Andrej Kiska, who has urged a government revamp or early elections to rebuild public trust. 
The prime minister also plans talks on Monday with the Most-Hid party in his coalition, which has called for the sacking of Interior Minister Robert Kalinak, a close ally of Fico. 
""This crisis is different than those that Fico has weathered in the past,"" Martin Slosiarik, an analyst at Focus polling agency, said. 
""Kuciak's last story has had a serious impact on people's trust in the system of government and the murder of two young people has added a strong moral aspect.""
Fico is midway through his third term as prime minister, and has led the central European country for 10 of the last 12 years. Slovakia has prospered in the past decade, but many see him as having failed to fight graft and cronyism.
A week ago, about 20,000 people marched for Kuciak in the capital Bratislava and thousands more in other cities. Organizers said at least 20,000 were planning to turn out in several cities on Friday.
Protest organizers are demanding a thorough investigation of Kuciak's death and for Fico, Interior Minister Kalinak and the police chief to step aside.
Fico has fought back in the last week, suggesting foreign forces are trying to destabilize the country. He has asked why President Kiska met financier George Soros in New York last year without any foreign ministry official present.

The comments on Soros echo those of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has accused the Hungarian-born billionaire of interfering in Hungarian politics by supporting opposition groups.

1490,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",Austria plans to put immigration and borders at heart of EU presidency,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria plans to use its presidency of the European Union this year to shift the bloc's focus away from resettling refugees within the EU and towards preventing further waves of arrivals, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Friday.
Kurz is governing in coalition with the anti-immigration Freedom Party, making Austria the only western European country to have a far-right party in government. This follows an election last year dominated by Europe's migration crisis.
Austria will take over the rotating six-month presidency of the European Union in July, giving it an important say in setting the agenda at the many meetings between member states.
The bloc has been bitterly divided over immigration and eastern member states like Poland and Hungary refuse to take in their share of refugees under a resettlement system. Kurz, an immigration hard-liner, has pledged to use his good relations particularly with Hungary to bring the two sides closer.
""Our aim is very clear - that in Europe there should not only be a dispute over redistribution (of refugees) but also at last a shift of focus towards securing external borders,"" Kurz told a news conference outlining Austria's priorities for the presidency, which it will take over from Bulgaria.
Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic have repeatedly rebuffed requests from Brussels and western EU states to host some of the hundreds of thousands of mostly Muslim refugees that have streamed into the EU since 2015.
The bitter row has undermined trust between the bloc's members and weakened their unity.
Austria has moved from calling on the eastern Europeans to carry their share of the burden to, under Kurz, criticizing the debate on quotas and calling for a new system altogether. 
Kurz has said there is no point arguing over the current system of quotas because eastern states refuse to accept them. He has argued in favor of a system in which migrants rescued in the Mediterranean are returned to Africa rather than brought to Europe, and pledged to stop illegal immigration altogether.
""Protection (of borders) alone will not solve the migration question but the decisive question is what happens to people after their rescue - so are they brought to central Europe or are they taken back to countries or origin or other safe regions where they can be provided for?"" he said.
When asked what solutions he had in mind, he said expanding the mandate of Frontex, the EU border agency, was one option but there were others and it would depend on talks with leaders at events including a summit on migration and security on Sept. 20.
Other priorities Austria has set itself include promoting Europe's competitiveness and working towards EU accession for Balkan countries, particularly Serbia and Montenegro, he said.
Kurz added that he also hoped the bloc would make progress on ensuring internet companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) pay more tax on profits in the countries where those profits are made, he said.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar authorities on Friday visited a suspected shallow grave in the country's north that residents said contained the bodies of two ethnic minority men who were detained by soldiers in January, a police officer and a community leader said.
The missing men had been living in camps for people displaced by conflict. More than 100,000 people have been forced from their homes since a ceasefire between Myanmar's armed forces and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) broke down in 2011.
The conflict is separate to the Rohingya crisis in the west of the country, but security forces are similarly accused of committing frequent abuses against civilians.
A group of about two dozen civilians discovered the remains on Thursday while searching in a forest in Kachin State's Mansi township for the men who went missing on Jan. 31, said Aung Myu San, a Kachin youth leader.
Police, a doctor, a judge and a local administrator were visiting the site on Friday afternoon, Aung Myu San told Reuters by phone from Maing Hkawng, a village roughly 30 km (18 miles) from Myanmar's border with China.
Second-Lieutenant Myo Thant, the police chief for Mansi, said he was visiting the site to investigate.
""We got the report for that. I am in the middle of the meeting to discuss going there,"" he said, adding he could not yet confirm what had been found. 
Campaign group Fortify Rights said on Feb. 20 it had spoken to two witnesses who saw soldiers detain Hpaugan Yaw, 65, and Nhkum Naw San, 35. The witnesses said Nhkum Naw San was badly beaten, and one said she saw soldiers try to put KIA uniforms on the men, according to the group, which kept the witnesses anonymous.
Khon Ja, a coordinator with the Kachin Peace Network civil society group, said there was a pattern of ""abduction and murder"" by security forces in the Kachin conflict.
""When the institution responsible for people’s lives and security is committing that kind of thing, civilians are helpless,"" she said, adding she was concerned about the safety of those who had reported military involvement in the men's disappearance.
Fortify Rights called for Myanmar to investigate and hold anyone found responsible to account in the case of the two Kachin men.
""These men were farmers, not fighters,"" said David Baulk, a researcher for the group. ""They were doing what they could to survive while displaced by conflict. They were in the wrong place at the wrong time, and paid with their lives.""
Reuters was unable to reach two spokesmen for the Myanmar military, General Soe Naing Oo and Major General Aye Lwin, to comment on the case.
Security forces are also accused of rape, murder and arson of Muslim Rohingya in a campaign launched in response to insurgent attacks in August in the western Rakhine state, prompting hundreds of thousands to flee to neighboring Bangladesh. 
Myanmar has asked for ""clear evidence"" of atrocities in Rakhine, but the U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein on Friday called for Myanmar to be referred to the International Criminal Court for what he said may be ""acts of genocide"" against the stateless Rohingya minority.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A one-time rising star in South Korea's ruling party, who quit his political post this week hours after an aide accused him of sexual assault, apologized on Friday in his first public appearance since the accusations emerged.
The downfall of An Hee-jung, who was governor of South Chungcheong province and a hopeful in last year's presidential election, comes as the #MeToo movement against sexual assault and harassment has taken off in the male-dominated society. 
""I'm sorry. I was wrong. I apologize to many people hurt by me. I'm really sorry to my wife and children,"" An told reporters at a prosecutors' office.
An's aide, who accused him of sexual misconduct in a television interview, filed a complaint with prosecutors this week, her lawyer's office said earlier.
The lawyer was not immediately available for comment.
An said he would fully cooperate with the prosecutors' investigation.
An, who had been seen as a future candidate for the presidency, has announced his retirement from politics having taken responsibility, in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post, for his actions.
Discussion of sexual misconduct has long been taboo in South Korea but in recent months the #MeToo movement has snowballed, ensnaring a number of high-profile figures across various fields, from the entertainment industry to the religious community and literary world.
On Friday, an actor and university professor, Cho Min-ki, who was also facing harassment allegations, was found dead, according to a hospital official.
The Yonhap News Agency reported that Cho was suspected to have committed suicide. Police said they were investigating.
Cho stepped down from his teaching position and left a role in a new television series after facing harassment allegations, according to an official at the actor's former talent agency. [nL4N1QG27N]
President Moon Jae-in has thrown his support behind the campaign against sexual assault and harassment and urged tough action against wrongdoing.

LONDON/RIYADH (Reuters) - Britain and Saudi Arabia took a step closer to a multi-billion- pound arms deal on Friday, touching on the most inflammatory element of their relationship at the end of an official visit to London that has mixed warm diplomacy with angry street protests.
The two countries also said they had made trade deals worth more than $2 billion, without providing details.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been in the British capital for three days on a mission to build broader trade and investment ties, meeting Queen Elizabeth, Prime Minister Theresa May, key ministers and executives. 
The countries signed a letter of intent to finalise talks on a multi-billion-pound order for 48 Typhoon aircraft made by BAE Systems (LON:BAES). The deal has been under discussion for years but has proven tough to seal.
""The Crown Prince's visit has opened a new chapter in our two countries' historic relationship,"" British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said. 
""We have taken a vital step towards finalising another order for Typhoon jets that will increase security in the Middle East and boost British industry and jobs in our unrivalled aerospace sector,"" he said.
Britain and Saudi Arabia have set themselves a 65 billion- pound ($90 billion) trade and investment target for the coming years, with London looking for new post-Brexit markets for its services sector, and Prince Mohammed seeking to convince wary investors his country is a tolerant and modernising place.
But for now the heart of bilateral trade ties remains defence and security. Britain credits Saudi intelligence-sharing with saving British lives and has licensed billions of pounds of weapons and ammunition sales to Saudi Arabia. 
That has provided a controversial backdrop to the warm diplomatic welcome for Prince Mohammed, with hundreds turning out on Wednesday to protest arms sales and Saudi Arabia's role in Yemen's civil war.
Prime Minister May defended the two countries' defence ties on Wednesday, saying all arms sales were strictly regulated.
The deal for the Typhoon fighters has become bogged down in negotiations over where production of the jet will take place, with Saudi Arabia keen to have some parts of the process on Saudi soil.
""If agreed, this shameful deal will be celebrated in the palaces of Riyadh and by the arms companies who will profit from it, but it will mean even greater destruction for the people of Yemen,"" said Andrew Smith of the Campaign Against Arms Trade. 
PUBLIC RELATIONS
Despite an unusual advertising blitz that saw adverts promoting Prince Mohammed and Saudi Arabia appear in national newspapers and on taxis and electronic billboards across London, the visit was knocked from the British front pages by the poisoning of a Russian double agent.
Prince Mohammed's itinerary was largely private, including meetings with bankers, executives and lawmakers, and he did not speak publicly at any point during the trip. 
But, in Riyadh, images of the 32-year old Saudi meeting the Christian cross-wearing head of the Anglican church on Thursday dominated newspapers, with headlines citing it as an example of the conservative kingdom's more tolerant approach to religion. 
An image of the heir-apparent striding up Downing Street towards May's office was lauded by Saudis on social media as emblematic of his youth, confidence, determination and enthusiasm.
The thorny topic of Yemen was on the agenda at a private dinner at May's country residence on Thursday night, but it was tempered with gifts: May's office said she presented Prince Mohammed with a family tree showing the descent of the Al Saud dynasty.
Downing Street said the framed document was originally created by Queen Victoria's consul general in Jeddah in 1880.
The two countries pledged 100 million pounds of joint funding to support economic growth in the Horn of Africa and East Africa, the joint statement said.

A deal on the thorny issue of who gets to appoint bishops could be signed within months, a senior Vatican source told Reuters in February. The potential Vatican rapprochement with Communist China sparked a war of words between Catholic officials.
""Talks are progressing at full swing,"" deputy head of the official Chinese Catholics association, Fang Jianping, told Reuters on the sidelines of the annual meeting of parliament, when asked about the prospect of a normalization of relations.
China's 12 million Catholics are split between ""underground"" communities that often recognize the pope and those registered with the state-controlled Catholic Patriotic Association, where bishops are appointed by the government in collaboration with local Church communities.
Fang said national policy was very positive towards the development of Catholicism in China. He did not elaborate.
A deal would allow the Church to care for China's Catholics and to focus on expanding a Catholic presence in a country where Protestant churches are growing quickly.
China has said it is sincere in its efforts to improve relations with the Vatican.
Last December, a Vatican delegation went to China to discuss the status of two Vatican-recognized bishops, including the possibility of allowing one prelate to retire and be succeeded by a state-backed bishop.
There is also a potential ""gentleman's agreement"" for seven government-backed bishops to be recognized by the Vatican after seeking a papal pardon, but this has not yet been formalized, the Vatican source told Reuters in February.
Cardinal Joseph Zen, however, the outspoken former bishop of Hong Kong, criticized news of progress towards a deal at the time, saying the Vatican was ""selling out"" the Catholic Church in China and suggested that there was discord between the pontiff and Vatican diplomats doing groundwork in China.
The Vatican has said that the Church is unified in its approach to China.

1499,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>","In Congo, voting machines raise suspicions among president's foes","By Aaron Ross and David Lewis
DAKAR/NAIROBI (Reuters) - When election officials unveiled voting machines that resemble large tablet computers in Democratic Republic of Congo, they hailed them as the solution to a multitude of problems. 
The new technology, they said, would cut costs, help reduce electoral fraud and accelerate the counting of votes in the vast central African country where past elections have been marred by voting irregularities or violence.
The national election commission (CENI) sees the voting machines as vital for holding long-delayed elections on Dec. 23 that will choose a successor to President Joseph Kabila, who refused to step down when his mandate expired in December 2016.
It proved an inauspicious start. The voting machine, imported from South Korea, broke down when it was demonstrated to a parliamentary commission in the capital, Kinshasa, a member of the committee told Reuters.
""If we have these problems in Kinshasa, what hope is there for the rest of the country?"" said the committee member, parliamentarian Toussaint Alonga.
One of the machines also malfunctioned during a presentation to two opposition parties last month, the parties' leaders said.
The parties, the Union for the Congolese Nation and Movement for the Liberation of Congo, later issued a joint statement saying they rejected the machines' use.
The election commission says the election will not go ahead without the new technology. Kabila's opponents fear it will cause chaos and increase the risk of fraud or voting irregularities that could lead to protests and violence.
They fear the president is looking for a pretext to delay the election until he can organize a referendum that would let him seek a new term, as leaders have done in neighboring Congo Republic and Rwanda.
Western governments and investors regard the election as a crucial step towards ending political instability that is impeding investment in Congo, which is rich in natural resources but mired in poverty and economic and humanitarian crises.
With the new technology, votes are cast by tapping the names of candidates listed on a screen. The voting machine then prints a ballot paper with those choices, sparing the need to pre-print large ballots with the names and photos of dozens of candidates.
The technology has never been used in a major election and doubts about the reliability of Congo's power supply and the machines' functionality in the sweltering heat have increased fears that voting will be marred by chaos.
Brushing aside the concerns, the election commission plans to roll out roughly 100,000 of the voting machines in Congo, which is the size of western Europe, on voting day. 
Prime Minister Bruno Tshibala, whose transitional ""unity"" government is organizing the election, told Reuters this week that Congo was still on course to hold the election on Dec. 23.
PEACEFUL TRANSITION? 
Much is at stake for the oil-producing country of about 80 million which has the largest output of copper in Africa and is the source of over half the world's cobalt, an ingredient in mobile phone and electric vehicle batteries.
Kabila, 46, has ruled Congo since his father was assassinated in 2001. Failure to hold the election in December could embolden militia groups whose attacks have increased since Kabila's mandate expired and have forced many people to flee their homes, deepening a severe humanitarian crisis.
The unrest has caused fears that Congo could slide into a new civil war like one that killed millions at the turn of the century.
The election commission's insistence on using the voting machines poses a dilemma for foreign donors: either they back a potentially flawed vote or withhold support, though this might be seen by Kabila as a reason to delay the vote. 
Donors are loath to choose the second option. They have gambled that concerted pressure on the authorities to respect the election date will bring about Congo's first peaceful transition of power. 
""People don't want to torpedo everything ... suggested by CENI,"" said a foreign diplomat. ""It is not in our interests to dismiss electronic voting technology and then see it used as a pretext for delays.""
However, backing a vote at all costs carries its own risks. The 2006 election caused days of fighting in Kinshasa and the 2011 vote was riddled with irregularities. 
Corneille Nangaa, the national election commission's president, did not respond to an interview request or written questions sent to his spokeswoman. He has said using the machines will more than halve the weight of election equipment and save over $100 million.
Election officials initially described them as a system of ""electronic voting"" but, because of a lack of clarity over whether they are legal in Congo, changed the wording to ""semi-electronic voting"" and then to ""a voting machine"".
WARY DONORS
Donors are wary. They have disbursed only a fraction of the $123 million the United Nations expected to set aside for elections in Congo as they await clarification on how the voting will be conducted. 
Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, warned Congolese authorities last month to use paper ballots or lose U.S. support because using an electronic voting system could undermine the credibility of the election.
Some people are worried because of what happened in Kenya, a far more developed and connected nation where voter identification technology failed in half of polling places in 2013 and concerns about the reliability of electronic vote tallies led the Supreme Court last year to order the presidential vote to be re-run. 
Namibia was the first African country to use electronic voting in a national election in 2014 but it has only 1.2 million registered voters compared to Congo's 46 million and the official rollout followed extensive testing in by-elections.
With 100,000 machines in service over 11 hours of voting as stipulated by law, each voter in Congo would have under 90 seconds to select candidates in presidential, legislative and provincial elections and print out the ballot.
Most voters will be seeing the machines for the first time. A quarter of Congolese are illiterate and are likely to require assistance. Other pitfalls abound, say diplomats following the process, including intense humidity in tropical zones. 
After listening to a presentation by Nangaa last month, Congo's influential Catholic bishops called for certification of the machines by international experts. 
It is not clear that the commission has put in place measures to maintain the machines and install necessary software. 
Election authorities have released few details about the machines' acquisition except to say they come from South Korea. Eight machines arrived in Kinshasa in January and 200 more last week, the commission said, but it has not indicated when the full complement will arrive.

Gui Minhai, a Hong Kong-based, Swedish publisher of books critical of China's leaders, was abducted in Thailand in 2015, one of five people in the Hong Kong book trade who went missing that year and later appeared in custody in mainland China.
The detentions have stirred worries among some people in Hong Kong about creeping Chinese Communist Party interference despite a guarantee of wide-ranging freedoms for the former British colony which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Gui, 53, was released from custody last October, but his whereabouts were unclear until January when his daughter said he was seized by Chinese agents onboard a Beijing-bound train while in the presence of two Swedish diplomats.
China confirmed last month that it had detained Gui.
Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said a Swedish doctor who had been sent to Gui had been denied permission to meet him on Wednesday, but Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang rejected that account.
""Although the Swedish doctor came without being invited, the Chinese side still gave the news to Gui Minhai that the Swedish doctor had come to perform a medical examination,"" Geng told a daily news briefing.
""According to what I understand, previously the Chinese side had already arranged for experts to diagnose Gui Minhai. His mental and physical health are good, and he said that at the moment he does not want to see the Swedish doctor,"" he added.
China had already informed Sweden of this, and hoped Sweden could respect this, Geng said.
""As for the Swedish side's unwarranted criticism, China absolutely cannot accept it.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's Social Democrats on Friday named two seasoned pro-European politicians to key posts in a new government, with Hamburg Mayor Olaf Scholz to become finance minister in Europe's largest economy and Heiko Maas becoming foreign minister.
The SPD's designated leader Andrea Nahles and Scholz announced the party's six ministry appointments at a news conference. Maas, who was justice minister, will replace Sigmar Gabriel as foreign minister, Nahles said.
The SPD on Sunday said two-thirds of its members had voted in favor of a repeat of the 'grand coalition' with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives that has governed Germany since 2013. The new government will be sworn in on March 14.
Nahles said Scholz, 59, a lawyer who backs closer European integration, would also be vice chancellor in the government, underpinned by a coalition deal which incorporates SPD-inspired commitments to deepening cooperation in the European Union.
Merkel's conservatives are upset that she agreed to give the SPD the finance post to secure the coalition deal after eight years under budget hawk Wolfgang Schaeuble, who was known for his insistence on austerity for indebted euro zone states.
The SPD generally favors more spending than the conservatives but the parties have agreed to stick to the goal of a balanced budget with no new debt.
But Jens Spahn, a Merkel critic who since his appointment as health minister-designate has been seen as the leader of her bloc's arch-conservative wing, warned in a newspaper interview that he would resist deeper integration.
""The creeping self-empowerment driven by institutional self-interest has to stop,"" he told the newspaper Die Welt, rejecting proposals for a finance minister for the euro zone.
On Tuesday, a senior conservative warned the SPD they would jeopardize the hard-fought coalition pact if they went overboard with spending plans for Europe.
Maas, 51, is best known for introducing laws in his previous job that forced social media companies such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter to remove hate speech from their sites.
He is an outspoken critic of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), racist crime and anti-Semitism.
Maas plans to visit key foreign capitals, including Paris - possibly as early as next week - London, Warsaw, Brussels and Washington.
Hubertus Heil will take over as labor minister. The 45-year-old has been a member of the Bundestag lower house for almost 20 years and organized two national election campaigns for the SPD as its general secretary.
The post puts him at the helm of the ministry with the biggest budget - some 135 billion euros. The SPD won labor reforms in the coalition talks such as enabling workers to switch to shortened hours for limited periods.
Katarina Barley, 49, who took over as family minister last year, will head the justice ministry. Born to a British father and German mother, she studied law and once worked at the Federal Constitutional Court.
Franziska Giffey, 39, from the former Communist East, will become family minister. Until now she has been mayor of the Berlin district of Neukoelln, home to many immigrants and high unemployment.

Svenja Schulze, a 49-year-old who worked as research and science minister in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia until the SPD lost the regional election there in 2017, was chosen as environment minister.

SALISBURY, England (Reuters) - Britain deployed specialist troops on Friday to help remove potentially contaminated objects from the small English city where a Russian double agent and his daughter were poisoned.
Sergei Skripal, 66, who once passed Russian secrets to Britain, and his daughter Yulia, 33, have been in intensive care since they were found slumped unconscious on a bench on Sunday afternoon in the cathedral city of Salisbury.
Britain's interior minister Amber Rudd, who visited Salisbury on Friday, said they were both still in a very serious condition, five days after collapsing.
About 180 troops including some with chemical expertise had been sent to the city to remove ambulances and other vehicles involved in the incident and other objects, Britain's ministry of defense and police said. 
""The public should not be alarmed,"" counter-terrorism police, who are leading the investigation, said in a statement.
""Military assistance will continue as necessary during this investigation."" 
LOW RISK
Health chiefs have said there is a low risk to the wider public from the nerve agent used against Skripal and his daughter.
Police said Skripal and his daughter were deliberately targeted with the rare toxin. They said experts had identified the substance, which will help determine the source, but they did not name it publicly.
The incident has been likened to the case of former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, a critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who died in London in 2006 after drinking green tea laced with radioactive polonium-210.
A British public inquiry said Litvinenko's killing had probably been approved by Russian President Vladimir Putin and carried out by two Russians, Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoy. Lugovoy is a former KGB bodyguard who later became a member of the Russian parliament.
Both denied responsibility and Russia has refused to extradite them. 
Britain has said it will respond robustly if evidence shows Russia was behind the Salisbury poisoning. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the incident and says anti-Russian hysteria is being whipped up by the British media. 
""In terms of further options, that will have to wait until we're absolutely clear what the consequences could be, and what the actual source of this nerve agent has been,"" Rudd said after visiting Salisbury and seeing the area around the bench where Skripal was found, now covered by a police forensics tent.
RUSSIAN RESPONSE
Responding to previous comments by the interior minister, Russia's embassy in London tweeted on Thursday: ""Totally agree with Secretary @AmberRuddHR: first evidence then conclusions on Mr Skripal's case. Responsible political approach.""
Twenty-one people were taken to hospital following the incident but apart from the Skripals only Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, the first police officer on the scene, is still being treated. He remains in a serious condition although he is now able to talk, Rudd said.
She declined to give details of the police investigation. ""We have to give the police all the space they need in order to collect all the information, to secure and to be able to be absolutely clear that there is no further risk,"" Rudd said.
Police have cordoned off Skripal's modest home in Salisbury, about 80 miles (130 km) from London, and erected forensic tents in the garden. Officers were guarding the area where he and his daughter were found, along with a pizza restaurant and a pub they had visited and the graves of Skripal's wife and son.

Skripal betrayed dozens of Russian agents to British intelligence before his arrest in Moscow in 2004. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006, and in 2010 was given refuge in Britain after being exchanged for Russian spies.

1507,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 04:35AM ET</span>",Italy's 5-Star readies proposals to other parties for government deal,"By Gavin Jones
ROME (Reuters) - The leader of Italy's anti-establishment 5-Star Movement said on Friday his party was preparing economic policy proposals for other parties as a way of finding common ground to form a government after Sunday's inconclusive election.
5-Star emerged as by far the leading party at the election but does not have enough seats to govern on its own.
Its leader Luigi Di Maio says the president should give 5-Star the right to try to form a government, but the center-right coalition parties that got most seats combined say the job should fall to them.
In an interview in daily Corriere della Sera, Di Maio said his party would soon present proposals to be incorporated in the outgoing government's multi-year economic plan, which must be presented by April 10. 
""We want to move quickly ... if the other parties want to propose other measures that will help people then we are ready to discuss them,"" Di Maio said.
The prospects for coalition building have dominated the Italian political debate since the election, with most commentators focusing on the possibility of a tie-up between 5-Star and the center-left Democratic Party (PD).
""That is what the newspapers write, but I have always said I will discuss with all the parties, with no exception,"" said Di Maio, 31, who was elected as 5-Star's leader in September.
For years after its foundation in 2009, 5-Star said it would not form coalitions with mainstream parties. 
But as the prospects of a hung parliament increased ahead of the election Di Maio nuanced that stance, saying he would be willing to discuss a common policy platform with the other parties but not negotiate over government posts.
All the main parties campaigned on pledges to cut taxes, hike spending and raise the budget deficit from levels agreed with the EU, while simultaneously promising to cut debt.
COURTING THE PD
The center-right is hoping to get the backing of the defeated PD in its own bid to form a government, one of its senior parliamentarians said in another interview in Corriere della Sera on Friday.
""We are trying to understand if the PD will be willing to give us some sort of support,"" said Renato Brunetta, lower house leader of Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party.
Brunetta reiterated that the prime minister should come from the center-right, as the largest coalition, but said it may not necessarily be Matteo Salvini, the head of the far-right League which was the leading party in the bloc at the election. 
""The candidate (now) is Salvini, but it could also be someone else that he puts forward, if that is what we agree together,"" he said.
Salvini has so far given no indication he may be willing to stand aside for another, more moderate center-right figure.
President Sergio Mattarella will not begin formal consultations with parties over government formation until after March 23, when the new parliament convenes to elect the speakers of the two houses.
On Thursday the often inscrutable Mattarella called for the parties to show ""a sense of responsibility"" and put the interests of the country before party-political considerations. 
Mattarella hopes to broker a deal which will avoid the need for a fresh election that would risk being no more conclusive than the last one, sources close to the president have said.
Di Maio told Corriere the other parties would ""pay a high price for their irresponsibility"" if they refused to negotiate with 5-Star, making new elections necessary. 5-Star won 32 percent of the vote on Sunday, almost twice as much as the second largest party. 

""We would have nothing to lose"" from a return to the polls, he said.

The Syrian government's two-week onslaught in eastern Ghouta has killed around 950 civilians, the war monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
For eastern Ghouta's civilians, mostly trapped underground with little food or water, the choice of whether or not to emerge to seek supplies may be one of life or death.
""People were hopeful after the bombardment decreased and went out onto the streets,"" said Moayad al-Hafi, a man in the Ghouta town of Saqba. ""But then air strikes began again, and there are still people under the rubble that we couldn't get out."" 
Syria and its main ally Moscow have both said the assault is needed to stop rebel shelling of nearby Damascus and end the rule of Islamist insurgents over civilians in eastern Ghouta, where some 400,000 people live.
But U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein has said, in comments criticized by Syria's government, that the assault is ""legally, and morally, unsustainable"".
There was a pause in the government's bombardment overnight, but air strikes and shelling quickly resumed after the convoy carrying food parcels crossed into eastern Ghouta, according to residents and the Observatory.
Syrian state television and a witness later said bullets and mortars were fired from inside the rebel enclave at the al-Wafideen crossing point, through which the convoy had entered.
""Shelling in proximity of Douma (in) eastern Ghouta today is putting the ... convoy at risk,"" said U.N. resident coordinator Ali al-Za'tari said.
He said the fighting had resumed ""despite assurances of safety from parties including the Russian Federation"". 
Robert Mardini, Middle East director of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said it had been ""taken aback by the fighting that broke out despite guarantees.""
FOOD PARCELS 
A Douma resident, in a voice message over which loud explosions were audible, said four jets were in the sky and residential areas had come under air attack. 
The food was supposed to be delivered on Monday when a previous convoy entered Douma, but fighting forced it to leave early without unloading fully.
The 2,400 food parcels that were delivered can sustain 12,000 people for one month, and 3,248 bags of wheat flour were also unloaded, according to the ICRC. 
For President Bashar al-Assad, the capture of Ghouta would mark a major victory as he builds on the military momentum created by Russia's 2015 entry into the war, which has restored his rule over swathes of Syria.
In around two weeks, the Syrian army has retaken nearly all the farmland in the enclave east of Damascus under cover of near-ceaseless shelling and air strikes, leaving only a dense sprawl of towns - about half the territory - still under insurgent control. 
Around a dozen imprisoned fighters from a group linked to al-Qaeda's former affiliate in Syria were allowed to leave the besieged enclave on Friday.
One of the area's two main rebel groups, Jaish al-Islam, said it had agreed with the United Nations to allow the evacuation of fighters that it was holding from Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance of jihadist factions linked to the Nusra Front. 
Jaish al-Islam and the other main rebel faction, Failaq al-Rahman, have repeatedly denied that they are in negotiations with Damascus or its ally Russia over their own evacuation.
In other areas such as Aleppo, rebels have eventually surrendered terrain in return for safe passage to other opposition areas along with relatives and civilians loath to fall back under Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's rule. 
In a statement, Jaish al-Islam said the imprisoned fighters would be sent to a rebel-held area in northwest Syria. 
Syrian state television then showed footage that it said was of 13 fighters and their families leaving the enclave.
Air strikes started up again after the evacuation, killing nine people and injuring around 28, the Observatory said. 
""ONE MEAL IN SEVERAL DAYS""
U.N. aid agencies have pleaded with the Syrian government and its ally Russia to halt the campaign and let aid in.
Bilal Abu Salah, a resident of Douma, said shortages were causing great hardship. ""Entire families eat one meal in several days,"" he said. 
The Syrian government has opened what it calls safe routes out of the enclave, but no civilians are known to have left yet.
Damascus and Moscow accuse the insurgents of shooting at civilians to prevent them fleeing. A Reuters reporter said there was small arms and mortar fire from rebel areas on the al-Wafideen crossing on Friday.
Rebels deny stopping anyone leaving and say people have refused to cross into government territory for fear of persecution. 
However, the terror of the bombardment and the desperate living conditions are taking their toll and may push people to brave the fighting and flee.
""I don't want to leave, but I don't want any harm to happen to my family,"" said Douma resident Abu Ahmad al-Ghoutani, who said he has two children. 
State media have reported people in eastern Ghouta raising Syrian government flags and holding small protests in support of Assad. The Observatory has reported protests in one village to demand an end to the bombardment and the departure of rebels. 

Tens of thousands of people have fled further into the enclave in the face of the warfare, a U.N. official said on Thursday, and residents of Douma said shelters were crowded with the new arrivals.

KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bomber blew himself up in the Afghan capital, Kabul, on Friday, killing at least seven people in an attack on a crowd gathered to commemorate a political leader from the mainly Shi'ite Hazara minority, officials said.
One policeman and six civilians were killed and 15 civilians wounded when the bomber was stopped at a security checkpoint in the Mosalla-e Mazar area in Kabul, said Najib Danesh, an interior ministry spokesman.
However, the final confirmed toll may be higher. Shah Shir Azara, a security marshal at the site, said 13 people had been killed.
The bomber appeared to have intended to attack a crowd gathered for the anniversary celebrations of the death of Abdul Ali Mazari, a Hazara political leader killed by the Taliban in 1995, but he was stopped before reaching the main gathering.
While Afghanistan, a mainly Sunni Muslim country, has not seen the level of sectarian violence common in Iraq, attacks on Shi'ite targets have become increasingly common. Over the past two years, a string of attacks on Shi'ite mosques and Hazara gatherings have been claimed by an affiliate of Islamic State.
However, little is known about the group and its capacity to conduct sophisticated attacks remains disputed, with many Afghan and Western security officials saying they doubt it works alone.
In December, dozens of people were killed in a suicide attack on a Shi'ite cultural center claimed by Islamic State and two months earlier two separate mosque attacks killed at least 72 people.
Friday's attack came less than two weeks after President Ashraf Ghani called on the Taliban to join peace talks to end more than 16 years of the latest phase of Afghan war.
However, there has been no let up in the violence that has been killing and wounding more than 10,000 civilians a year - and many more combatants - with fighting continuing across large parts of the country and Kabul itself hit repeatedly by attacks.
On Thursday night, Taliban fighters attacked a joint army and police outpost in the northern province of Takhar, killing seven soldiers and 10 policemen, according to Khalil Aseer, a provincial police spokesman.

The Taliban said in a statement that 29 soldiers and police were killed in the attack, including four commanders.

Now, as a summit unexpectedly appears possible, analysts fear U.S. President Donald Trump's understaffed administration may lack the expertise to successfully turn a political spectacle long sought by Pyongyang into a meaningful opportunity to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear program.
South Korean officials said Friday Trump almost immediately agreed to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, without preconditions, by the end of May. Even proponents of a diplomatic approach towards North Korea worry the administration could be rushing into a summit with little time to prepare.
Such a summit - the first time sitting American and North Korean leaders have ever met - would typically happen after each side had made at least some concrete agreements, said Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the New America think tank, who has engaged North Korean officials at unofficial discussions.
""It will have to be managed carefully with a great deal of prep work,"" she said on Twitter. ""Otherwise, it runs the risk of being more spectacle than substance. Right now, Kim Jong Un is setting the agenda and the pace, and the Trump administration is reacting. The administration needs to move quickly to change this dynamic.""
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has often been publicly contradicted by the White House over North Korea, including on Thursday when just hours before the announcement of a summit he said ""we are a long ways from negotiations"". 
Several experienced career diplomats occupy key positions in the Trump administration's Korea and East Asia offices, but many of them are in an acting capacity while other positions are entirely empty.
Joseph Yun, the U.S. envoy in charge of negotiating with North Korea, quit last week, and Trump has yet to nominate an ambassador to South Korea.
""A Trump meeting with Kim presents both risks and opportunities,"" said Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. 
""The U.S. side needs to be very, very well prepared and know exactly what it wants to achieve, as well as what the U.S. is willing to provide in return.""
""A REWARD TO NORTH KOREA""
Analysts say North Korea has been seeking a summit with American leaders as a way to secure international legitimacy, something that has prevented past U.S. administration's from taking Pyongyang up on its invitations. 
""A summit is a reward to North Korea,"" said Robert Kelly, a professor at South Korea’s Pusan National University. ""It extends the prestige of meeting the head of state of the world's strongest power and leading democracy. That is why we should not do it unless we get a meaningful concession from North Korea. That is why other presidents have not done it.""
If the summit fails, the cost could be higher than in the past, observers noted, with North Korea firmly in possession of a nuclear arsenal and Trump having said military strikes may be needed to remove those weapons.
Kim Jong Un has ""committed to denuclearization"" and to suspending nuclear and missile tests, South Korea's National Security Office head Chung Eui-yong told reporters at the White House on Thursday after briefing Trump. North Korea, though, has yet to provide more details. 
""There hasn't been any North Korea-U.S. summit meetings at all and having one after North Korea has already obtained nuclear weapons basically sends a signal that the U.S. is willing to deal with North Korea on that basis,"" said Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing.
""So that achieves North Korea's first objective, even if there's no progress at all in terms of what they discuss at the summit,"" Zhao said.
A senior administration official said Trump was elected to take a different approach from previous presidents.
That included avoiding low-level negotiations that have failed in the past in favor of talking directly to Kim as the ""one person who can actually make decisions instead of repeating the... long slog of the past,"" the official said.
In 2000, Marshal Jo Myong Rok, a powerful figure in the North Korean armed forces, became the first and most senior North Korean official to visit the White House and meet a U.S. president, then Bill Clinton.
Shortly after, then-U.S. secretary of state Madeleine Albright traveled to Pyongyang to meet Kim Jong Un's father and predecessor, Kim Jong Il, in a visit to lay the groundwork for a visit by Clinton that would only happen after he had left office.
During President Barack Obama's administration, North Korean officials were also seeking a breakthrough with the United States, and were disappointed when American officials offered no diplomatic concessions, former U.S. director of national intelligence, James Clapper, has said.
Even observers who credit Trump's hardline stance with setting the stage for talks said they are waiting to see if this time is different.
""North Korea has said these things before - Kim Jong Il wanted to meet with President Clinton,"" said Mark Dubowitz, CEO of Washington’s Foundation for Defense of Democracies think-tank. 

""Pyongyang has to be serious about denuclearization. In the meantime, the Trump administration should continue using the toughest sanctions to maintain maximum pressure before the summit in May.""

The teachers, who were targeted in an operation across the capital Ankara and 19 other provinces, had worked in schools previously closed for alleged links to the network of the U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, Anadolu said.
In another operation launched in central Turkey's Konya and spread across 42 other provinces, authorities issued warrants for 84 people suspected of similar ties.
Police detained eight members of Gulen's network and were looking for two more in a third operation focused on southern Turkey's Mersin and four other provinces, the agency said.
Ankara says Gulen and his network were behind the failed coup attempt of July 2016 during which 250 people were killed. Gulen has denied involvement.
More than 50,000 people have been jailed and over 150,000 sacked or suspended from the military, schools and the public institutions in a crackdown following the coup attempt.
Critics say Erdogan is using the failed coup as a pretext to quash dissent. Turkey says the strict measures are required given the security threats it faces.

1512,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 02:31AM ET</span>",Indefinite rule for China's Xi snuffs out activists' reform hopes,"By Christian Shepherd and Natalie Thomas
BEIJING (Reuters) - During Chinese President Xi Jinping's first years in office, rights activists tried to remain buoyant despite shrinking opportunities to organize. 
They staged small-scale protests, switched messaging platforms to avoid surveillance, supported the families and friends of those jailed, and pledged to continue their rights work come what may.
But a move to end presidential term limits, enabling Xi to remain in office indefinitely, may well have slammed the door shut on any hopes for a resurgence of grassroots activism and pressure for democratic political reform.
On Sunday, delegates at the annual meeting of China's largely rubber-stamp parliament are expected to ratify the necessary constitutional amendment to make Xi the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, the founder of communist China.
""To say it's a low period sounds too superficial. It will be more like a freeze, where not one inch of grass is born. A barren period, for a very long time,"" said Zhao Sile, a mainland journalist and activist who is a visiting scholar at National Chung Cheng University in Taiwan, where she recently published a book on social movements in China over the past two decades.
A growing space for activism in the early 2000s, fueled by social media and a movement of liberal reformers in the run-up to Beijing's hosting of the 2008 Olympics, was buffeted by intermittent crackdowns from late that year to 2013, when Xi assumed power. 
But the Xi era has been marked by what many activists say has been an unremitting squeeze on public dissent, including the government's increasing control and censorship of cyberspace.
China's State Council Information Office, which also speaks for the ruling Communist Party, did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment for this article. 
Delegates gathered at the parliamentary meeting in Beijing say scrapping the two-term presidential limit is popular with ordinary Chinese who are happy to have a leader of Xi's caliber.
'MORE POWERFUL THAN MAO'
Rights lawyers, once among the most active and vocal groups of reformers in China, have faced what activist groups call a coordinated campaign of repression under Xi.
As an example, a day after the announcement of term limits being scrapped, central China’s Lengshuijiang city justice bureau warned lawyers and law-firms that a failure to “maintain consistency” with the Communist Party when speaking about the amendments to the constitution online could mean being disbarred, according to a letter circulated online. Reuters was unable to independently verify the document’s authenticity.
A number of rights lawyers have been disbarred by the authorities in recent months for allegedly breaching rules governing their behavior .
Such crackdowns mean that fewer people are prepared to go public with any criticism of Xi.
""Any opposition he faces from his opponents will be far, far smaller than what Mao Zedong faced,"" said writer and activist Mo Zhixu, who is married to Zhao and is also a visiting scholar at Chung Cheng. 
Mo writes on Chinese politics as a member of the non-profit Independent Chinese PEN Center, which since its founding in 2001 has been an intellectual home for critics of China's political system, including Nobel Peace Prize-winner Liu Xiaobo.
Liu, who was president of the centre from 2003 to 2007, died of cancer last year while in Chinese custody.
In 2008, Liu and others wrote a manifesto known as Charter 08, calling for China's constitution to be rewritten to ensure liberal democracy and to abolish one-party rule.
One activist inside China who is still prepared to go public is Li Datong, a former editor at the state-run China Youth Daily who was fired in 2006 after publishing article that pushed for greater civil liberties. He said news of term limits being abolished sparked outrage and anger in liberal chat groups online. 
“It’s not a policy change. It’s a change of China’s political system – of the foundation of that system. To not speak out would be to give tacit consent,” he said. 
“But under current government pressure, resistance is like a loose pan of sand. There can be no organized action, and each individual’s ability to protest is limited.”
AFTER TIANANMEN
Many current activists were spawned and inspired by Liu and others closely involved in the protests in Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) in the center of Beijing in 1989 that called for democracy, a free press and freedom of speech. 
In a bloody crackdown that led to an unknown number of deaths - some foreign estimates put the numbers in the thousands - the Chinese authorities sent tanks and troops into the square on June 4, 1989.
But even after Tiananmen there was hope for the activists. China's then paramount leader Deng Xiaoping initiated economic reforms that set the stage for China's decades of rapid growth that prompted many campaigners to predict that growing prosperity would spur political reform.
Those expectations have been thwarted under Xi.
Hu Jia, a prominent activist who was imprisoned in 2008 for three-and-a-half years for subversion, said Xi has been far more ""ruthless"" in his suppression of activists than the previous two administrations, but that activists should continue to take a stand - despite the consequences.
Hu says he remains under surveillance and currently has been taken on an enforced ""holiday"" in southern China by police minders - a regular occurrence for some dissidents made to leave the capital during big political meetings.

""I think that if everyone in China was a coward, if everyone was spineless then we'd still be living in the Qin dynasty,"" he said, referring to the first dynasty of Imperial China.

1513,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 07:05AM ET</span>",Japan tax agency head quits amid cronyism scandal,"By Linda Sieg and Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's National Tax Agency chief, under fire for remarks about a suspected cronyism scandal, quit on Friday, but his resignation was unlikely to end the furor over the affair that threatens to erode Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's popularity.
Finance Minister Taro Aso told a news conference that Sagawa, a former ministry official appointed to the tax post last July, had offered his resignation for causing confusion in parliament, where debate has been snarled over the affair.
Sagawa has been accused of trying, last year, to dispel suspicion that a school operator with ties to Abe's wife, Akie, got a sweetheart deal on land for a school in the city of Osaka which helped slice the premier's popularity.
Aso, a close Abe ally, said Sagawa would take a temporary pay cut and might face more punishment.
But the unrepentant finance minister added that Sagawa had done a good job and his appointment was appropriate.
Aso, 77, also said he himself had no intention to quit over the affair. ""Sagawa's resignation is regrettable. But I have no plan now to resign,"" Aso said.
Abe has denied that he or his wife did favors for the former head of school operator Moritomo Gakuen, Yasunori Kagoike. Kagoike and his wife were arrested in July on suspicion of illegally receiving subsidies.
Abe, in his sixth year in office and eyeing a three-year extension from September, had seemed to put the matter behind him with a big election win for the ruling bloc in October.
But opposition parties have turned up the heat again after the Asahi newspaper said some documents about the land sale might have been doctored.
That followed revelations that the finance ministry had retained documents that officials had said no longer existed.
Last year, Sagawa, then the head of the ministry's financial bureau, told parliament the materials had been discarded.
A senior lawmaker from the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan told reporters that Sagawa's resignation would not bring the affair to a close.
""If those in power intend to use Mr. Sagawa's resignation to draw a curtain (on the scandal), we cannot accept that. I believe this is a matter over which politicians should take political responsibility,"" Kiyomi Tsujimoto told reporters.
POSSIBLE SUICIDE
Aso, who doubles as deputy premier, could end up in the hot seat if it turns out that officials of his ministry altered approved documents.
Media said on Friday police were investigating as a possible suicide the death of an official at a finance ministry bureau that handled the land deal at the center of the scandal.
The official in the region where the school is located was found dead at his home on Wednesday and police are investigating the matter as a suicide, Kyodo and Jiji news agencies said. 
A police spokesman declined to comment.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a regular news conference that he had been notified about the death of the official but declined to give any details. He said he did not know whether the official had been questioned by prosecutors.
Protesters demanding the resignations of Sagawa and Aso have gathered in front of the ministry in recent weeks. 
The ministry on Thursday released to parliament hundreds of pages of what it said were copies of the original documents, but opposition lawmakers said their doubts remained.
Abe's ruling bloc has big majorities in both houses of parliament, so his grip on power appears unlikely to be at risk.
But falling support could complicate his bid for a third term as Liberal Democratic Party leader in a September party vote. Re-election would put him on track to become Japan's longest-serving premier.

1514,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 02:00AM ET</span>",Attack on Chinese billionaire exposes growing racial divide in Malaysia,"By Praveen Menon
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A volley of insults hurled by ruling party officials in Malaysia at 94-year-old ethnic-Chinese tycoon, Robert Kuok, has exposed a racial and religious divide ahead of elections due by August.
Leaders from UMNO targeted Hong Kong-based Malaysian billionaire Robert Kuok in the last two weeks, accusing him of funding a majority-Chinese opposition party to overthrow Najib's government.
The attacks stopped after Kuok, Malaysia’s richest man, threatened legal action against a website he said had cast aspersions on his commitment to democracy. Prime Minister Najib Razak also stepped in to calm the waters.
Many in Malaysia's economically powerful ethnic Chinese community saw the criticism against Kuok as racial dog-whistling ahead of a very close and hotly contested election.
A polarized electorate poses risks for Southeast Asia's third-largest economy.
Malaysia's ethnic minorities may end up with the short end of the stick if this year's electoral results remains racially split, warned Abdul Rahman Dahlan, strategic communications director for Najib's coalition.
""Of course we’ll be happy we win the election. But it will be better if the support comes from a broad base of support from the communities of all kinds, then everybody’s voice will be represented,"" said Abdul Rahman, who is also an UMNO member of parliament told Reuters.
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
Najib's United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) has increasingly relied on majority Malay Muslims to stay in power, after minorities deserted the ruling coalition the past two general elections. An election won entirely with the support of ethnic Malays could stall reform of a decades-old race-based affirmative action policy favoring indigenous groups, officials and analysts warn. 
The policy, which grew out of 1969 race riots, reserves a large share of government contracts for Malay businesses. It remains in effect, even after it was due to expire in 1990.
Najib proposed a new economic model soon after taking power in 2009, aimed at speeding Malaysia's transition to a higher-income, knowledge-based economy, but rolled back some of those plans after a backlash from the Malay-Muslim community.
Ethnic Malays and other indigenous groups account for about 69 percent of the population, with Chinese making up 23 percent, and ethnic Indians and other the remainder. Opinion surveys have found indigenous groups robustly support affirmative action policies. 
UMNO has also been courting hardliners on the religious right, seeking support from the Islamist opposition Parti Islam se-Malaysia (PAS), which advocates a strict Islamic penal code that religious minorities fear could infringe their rights.
Divisions among ethnic and religious groups are intensifying in Malaysia, said the Eurasia Group, whose list of top risks for 2018 includes the growth of identity politics in Southeast Asia.
""There is a trend towards a more conservative interpretation of Islam and the key Islamic party PAS will play a significant role during the upcoming election,"" Eurasia Group said in a recent research note about Malaysia.
SUGAR KING
Dubbed the “Sugar King of Asia”, Kuok became Malaysia’s richest man by expanding a commodities-based business to an international empire that includes the Shangri-la hotel chain, plantations, property development and entertainment.
He has iconic status in the Malaysian Chinese community.
""Kuok is a successful man, and a true Malaysian,"" said 52-year-old Eric Hun at a tea shop in Kuala Lumpur's Chinatown. ""This kind of comment will win them (UMNO) the Malay votes in the kampung (village). That's all they want ... they stopped caring about us a long time ago.""
Ethnic Chinese voted heavily for the opposition camp in the last election in 2013, handing the UMNO-led coalition its first-ever loss of the popular vote. Najib called it a ""Chinese tsunami"".
Two years later, thousands of UMNO supporters marched through Chinatown to support Najib, and assert Malay political power threatening to burn down shops in a racially tinged rally that prompted blunt criticism from China's ambassador to Malaysia.
With national polls just months away, the attacks on Kuok has strained relations with the Chinese party in Najib's ruling coalition, the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA).
The MCA has demanded an apology from Malay leaders who criticized Kuok. 
""Right now we're on extreme ends, with the government on the extreme right and the opposition on the extreme left,"" said Kong Len Wei, youth leader at MCA, whose parliamentary seats halved to just seven in the last election.
Najib tried to calm tensions by saying later in the week that Kuok's success as an entrepreneur is an inspiration for other entrepreneurs to succeed. The government ordered the news blog that published reports on Kuok to pull down the stories.
Opposition parties, led by Chinese-based Democratic Action Party (DAP), have also ramped up the racial rhetoric.
""The Robert Kuok incident is not an isolated incident,"" said DAP's National Political Education Director Liew Chin Tong. 
""It is just another example of the past decade or so in which UMNO survives on manufacturing fear among Malays towards others, in the hope to consolidate Malay support for UMNO.""
Najib is still widely expected to win the elections on the back of a rebound in the economy and the support of rural Malay voters. Parliament is also expected to approve a periodic redrawing of electoral boundaries, which critics say would also favor the ruling coalition.
BRAIN DRAIN
Disillusioned ethnic Chinese have been voting with their feet over the past two decades, migrating to neighboring Singapore and Western countries in a troubling brain drain of talent and capital.
A total of 56,576 Malaysians gave up their citizenship between 2006 and 2016 with over 90 percent of them being ethnic-Chinese, Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister said in parliament in 2016, The Star newspaper reported.
Thirty-one year old Oh, who stayed back in Melbourne after her graduation there said she won't return to Malaysia unless meritocracy is restored.

""It is the race-based policies that are causing a brain drain and holding back the advancement of the nation,"" said Oh, who is a senior designer at a Melbourne-based architectural studio.

1515,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",Trump-Kim summit fans Japan fears of being sidelined on North Korea,"By Linda Sieg and Nobuhiro Kubo
TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's agreement to meet North Korea's leader looked likely to fan Japanese angst over being sidelined, although Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday there was no diplomatic daylight between Tokyo and Washington.
Trump has agreed to meet Kim Jong Un by May in response to an invitation from the North Korean leader, a potentially dramatic breakthrough in the nuclear standoff with Pyongyang.
Abe told reporters after a phone call with Trump that Japan and the United States would continue to be ""together 100 percent"" and that he'd meet Trump in Washington in April.
Despite Japan's security alliance with the United States, concerns have simmered that Trump may cut a deal to protect its cities from nuclear attack while leaving Japan vulnerable.
Two missile tests last year flew over Japan, and Japan is often targeted by North Korea's bellicose rhetoric and threats.
Trump said on Twitter that ""Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze."" 
Worries persist, however, that the outcome of the talks will fall short of Japan's insistence the North totally abandon its nuclear and missile development. Tokyo had wanted a commitment on that by Pyongyang to be a precondition for talks.
Takahashi Kawakami, a professor at Tokyo's Takushoku University, said three possible scenarios lay ahead: that Pyongyang agrees to denuclearize, that it agrees on a nuclear freeze, or that it goes back to missile launches.
""Of those I see the second as the most likely, with Japan's calls for continued pressure sidelined,"" Kawakami said.
A freeze would worry Japan as it would ""lock in North Korea's limited nuclear capacity and its existing capacity to hit Japan and South Korean targets while the U.S. is out of range,"" said Brad Glosserman, a visiting professor at Tama University. ""It would legitimize Kim Jung Un in ways that Japan doesn't want to see.""
TIME IN PYONGYANG'S FAVOR
A Japanese ruling party lawmaker said Washington was unlikely to agree to a freeze but that North Korea could gain time to complete its nuclear arms program and thus bolster its bargaining power. 
""Time is in North Korea's favor,"" said the lawmaker, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the topic.
If the North achieves its goal of developing a missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the United States, Japan would have to bolster its deterrence, including by asking Washington to deploy nuclear submarines in its vicinity, the lawmaker said.
Not everyone was pessimistic about Japan being left out.
“The big thing is what is the goal, and that'll be discussed by South Korea, Japan and the United States,” said Katsuhiko Nakamura, executive director at think tank Asian Forum Japan.
Abe has forged close personal ties with Trump, a former real estate billionaire who is proud of his prowess as a deal-maker. No other incumbent U.S. president has met a North Korean leader.
Trump's diplomatic inexperience and a dearth of veterans on his team who have dealt with Pyongyang is also troubling.

""There are not people in the White House who are experienced in negotiations with North Korea, so I have a little bit of apprehension about the process,"" said a former Japanese diplomat. ""One meeting is OK but if a second meeting takes place without results, that will be a big mistake.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Individuals have a right to die with dignity, India's Supreme Court said on Friday in a landmark verdict that permits the removal of life-support systems for the terminally ill or those in incurable comas.
Passive euthanasia, as it is called, will apply only to a terminally ill person with no hope of recovery, a panel of five judges said. Active euthanasia, by administering a lethal injection, continues to be illegal in India.
When the sanctity of life was destroyed, said a panel of five judges headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra, ""Should we not allow them to cross the door and meet death with dignity? For some, even their death could be a moment of celebration.""
The court also permitted individuals to decide against artificial life support, should the need arise, by creating a ""living will"".
The decision makes it legal for the terminally ill to decide against using life support systems to continue living, and frees the doctors and families of those who slip into incurable comas to halt such measures, in the patients' best interest.
A national debate over the legalization of euthanasia was sparked off by the death in 2015 of a 66-year-old nurse, Aruna Shanbaug, who had survived in a coma for more than 40 years after she was sexually assaulted. 
""This is an important, historic decision, which clears the air,"" said supreme court lawyer Prashant Bhushan.
""Everybody will breathe a sigh of relief, because people were earlier apprehensive that if they withdrew life support, they could be prosecuted for culpable homicide,"" he added.
Bhushan had filed a petition to the Supreme Court on behalf of a non-government body, Common Cause, seeking recognition of the right to establish a living will.
""The court has held that an individual has a full right to decide that he should not take any kind of medical treatment or that he should not be kept alive by artificial life support systems,"" he added.

Suspicions that a school operator with ties to Abe's wife, Akie, got a sweetheart deal on land for a school in the city of Osaka dented the premier's popularity last year and the opposition has increased pressure on Abe after documents released by a ministry failed to banish suspicion that some had been doctored.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's Kim Jong Un joked about his image in international media while serving South Korean officials local spirits and cold noodles during their unprecedented visit to Pyongyang this week, two South Korean government sources said.
During the meeting, Kim committed to giving up his nuclear weapons and told the South Korea officials he would like to meet U.S. President Donald Trump, delegation leader Chung Eui-yong told reporters at the White House on Thursday - a potentially dramatic breakthrough in nuclear tensions with Pyongyang.
During their meetings, Kim made light-hearted remarks about how he is viewed outside North Korea in international media and elsewhere, one Blue House official said. The officials who spoke asked to remain unnamed due to the sensitivity of the issue.
Kim, repeatedly derided as ""Little Rocket Man"" by Trump, was ""very aware"" of his image, the official said, and reacted to comments made about him in a ""relaxed"" manner by joking about himself from time to time.
South Korean officials say Trump and Kim now plan to meet by the end of May, in what would be the first ever meeting between a sitting U.S. President and a North Korean leader. 
Tensions rose to their highest in years in 2017 following a battery of missile tests by North Korea, before a detente championed by South Korean President Moon Jae-In during his country's hosting of the Winter Olympics began to bear fruit.
The Trump administration has warned all options are on the table, including military ones, in dealing with Pyongyang, which has pursued its weapons programs in defiance of ever tougher U.N. sanctions.
When the South Korean officials visited, no hard feelings were displayed and Kim Jong Un was the first to tackle sensitive topics, including the resumption of a military exercise between South Korea and the United States that was postponed for a peaceful Winter Olympics, the Blue House official said. 
""This is when we knew the efforts of North and South Korea taken after the Moon Jae-in administration began had paid off,"" said one participant of the North Korea visit.
Kim's administration had also taken note of what North Korean foods the South Korean officials had mentioned while his sister Kim Yo Jong was visiting Seoul for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics. 
The delegation was served North Korean hotpot the first day and cold noodles - another regional specialty - the next, the Blue House official said.
Kim and the officials shared several bottles of wine, liquor made of ginseng and Pyongyang soju, the official said.
""The bottles kept coming,"" said another administrative source who had official knowledge of the meeting. 
The South Korean visitors to Pyongyang did not see one-on-one trackers that usually follow visitors in the North and were free to move about on the premises of the hotel, the first official added. 
At the dinner on the first night, South Korean officials were able to observe the relationship between Kim and his wife, Ri Sol Ju, said the second administrative source.
The source said Kim did not come across as overbearing, describing the spouses as appearing ""equal"". 

""They seemed to be quite close to one another and he didn't seem like one of your conservative husbands.""

1519,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 11:03PM ET</span>","Seven years after tsunami, Japanese live uneasily with seawalls","By Megumi Lim
RIKUZENTAKATA, Japan (Reuters) - When a massive earthquake struck in 2011, Japanese oyster fisherman Atsushi Fujita was working as usual by the sea. Soon after, a huge black wave slammed into his city and killed nearly 2,000 people.
Seven years on, Fujita and thousands like him along Japan's northeast coast have rebuilt their lives alongside huge sea walls that experts say will protect them if another giant tsunami, which some see as inevitable in a seismically active nation like Japan, was to strike.
The 12.5-metre (41-ft) concrete wall replaced a 4-metre breakwater that was swamped in the March 11, 2011 disaster. The earthquake and tsunami, which reached as high as 30 meters in some areas, killed nearly 18,000 people across Japan and triggered a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima power plant.
""It feels like we're in jail, even though we haven't done anything bad,"" the 52-year-old Fujita said. 
(Click http://reut.rs/2oT9XTa to see a picture package of the sea walls built after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.)
Since the disaster, some towns have forbidden construction in flat areas nearest the coast and have relocated residents to higher land. Others, such as Rikuzentakata, have raised the level of their land by several meters before constructing new buildings.
A common thread, though, is the construction of seawalls to replace breakwaters that were overwhelmed by the tsunami. Some 395 km (245 miles) of walls have been built at a cost of 1.35 trillion yen ($12.74 billion).
""The seawalls will halt tsunamis and prevent them from inundating the land,"" said Hiroyasu Kawai, researcher at the Port and Airport Research Institute in Yokosuka, near Tokyo.
""Even if the tsunami is bigger than the wall, the wall will delay flooding and guarantee more time for evacuation.""
ADJUSTING
Many residents initially welcomed the idea of the walls but have become more critical over time. Some say they were not consulted enough in the planning stages or that money spent on the walls has meant that other rebuilding, such as housing, has fallen behind.
Others worry the walls will damage tourism.
""About 50 years ago, we came up here with the kids and enjoyed drives along the beautiful ocean and bays,"" said Reiko Iijima, a tourist from central Japan, who was eating at an oyster restaurant across from the seawall.
""Now, there's not even a trace of that.""
Part of a wall in the city of Kesennuma, further south, has windows in it - but these, too, draw complaints.
""They're a parody,"" said Yuichiro Ito, who lost his home and younger brother in the tsunami. ""It's just to keep us happy with something we never wanted in the first place.""
Fisherman Fujita said that while the tsunami had improved oyster farming in the area by stirring up sea floors and removing accumulated sludge, the sea walls could block natural water flows from the land and impact future production.
Many municipalities said the giant walls had to be in place before permission could be granted for reconstruction elsewhere.
""I can't say things like 'the wall should be lower' or 'we don't need it,'"" said Katsuhiro Hatakeyama, who has rebuilt his bed and breakfast business in the same location as before. ""It's thanks to the wall that I could rebuild, and now have a job.""
But many find the wall hard to adjust to.

""Everyone here has lived with the sea, through generations,"" said Sotaro Usui, head of a tuna supply company. ""The wall keeps us apart - and that's unbearable.""

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (Reuters) - ""If he shoots, play dead,"" the mother of a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student told her daughter during the Florida mass shooting last month that left 17 dead, according to a recording of an emergency 911 call released on Thursday.
The mother, who can be overheard talking to her daughter while a man speaks with the 911 dispatcher, repeatedly tells her daughter she loves her until the police arrive at the school in Parkland on Feb. 14, according to the recording released by the Broward Sheriff's Office.
“I love you, I love you, it’s going to be fine. Can you hide somewhere? Can you play dead?” the unidentified mother can be heard saying on the call, which lasted more than 15 minutes. “If he shoots, you need to play dead. If he shoots, play dead.”
The call was one of 10 released on Thursday of 81 received the day of the shooting.
Nikolas Cruz, a 19-year-old former student, is accused of using a semiautomatic assault rifle to kill 17 students and faculty members at the high school. 
A Florida grand jury formally indicted Cruz on Wednesday on 17 counts of premeditated murder in the first degree and 17 counts of attempted murder in the first degree for the shooting spree. He faces either execution or life in prison without parole if convicted.
On the recorded 911 call in which the unidentified mother can be overheard, the dispatcher advises the man who called what to tell the girl.
""Don't do nothing. I don't need her to make any noise. Everybody needs to be quiet in that room,"" the dispatcher said.
Only one recording that was released came from inside the school, and it was made by someone who sounded like a male student whispering during the 40-second call.
“Someone is shooting up the school at Stoneman Douglas,” the voice said.
“I’m sorry,” the 911 operator said. “I can’t hear you. What’s happening?”
“Someone is shooting up Marjory Stoneman Douglas,” he said.
“Someone is doing what? Hello? Hello? Hello,” said the operator as heavy breathing could be heard.
“Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School is being shot up,” the caller said before the call ended in a dial tone.
  In other calls, dispatchers advised adults to tell students they were in contact with to silence their cellphones and hide.
Also on Thursday, Cruz's lawyers changed his plea to ""stands mute"" to the charges from his initial plea of ""not guilty,"" according to court documents.
The public defender's office in Broward County has said Cruz was willing to plead guilty if county prosecutors choose not to pursue the death penalty. The prosecutors' office has not announced whether it will pursue Cruz's execution.
""We are not saying he is not guilty, but we can’t plead guilty while death is still on the table,"" his attorney, public defender Howard Finkelstein, told Reuters in an email.
However, Finkelstein said that a not guilty plea ""seemed wrong"" and was ""a legal fiction that could bring unnecessary pain to the victims' families.""

Finkelstein said Cruz would agree to 34 consecutive life sentences without parole, for the 17 people killed and 17 wounded. He said the court would likely enter a plea of ""not guilty"" on Cruz's behalf to move the case forward.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican government said its plan to sell a prime piece of land in the capital that could fetch up to $1 billion will not take place in the short term, meaning it will likely be left to the next administration and could face resistance if a left-wing frontrunner wins office in July.
Reuters reported last week that the government was moving forward with plans to sell a 310 acre (125 hectare) military site that is one of the last big swaths of developable land in central Mexico City.
But after Mexican media reported residents were concerned with the possible transformation of a largely verdant site into urban development and the sale became an election campaign issue, Mexico's administration and property transfer service said on Wednesday that it would not call for bids in the ""short or medium term.""
That likely rules out the possibility of a sale before President Enrique Pena Nieto leaves office on Nov. 30, and whether the sale goes ahead at all may depend on who wins the July 1 presidential election.
When asked about the project, presidential frontrunner and former Mexico City mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told newspaper Reforma in comments published on Wednesday that he was against privatization and ""risking national assets."" 
One city lawmaker said in a statement that the site should be turned into a public park. 
Ricardo Anaya, in second place in opinion polls, did not rule out a sale but told reporters at a real estate conference that any such transaction would require ""absolute transparency"" and public approval.
Ruling party candidate Jose Antonio Meade, the former head of the finance ministry that would oversee the sale, told local media that officials appear committed to an open process.
""I've heard the federal government say that there won't be any bidding process that isn't well-timed, transparent,"" he said.
The possible sale of the site, which sits between posh office and residential neighborhoods, was quietly announced in the government's official gazette last month but went largely unnoticed in the media.
According to the gazette, the site is no longer needed by the military and offers no use for other public institutions. Funds from its sale would go to the federal treasury.

Real estate experts say the land could fetch up to $1 billion at auction. That could make the transaction the priciest land sale ever in Mexico, and one of the largest in Latin America.

The legislation, proposed by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski last month, will replace anti-graft rules that restrict the financial movements of companies that have acknowledged or been convicted of corruption.
Critics have blamed the current rules, passed a year ago, for slowing economic growth and discouraging companies from telling prosecutors about bribes they may have taken part in or known about.
The finance ministry said last month that the new rules will allow companies that broker a plea deal with the attorney general's office to receive an entire or partial exemption from the restrictions.
Earlier this week, the Banking Association of Peru warned the economy could face its worst crisis in decades unless the new rules were passed urgently.
The current rules were passed to ensure that Brazilian builder Odebrecht [ODBES.UL], which has admitted paying $29 million in bribes to secure contracts, pays eventual fines for corruption.
Kuczynski's center-right government has not yet proposed a figure for the fine Odebrecht must pay or approved the sale of its local businesses and projects.
Some 30 construction companies, including Peru's largest, Grana y Montero, are now under investigation by public prosecutors.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp is seeking to regain lost turf in crucial legislative by-elections on Sunday that it hopes will draw protest votes against perceived political screening and creeping control from Communist Party rulers in Beijing. 
The opposition in the former British colony has lost the power to block most bills in the Legislative Council since six lawmakers, elected by more than 180,000 votes in 2016, were ousted, and activists fear the council will become a rubber-stamp parliament, like the National People's Congress in Beijing, if the seats are not recaptured.
Four of the ejected lawmakers were pro-democracy, two pro-independence, a red line for Beijing.
Fifteen candidates are running for four of those seats with the results difficult to predict - the streets are mostly quiet, there are few election banners, even fewer televised debates and no comprehensive popularity polls. 
""The mood is subdued... Many people feel helpless and think things can't be changed and the central government will eventually take control over Hong Kong,"" said 20-year-old student Peter Lee who attended a pro-democracy rally of a few hundred people.
""But that's why we need to come out now to demand changes, before it's too late.""
His preferred candidate, student activist Agnes Chow, 21, has already been disqualified because she supports Hong Kong's right to self-determination, which China sees as a front for outright independence.
Chow and her party, Demosisto, say they are not advocating independence but instead demanding a referendum on Hong Kong's future, which would include independence, among other options. 
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula which guarantees it a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including limited democracy. 
But massive street protests in 2014 failed to ensure universal suffrage, with Beijing vetting candidates for the territory's leader chosen by a small electoral group stacked with pro-Beijing elite.
'STRATEGY TO DIMINISH AUTONOMY'
While city-wide elections that fill up half the 70-seat legislature once every four years are seen as the most open, international confidence in Hong Kong's electoral freedom was shaken after candidates and elected lawmakers were ousted.
The European Union in January criticized a government decision to bar Chow from running, while former British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, who represented London in meetings with Beijing in the two years leading up to the 1997 handover, called the disqualifications ""unacceptable"".
""They reinforce the concern, that has already been expressed, that there may be a strategy to diminish Hong Kong's autonomy in a step by step process over the years,"" he wrote in a foreword to a report published by British non-government organization Hong Kong Watch on Thursday.
Among the 15 candidates is ousted lawmaker Edward Yiu, a 53-year-old surveyor and former professor who emerged as an unlikely politician after the 2014 protests.
After working as a legislator for nearly a year, last July a Hong Kong court, citing a Beijing interpretation, ruled Yiu's oath of office invalid because he had added a few phrases, including a vow to fight for universal suffrage.
""This election is a vote of no confidence against the disqualifications and against authoritarianism,"" Yiu said.
Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp emerged victorious in the 2016 city-wide poll that saw a record turnout sending a crop of new young activists and protest leaders into the legislature. 
But the city's then chief executive won lawsuits against the six over the validity of their oaths, some laden with profanities and demands for independence, stripping them of their seats. 
Two more by-elections are expected to be held after an appeal filed by two of the six legislators is over.
At the height of the oath-taking saga, Beijing's parliament issued a pre-emptive legal interpretation over how Hong Kong oaths should be taken while the case was heard in court, sparking the ire of 2,000 lawyers protesting against its perceived interference over the city's vaunted rule of law.

But the pro-establishment camp said it was the lawmakers' own fault for not taking their oaths solemnly and challenging Beijing's red line.

The airport has now resumed processing passengers as per usual, it said on Twitter, without specifying details of the problem. ""We are working hard to catch up any delays,"" it said.
The glitch affected outbound flights from its international terminal and one of its two domestic terminals. Inbound flights were not affected.
Qantas Airways Ltd, the country's biggest carrier, said it was not affected as it operates out of a different terminal.

ACAPULCO, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexico, burdened by warring drug cartels that launder untold billions of dollars every year, needs to improve the rule of law in order to better combat financial crimes, Finance Minister Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya said in an interview on Thursday.
""We have to improve the rule of law so that these things can be prosecuted more efficiently,"" Gonzalez Anaya told Reuters on the sidelines of the Mexican banking association's annual convention in the seaside resort of Acapulco.
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international organization based in Paris that sets global standards for fighting illicit finance, criticized Mexico in a January report.
The report said money laundering was not being investigated and prosecuted in a proactive and systematic fashion, and said the number of prosecutions and convictions is very low.
Gonzalez Anaya said Mexico has the political will to tackle the issue, pointing to the arrest of powerful drug kingpins like Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.
""The fact that we have been making progress and we have captured many of the biggest criminals shows you that the conviction to fight crime is there,"" said Gonzalez Anaya, a Harvard-educated former World Bank official.
Guzman is sitting in a U.S. jail awaiting a Sept. 5 trial date on drug trafficking and conspiracy charges, after Mexican authorities recaptured him and extradited him. 
Still, according to the government's own estimates, Mexico has made little progress on seizing illicit cash.
It seized just $32.5 million in 2016, or less than 0.1 percent of the $58.5 billion of illicit revenues the government estimates is generated by organized crime annually.
""We need to keep working, this is an ongoing process that we need to work on because it is evolving and it is evolving in size and in nature,"" Gonzalez Anaya said. ""We have been adopting new standards of money laundering in Mexico.""
Mexico is the top supplier of illegal drugs to the United States and both countries' authorities have been criticized by civil society groups for leaving drug gang finances largely intact.
""Mexican financial authorities and U.S. financial authorities, we have a good and fluent relationship in all of these issues,"" said Gonzalez Anaya.

Graft scandals have for decades dogged the political elite in Mexico, which ranked 128th out of 137 nations for ethics and corruption in the World Economic Forum's 2017-2018 Global Competitiveness Index.

Federal Judge Eva Parcio de Seleme approved the order to capture the Jing Yuan 626, which the coast guard detected on Feb. 21 allegedly fishing illegally in Argentina's exclusive economic zone off the Patagonian coast. 
Illegal fishing by Chinese boats has tested diplomatic relations between President Mauricio Macri and China. In 2016, the coast guard sank a Chinese trawler it said was fishing illegally in its territorial waters.
After detecting the Jing Yuan last month, the coast guard said it called on the boat to stop moving, at which point it turned off its lights and tried to escape into international waters. 
An Argentine coast guard vessel pursued the boat and fired warning shots, but it said four other boats tried to collide with its vessel to prevent the Jing Yuan from being captured. The Foreign Ministry called off the operation after eight hours.
Argentina's coast is rich in squid, hake and prawns.
China has the world's largest and farthest-ranging fishing operation, with 2,500 vessels logging approximately 17 million hours of fishing in 2016, mostly off the southern coast of their home country but also in Africa and South America.
Last year, Chinese trawlers were seized off Senegal, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau over illegal fishing.

1527,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 05:40PM ET</span>",Iraq's Shi'ite militias formally inducted into security forces,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi issued a decree on Thursday formalizing the inclusion of Shi'ite paramilitary groups in the country's security forces.
According to the decree, members of the Shi'ite militias, an assortment of militia groups known collectively as the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), which are mostly backed and trained by Iran, will be granted many of the same rights as members the military. 
Paramilitary members will be given equivalent salaries to those members of the military under the Ministry of Defense's control, the decree said. They will also be subject to the laws of military service and will gain access to military institutes and colleges. 
The decree had been expected for some time and comes two months ahead of a high-stakes general election. The PMF commands popular support among Iraq's majority Shi'ite population and is expected to sway voters.
Tens of thousands of Iraqis heeded a call to arms in 2014 after Islamic State seized a third of the country’s territory, forming the PMF. The paramilitaries supported Iraq's military in ejecting Islamic State from areas the militants overran in 2014, when Iraqi military and police divisions deserted en masse. 
Iraq declared victory over the militants in December, but the militias, estimated to comprise more than 60,000 fighters, are still deployed in many of the predominantly Sunni areas which saw heavy fighting during the three-year war to oust Islamic State. 
Iraq's parliament passed a law in 2016 to bring the PMF into the state apparatus, with the militias reporting directly to the prime minister, who is a Shi'ite under Iraq's governing system. 
Iran has a clear hand in coordinating the PMF leadership, which frequently meets and consults with Qassem Suleimani, the commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). 

In October, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said it was time for the Iran-backed militias ""to go home"" as the fight against Islamic State was winding down.

The day had extra resonance this year after widespread sexual abuse accusations in Hollywood sparked the #MeToo movement which feminists hope signals one of the most significant shifts toward equal rights in decades. 
In Saudi Arabia, a group of women whooped and cheered as they marked International Women's Day by exercising a recently acquired freedom: the right to go for a jog.
Wearing big smiles and traditional full-length robes adapted for sports, they pounded through sleepy alleys past puzzled shopkeepers in Jeddah's historic district.
Women in the deeply conservative kingdom are hopeful of huge changes. The government introduced physical education for girls last year and began licensing women's sports clubs, but Saudis are still coming around to women running in public. 
""This is just the beginning of a revolution for women in Saudi Arabia. In jobs, in our lives, in society, everything is going to change for Saudi women,"" said one of the joggers, university student Sama Kinsara.
The biggest change yet will come in the summer when Saudi women will be allowed to drive. 
In Spain, women went on a nationwide strike and held hundreds of rallies, closing many main roads and squares.
Their protests included bike rallies, marches, and midnight pot-banging sessions at which they chanted slogans such as ""We continue to fight regardless of the cost!"" and ""Long live the women's struggle"".
The two largest unions said around 6 million women took part. There was no official count.
PAIN AND SORROW
In Turkey's Hatay province, near the Syrian border, women wept as they sat on the ground, their hands bound with scarves, to show solidarity with women imprisoned in Syria. Others waved flags, chanting against President Bashar al-Assad: ""Murderer Assad, evacuate the prisons!"" 
In Manila more than a thousand activists marched, calling President Rodrigo Duterte a ""macho-fascist"" for his lewd comments and treatment of his female critics.
In Iran, where there has been a spate of protests against mandatory Islamic dress, women and men gathered in front of the Ministry of Cooperatives, Labour, and Social Welfare, chanting slogans, videos on social media showed.
""No to gender inequality, No to discriminatory laws"" the women chanted in a video.
The Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI), a New York-based advocacy group, said at least 12 people were arrested. Reuters could not independently verify the reports.
Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi said on Wednesday that one of the girls who removed her veil in Tehran to protest against compulsory hijab has been sentenced to two years in jail.

KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Shokria Jan, a female police officer in southern Afghanistan, is in a small force of women operating in one of the world's most conservative societies and difficult security environments.
Working in the Taliban heartland of Kandahar province, she faces not just danger from insurgent attacks but also heavy pressure from a society in which many believe that women have no place outside the home, let alone in the security forces. 
International Women's Day has been marked in Afghanistan by official speeches and declarations from leaders including President Ashraf Ghani.
But for women like Shokria Jan, the challenges go beyond hopeful words. A widow and a mother of four, she is her family's only breadwinner after her husband, also a police officer, was killed while on duty.
""The Taliban ambushed and killed my husband who was serving in police uniform,"" she said.
""After that, I decided to join the police to earn an income for my four kids as well as to contribute in serving my country. So now I'm serving in the police, the same as my husband.""
Getting more women into the Afghan security forces has been a priority for Ghani's Western-backed government but it has not proved easy, and training facilities for women are limited.
As part of the Afghan National Police strategy, the government intends to recruit an additional 5,000 female police officers over the coming five years. Last year, 190 women were sent to Turkey for training.
Commanders say that female officers play an essential role in areas where men cannot go and in interactions with women at checkpoints. There are now around 110 female officers serving in Kandahar, in locations including the city airport.
""In the past, we did not have female police and we had lots of problems, especially in house searches and similar operations,"" said Abdul Baqi, a local police commander in Kandahar.
For a monthly salary of less than $200, Shokria Jan talks to women, who in the conservative society of southern Afghanistan cannot normally speak to men outside their family. She also conducts the body searches - on women - that have long become part of everyday life for Afghans.
It is an often thankless job but one which she says is more than just a way to earn a living and feed her children.
""I feel I am serving Afghanistan,"" she said.

It said in a statement that it also is offering rewards of $3 million each for information on Abdul Wali, the head of a Pakistani Taliban affiliate, and Mangal Bagh, the leader of an allied Pakistani militant group accused of attacking NATO convoys.
The State Department announcement came as Pakistani Foreign Secretary Tamina Janjua visited Washington for talks with U.S. officials that were expected to focus on improving counter-terrorism cooperation and on U.S. President Donald Trump's strategy for ending the war in Afghanistan.
Washington and Kabul accuse Pakistan of harboring Afghan Taliban and fighters of the allied Haqqani network, a charge that Islamabad denies. Islamabad charges that the Pakistani Taliban maintain sanctuaries in Afghanistan.
U.S. President Donald Trump in January suspended around $2 billion in security assistance to Pakistan, charging that it failed to crackdown on the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network.
In its statement, the State Department said it is offering the rewards for information on the three militant leaders because they pose threats to Pakistan, as well as U.S.-led coalition troops in Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban, whose Urdu name is Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, also has threatened attacks against the U.S. homeland, it said. The group claimed responsibility for a failed May 2010 bomb attack in New York City's Times Square (NYSE:SQ).
The numerous strikes claimed by the group in Pakistan include the October 2012 attempted murder of Yousafzai, then an 11-year-old who advocated education for girls. She received the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize.
Wali is the leader of a TTP affiliate called Jamaat ul-Ahrar, or JUA, which has struck civilians, religious minorities, military personnel and law enforcement officials and killed two local employees of the U.S. Consulate in Peshawar in March 2016, the State Department said.
Mangal Bagh, the department said, leads Lashkar-i-Islam, a TTP ally involved in drug trafficking, smuggling and extorting ""taxes"" on trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The group also has attacked NATO supply convoys plying between Afghanistan and Pakistan's port of Karachi, it said.
""Each of these individuals is believed to have committed, or to pose a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism that threaten the security of the United States and its nationals,"" the department said.

A recently-formed umbrella group called the Broad Front For A Free Venezuela, which includes opposition parties as well as students, union activists and university professors, called for the March 17 demonstration at a Thursday gathering.
The country's main opposition parties, which are boycotting the May 20 vote, stopped calling protests last year after four months of street clashes with security forces left more than 120 people dead but failed to force Maduro's resignation.
    ""We announce the protest against fraud for March 17,"" said Victor Marquez, president of the Association of University Professors, one of the organizations in the umbrella group. He called the May 20 vote an effort to ""prevent the change of president and the socio-political model that causes misery.""
Most opposition parties are boycotting the election on the grounds that it does not provide conditions for a fair vote. 
They note that the two most popular opposition leaders are barred from holding public office, various parties have been outlawed and the election board has consistently favored the ruling Socialist Party.
However, former opposition governor Henri Falcon is running in defiance of the boycott, spurring criticism that he is a Trojan horse for Maduro. Falcon insists he will win and denies that he is colluding with the government.
    Venezuela is suffering an unprecedented crisis as its socialist economic system collapses, leading hundreds of thousands to flee the country as hyperinflation and chronic shortages leave citizens unable to eat or get medical attention. 

Maduro says international media are exaggerating the situation and his country is the victim of an ""economic war"" led by the opposition with the support of Washington.

The aid is part of efforts to strengthen Lebanon's institutions and boost security amid growing internal political tensions. 
The army, one of the few institutions not overtaken by the sectarian divisions that plague Lebanon, has few resources to deal with the instability on its border with Syria, and has been seeking to modernize its hardware.
Lebanon was plunged into crisis in November when Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri abruptly announced his resignation - since withdrawn - thrusting his country to the forefront of a regional tussle between the Sunni monarchy of Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Islamist Iran, whose Lebanese ally Hezbollah is part of the Beirut government.
""The new Saudi leadership doesn't have the same relationship with Lebanon as in the past and no longer wants to invest billions in the country,"" the French official said. 
""So we are in a phase where we are consolidating the situation.""
Lebanon's defense minister was in Paris on Thursday to prepare the first of three conferences aimed at helping different sectors in the country. 
An event on March 15 in Rome is intended to support the army, one on April 6 in Paris to aid the private sector, and another on April 25 in Brussels to address the refugee issue. 
Lebanon is currently hosting around 1.5 million Syrian refugees.

""I always said I trust the judiciary, I always believe in it. I dissented, I did nothing else. If dissent is a crime in a country, that is how guilty I am,"" Tas was quoted by private broadcaster CNNTurk as saying.
The reporters mainly worked for publications that have been closed down by the government for links to the network of the U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen. 
Ankara accuses Gulen of heading the network that orchestrated the 2016 coup attempt, during which 250 people were killed. Gulen has denied involvement.
Authorities have detained 32 members of the Turkish military suspected of links to the Gulen network in an operation centered in the northwestern province of Tekirdag and spread across nine others, Anadolu said on Thursday.
Separately, Istanbul police said they had issued warrants for 121 people suspected of links to the same network and detained 33 of them in the operation spread across 28 other provinces.
More than 50,000 people have been jailed and over 150,000 sacked or suspended from their jobs in crackdown following the failed coup attempt of July 2016.
Critics say President Tayyip Erdogan is using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent. Turkey says the strict measures are necessary because of the security threats it faces.

ROME (Reuters) - Roman Catholic women led by former Irish president Mary McAleese demanded a greater decision-making role for women in the Church on Thursday, urging Pope Francis to tear down its ""walls of misogyny"".
McAleese was the key speaker at a symposium of Catholic women called ""Why Women Matter"", attended by hundreds of people and followed by many others around the world via web-streaming.
The Women's Day event was held at the headquarters of the Jesuit religious order after the Vatican withdrew permission for it to be held inside its walls when organizers added controversial speakers without its permission.
McAleese, who supports gay marriage and the ordination of women as priests, joked about the change of venue to a location just a block away from the Vatican walls, saying: ""I hope all their hearing aids are turned on today"".
She said the Church's ban on a female priesthood had ""locked women out of any significant role in the Church’s leadership, doctrinal development and authority structure"".
The Church teaches that women cannot be ordained priests because Jesus chose only men as his apostles. Those calling for women priests say he was only following the norms of his time.
""We are here to shout, to bring down our Church's walls of misogyny,"" she said, adding that the Church's position on keeping women in a subordinate role to men had ""kept Christ out and bigotry in"". 
""How long can the hierarchy sustain the credibility of a God who wants things this way, who wants a Church where women are invisible and voiceless in Church leadership?"" she said in her address. McAleese was Irish president between 1997 and 2011.
Many women, she said, ""experience the Church as a male bastion of patronizing platitudes, to which Pope Francis has added his quota"".
The pope has promised to put more women in senior positions in the Vatican but critics say he is moving too slowly.
Other women speakers included Zuzanna Radzik, a Catholic theologian from Poland, who described the struggle to make priests and bishops in her homeland take her seriously as an intellectual on a par with men.
Many in the audience were nuns, who cheered on the speakers who demanded more rights for women in the Church.
Last week, a Vatican magazine denounced widespread exploitation of nuns for cheap or free labor in the Roman Catholic Church, saying the male hierarchy should stop treating them like lowly servants.

The article in the monthly ""Women, Church, World"", remarkable for an official Vatican publication, described the drudgery of nuns who cook, clean and wait on tables for cardinals, bishops and priests.

1536,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 03:36PM ET</span>",Myanmar says it would like to see 'clear evidence' of genocide,"By Tom Miles
GENEVA (Reuters) - Myanmar wants to see clear evidence to support accusations that ethnic cleansing or genocide has been perpetrated against its Muslim minority in Rakhine state, National Security Adviser Thaung Tun said on Thursday.
""The vast majority of the Muslim community that was living in Rakhine remain,"" he told reporters in Geneva. ""If it was a genocide, they would all be driven out.”
Nearly 700,000 Rohingya have fled Rakhine into neighboring Bangladesh since insurgent attacks sparked a security crackdown in August, joining 200,000 refugees from a previous exodus.
On Wednesday, U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said he strongly suspected ""acts of genocide"", while Myanmar's military published a lengthy response to widespread allegations over its campaign in Rakhine, saying its investigations had cleared troops of almost all alleged abuses.
Zeid told the U.N. Human Rights Council that reports of bulldozing of alleged mass graves were a ""deliberate attempt by the authorities to destroy evidence of potential international crimes, including possible crimes against humanity"".
Thaung Tun said charges of ethnic cleansing and genocide were very serious and should not be bandied about lightly. 
""We have often heard many accusations that there is ethnic cleansing or even genocide in Myanmar. And I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again – it is not the policy of the government, and this we can assure you. Although there are accusations, we would like to have clear evidence,"" he said.
""We should look into that before making a pronouncement on whether there is ethnic cleansing or genocide.""
Myanmar has not allowed U.N. investigators into the country to investigate. A U.N. fact-finding mission is due to report on Monday on its initial findings, based on interviews with victims and survivors in Bangladesh and other countries.
Thaung Tun added that Myanmar was willing to accept back people who had fled and provide safety and dignity for them, showing that it did not want them out of the country, and that only a minority of Rakhine's population of 3 million had left. 
He said the Muslims who fled largely did so because the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) armed group had sowed fear. He accused ARSA of having forced villagers to join their attacks on the security forces and had insisted on a scorched earth policy, burning villages in retreat.
Rohingya trace their presence in Rakhine back centuries. But most people in majority-Buddhist Myanmar consider them to be unwanted Muslim immigrants from Bangladesh. The army refers to the Rohingya as ""Bengalis,"" and most lack citizenship.
Thaung Tun said former residents would be welcomed back if they were willing to ""participate in the life of the nation"", for example by learning the Burmese language.

""Those who want to become citizens of Myanmar, we are happy to welcome them, but they have to go through a process. There cannot be automatic citizenship,"" he said.

HARARE (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Thursday his country was pursuing military cooperation with Zimbabwe and looking at opportunities in the diamond sector as well as fully implementing a $3 billion joint platinum project near Harare.
Lavrov, who is on a tour of Africa, held meetings with Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa and senior government officials, and signed an agreement to establish a special economic zone for Russian firms to manufacture goods for export.
""We have also talked about prospects for military and technical cooperation. We have a special group working on this particular subject,"" Lavrov told reporters through an interpreter.
Western countries, which had traditionally supplied military equipment to Zimbabwe, including fighter jets and vehicles, stopped in 2000 after imposing sanctions on ex-president Robert Mugabe's government over accusations of human rights abuses.
Chris Mutsvangwa, Mnangagwa's special advisor, later told reporters that Zimbabwe's Ministry of Defence was in talks with Russia over the procurement of military hardware. He did not provide details.
A Russian consortium including arms conglomerate Rostec in 2014 partnered a Zimbabwean group to develop a $3 billion platinum operation near the capital but the project had stalled. 
Lavrov's visit is expected to revive the mining venture, which is one of the single biggest investments the southern African nation has seen since independence in 1980.
""We have laid particular emphasis on implementation of the joint project of exploring the Darwendale platinum deposit, the largest in the world and which is currently operated by a joint venture between Zimbabwe and Russia,"" Lavrov said.
Zimbabwe has the second largest known deposits of platinum after South Africa and the Darwendale project is considered to be the largest single deposit.

Mnangagwa is desperate to attract foreign investors to kickstart the economy and has promised reforms to safeguard investments.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee said Thursday it had sent requests for information to the U.S. Olympic Committee and 48 national governing bodies of various sports and Michigan State University, expanding the committee’s investigation into sexual abuse within organized sports.
A Senate Commerce Committee panel sent a similar request last month as part of a separate investigation. Both committees sent initial letters in January and the House panel has said it plans to convene a hearing on the issue.
""Based on information received to date, the committee is concerned that a pervasive and systemic problem exists in Olympic sports. The safety and well-being of all athletes should be the highest priority of the U.S. Olympic Committee and each of the respective national governing bodies,"" House Republican and Democratic committee leaders said in a joint statement. The letters seek answers by March 21.
The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has also opened an investigation and sent letters seeking more information to various entities including Michigan State.
Congressional committee staff have had briefings with Michigan State and others under investigation.
Last month, U.S. Olympic Committee Chief Executive Scott Blackmun resigned for medical reasons, the organization said on Wednesday, following months of sustained criticism stemming from the sex abuse scandal involving former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar.
The USOC last month outlined reforms aimed at protecting its athletes from abuse.
The scandal prompted the entire board of directors at USA Gymnastics, the sport’s U.S. governing body, to resign, along with the president and athletic director of Michigan State University, where Nassar also worked. It also spawned lawsuits and criminal and civil investigations.
Nassar pleaded guilty to molesting female athletes under the guise of medical treatment and was sentenced to life in prison.
Authorities say Nassar victimized more than 260 women and girls, including several Olympic gold medalists. Nearly 200 of them offered testimony during a pair of sentencing hearings in Michigan earlier this year.
Last month, Senators Jerry Moran, a Republican, and Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, met with a number of former U.S. Olympic athletes to talk about the abuse scandal.

“The young women’s stories we heard today reinforced our determination to root out abuse in youth sport governing bodies,"" the pair said in a joint statement.

1539,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 11:02AM ET</span>","Italy's 5-Star, far right seek partners after election success","ROME (Reuters) - Italy's inconclusive parliamentary election leaves open a wide range of possible alliances, putting the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement in the driver's seat as the largest party.
The election is a political sea change for Italy, with voters shunning the parties that have governed the country in recent years, including the center-left Democratic Party (PD) and Silvio Berlusconi's center-right Forza Italia (Go Italy!).
The actual seats in parliament have yet to be definitively assigned, but results show 5-Star emerged as by far the biggest party with about 32 percent of the national vote.
Preliminary seat allocations for the 630-seat lower house give 5-Star 222-224 seats. A four-party conservative coalition led by the far-right League gets 267, and the center-left bloc dominated by the PD 123-125.
Italy has a long history of finding a way out of political stalemates. It will be up to President Sergio Mattarella to guide talks and name a potential prime minister, but that will not happen before April.
Here are some of the possible scenarios:
5-STAR AND THE LEAGUE
The solution feared most by markets is a marriage between 5-Star and the League. The two would have a parliamentary majority and there are some overlaps in their manifestos, with both calling for tax cuts, greater spending on welfare and a rejection of EU budget rules.
Both used to call for Italy to quit the euro, but while 5-Star says the moment has passed, the League says it still wants to leave the single currency at the earliest politically feasible time. League leader Matteo Salvini last year said he was open to hooking up with 5-Star, but has since said he will not abandon his rightist bloc.
5-STAR AND PD
Five-Star in combination with the PD is another possibility, and one more reassuring for the markets. The PD, which has governed since 2013, has however been the main target of 5-Star's vitriol and there is deep mutual hostility between the two parties. 
The PD's leader Matteo Renzi, who said he would resign after its dismal election showing, ruled out the PD supporting 5-Star and said it would go into opposition. But the party is in such disarray that it is not clear if it will follow its outgoing leader's bidding. 
CENTRE RIGHT WITH SOME OPPONENTS
League leader Salvini says the center right, as the largest coalition, will seek to govern, and claims leadership of the bloc that Berlusconi has steered since 1994. The League took some 17 percent of the overall vote, compared to 14 percent for Berlusconi's Forza Italia.
The center right as a bloc drew 37 percent of the vote promising to loosen the state's purse strings by passing a ""flat tax"" of 23 percent for all households. The center right would need about half the PD's lawmakers to swing to their side in order to have a majority in parliament, and the center-left party may think twice before backing a government led by the far-right League.
ALL IN
The idea of 5-Star, the PD and the main center-right parties all joining together is another option. This would give 5-Star, as the biggest party, a major stake in government, with all parties agreeing before its formation what the government should do while in power. The lifespan of such an administration would be about a year, in theory, though it could end up lasting longer. During the campaign, 5-Star appeared open to such a solution in the case of electoral deadlock, as long as others accepted its conditions.
NEW ELECTIONS

President Mattarella is the man pulling the strings in the post-vote period. He will choose someone to try to form a government as he tried to persuade former rivals to get over the rancor of the campaign. If he fails, he may have no choice but to dissolve parliament and repeat the vote. That is the option the president most wants to avoid, sources told Reuters before the election.

1540,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 11:01AM ET</span>",Menace of Houthi-laid landmines adds to Yemeni misery,"By Aziz El Yaakoubi
AL-MOKHA, Yemen (Reuters) - Yasser Yassin was driving along a road on Yemen's rugged Red Sea coast when a blast sent his Toyota Hilux flying into the air. 
When he regained consciousness, the 30-year-old merchant realized he couldn't move his right leg or see with his right eye.
Yassin's car had hit an anti-tank mine, one of thousands left by Houthi fighters three months earlier when they conceded the al-Khoukha port area to southern Yemeni forces, their civil war adversaries in that part of Yemen.
His recovery has been far from straightforward, despite help from an anti-Houthi military coalition whose leading members are Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. 
""They (coalition) took me to Aden where they fixed my leg, but there was an issue with the metal prosthesis and my leg got infected,"" Yassin, leaning on his crutches, said while visiting al-Mokha hospital for a follow-up after the blast in February.
Yemen has been devastated by three years of conflict in which President Abd-Rabu Mansour Hadi’s government, backed by the Saudi-led Arab coalition, is fighting to drive the Houthis out of cities they seized in 2014 and 2015. 
The United Nations says the war has created the world’s biggest humanitarian crisis, and rights groups say both sides have inflicted indiscriminate violence, including, in the Houthis' case, through the use of banned anti-personnel mines.
Houthi officials did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Both sides in the conflict deny accusations by human rights groups that they have carried out war crimes.
The results of landmine use can be seen in the hallways of the hospital in al-Mokha town, located not far north of the strategic Bab al-Mandab strait, which were crowded with victims and visitors on a recent visit by Reuters.
BURIED RANDOMLY
Doctors and medical staff made their way between armed men to provide first aid to patients wounded by landmines, as well as by shrapnel and mortars.
""I was walking with my brother, I stepped on a mine and it went off,"" said Rashida, a 13-year-old girl fitted with a rudimentary prosthetic leg. 
Her father said she had never attended school because the closest one to their village in Taiz province was 30 km (18 miles) away and had closed down after the Houthis invaded Taiz.
Residents and medics from al-Mokha and nearby villages said landmines had caused more casualties than the fighting in the area, which has seen the Houthis pushed out of some Red Sea coastal areas since 2016. 
The explosives were buried randomly across the region, including in residential areas, playgrounds and under trees where many Yemenis traditionally sit to chew the local mild narcotic qat leaves, they added.
It is not clear how many people have been killed by these weapons, but two doctors and a government official said dozens had died just in the coastal areas of al-Mokha, al-Khoukha and al-Heiss since Houthi forces started withdrawing in early 2017.
The UAE armed forces and Yemeni troops said they harvest between 250 and 300 landmines every week in the western region. More than 40,000 devices have been neutralized since coalition-allied forces took control of the Red Sea coast in a series of battles starting in 2016. 
LOCALLY MADE
Around 90 percent of the landmines were locally made and most of the victims are civilians, they said.
""They also have Russian-made landmines which they took from government warehouses when they invaded the capital Sanaa,"" said an expert in explosives in the UAE armed forces, who declined to be named. 
The UAE has been arming, training and paying thousands of fighters from southern provinces, called the Southern Resistance, to capture western coastal areas and push the Houthi armed movement back to their homeland in the north.
The war is entering its fourth year this month and, despite Houthi losses in parts of western Yemen, they still control Yemen’s most populated areas.
Millions of civilians are trapped under heavy coalition air strikes, as well as a tough crackdown by the Houthis. Famine, cholera and diphtheria affect about eight million people, including two million severely malnourished children.  
Last year, Human Right Watch called on the Houthis to cease using landmines and observe the 1997 Ottawa Convention ban on anti-personnel mines, which took effect in 1999. Yemen signed the treaty in 1998. 
""Most of the victims who survived lost one or two of their legs, and many are crippled and cannot do any physical work,” said Ghassan Massoudi, director of al-Mokha hospital. Massoudi said the military wing of the hospital was treating also civilian landmine victims.
That side of the facility gets most of the attention from the internationally recognized government and the Saudi-led coalition, as it treats fighters from the frontlines in al-Jarahi district -- 90 km (56 miles) away -- where the Southern Resistance and allies from fellow coalition member Sudan face mortar bombs and heaving shelling from the Houthi side.
Yassin said the coalition would not pay for his trip to India -- where many Yemenis seek medical treatment -- when he needed new surgery on his leg and eye, as he was not a fighter.
So he paid his own way.
""I sold the remains of the car, my mother and wife's gold and went to India where I spent $8,500. I still lost my eye,"" he said.

Ezz paid 1.7 billion Egyptian pounds ($96.8 million) to authorities in a deal reached to settle the case, the sources said. He had already been released on bail in July.
Ezz, the former owner of Ezz Steel Co, was charged after Egypt's 2011 popular uprising with using his position as a leading official in former president Hosni Mubarak's dissolved National Democratic Party (NDP) to make illegitimate gains of about five billion Egyptian pounds.
The sources gave no further details about why the case was dropped.
Ezz is one of many close associates of Mubarak to have faced embezzlement charges, several of whom have also had charges or trials dropped. A court in January quashed the conviction and prison sentence of ex-interior minister Habib al-Adly and ordered a retrial.
Mubarak, a former air force commander, was last year cleared of all charges brought against him after the uprising, including the killing of protesters and corruption.
Senior military officers have dominated Egypt's politics and large chunks of its economy for decades. A year after Mubarak's overthrow in 2011, the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi won a presidential election. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, then military commander, led the overthrow of Mursi in 2013 after popular protests, and took office a year later.
Sisi is running for re-election later this month in a vote he is virtually guaranteed to win.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Brexit negotiations risk stalling if Britain does not present a realistic solution for the future of the Irish border after London rejected an EU fallback proposal last week, European Council President Donald Tusk said on Thursday.
Britain's government has said it does not want a customs union with the EU, without which the EU says it would need to regulate Northern Ireland's trade to avoid a return of customs checks.
However British leader Theresa May, backed by her hardline pro-British Northern Irish parliamentary allies, said that no prime minister could ever agree to such terms as they would ""threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK"".
""When I was in London last week, I heard very critical comments by Prime Minister May, and others, about the way the Irish border issue was presented in the draft Withdrawal Agreement,"" Tusk told a joint news conference with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in Dublin.
""While we must respect this position, we also expect the UK to propose a specific and realistic solution to avoid a hard border. As long as the UK doesn't present such a solution, it is very difficult to imagine substantive progress in Brexit negotiations.
""If in London someone assumes that the negotiations will deal with other issues first, before moving to the Irish issue, my response would be: 'Ireland first'.""
Northern Ireland will have the UK's only land border with the EU after Brexit, and Varadkar has also urged May to spell out her proposals.
He said on Wednesday that Dublin must have certainty that if a better option is not available, Brussels' proposal to establish a ""common regulatory area"" between the island of Ireland and the 26 other EU states will apply.
Addressing comments by British finance minister Philip Hammond on Wednesday arguing for a bespoke deal or an ambitious free trade agreement covering financial services, Tusk said the EU cannot offer the same in services trade as it could in goods.
He said unlike with the trade of goods, services are about ensuring common rules, common supervision and common enforcement and that is why free trade agreements do not have detailed rules for financial services.

""We should all be clear that also when it comes to financial services, life will be different after Brexit,"" Tusk said.

Mattarella, who is usually limited to a ceremonial role but must now step into the political ring and broker a deal between rivals, made the appeal in his first public address since Sunday's vote delivered a hung parliament.
""We - and this means everyone - still need and will always need this approach: a sense of responsibility that allows us to make the general interest of the country and its citizens the priority,"" Mattarella said in a speech at the presidential palace in Rome.
No party or group won an absolute majority, pitching Italy into political uncertainty just as European authorities warned against ramping up spending and driving higher Europe's second-biggest debt as a percentage of output.
A right-wing alliance dominated by the euroskeptic League won the most seats, followed by the anti-system 5-Star Movement, which emerged as the biggest single party by a wide margin.
Both 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio and the League's Matteo Salvini have laid claim to the prime minister's job. But the final decision rests with the often-inscrutable president, who must persuade bitter rivals to find common ground and work together to form a government. 
Ahead of the vote, all the main parties pledged to cut taxes, hike spending and raise the budget deficit from levels agreed with the EU, while simultaneously promising to cut debt.
Aware that the threat of deterioration in Italy's public finances could weigh on the euro, the EU's executive also had a word of warning for Italy's leaders on Thursday. 

""Especially for Italy, a country that has the second-highest debt-to-GDP ratio after Greece in the EU, it's important to stay on course as regards responsible fiscal policies,"" European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said.

AWLAD SERAG, Egypt (Reuters) - In a tiny village in Egypt's southern province of Assiut, 16-year-old Amany Shamekh, who wants to be an artist one day, recalls how she was illegally circumcised with a razor blade. 
""The midwife came to the house, my mother took off my underwear and the lady said 'hang in there',"" said Shamekh who grew up in the village of Awlad Serag.
""I felt the razor-blade, and when I saw the blood on the midwife's hands I was going to die. I spent around a month unable to go to the bathroom because the wound hurt very much if it came in contact with water."" 
Genital cutting of girls was banned in Egypt in 2008 and criminalized in 2016. But the practise often referred to as female genital mutilation (FGM) or circumcision remains a rite of passage and is often viewed as a way to promote chastity.
Villagers say husbands prefer wives to be cut and often ask young brides to undergo the procedure before their wedding.
""Every girl must be circumcised so she can get married,"" said Amany's mother Zeinab, who is 51. ""It's our ... tradition."" 
The procedure is performed on both Muslim and Christian girls in Egypt and Sudan, but is rare elsewhere in the Arab world. It is also common in Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia.
A 2016 survey by the U.N. Children's Fund showed that 87 percent of women and girls aged 15-49 in Egypt have undergone the procedure.
According to the World Health Organization, more than 200 million girls and women have been cut in 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
In the neighboring village of El-Wasata, Esraa Salah, 15, said her only memories of the night she was circumcised were the embarrassment at being naked before the doctor, fear when her mother and grandmother held her legs apart and extreme pain.
""A girl's refusal of circumcision is useless because the decision is made since she is born. All a girl can do is to pray that god eases the pain of the operation,"" Nada Salah, Esraa's 14-year-old sister said. 
Their grandmother, Mageda, said the practise cannot be stopped because it protects a girl's chastity.

One of Mageda's daughters contracted an infection after she was circumcised and cannot bear children. When asked about why she would allow the same to happen to her granddaughters Mageda said: ""My dear, it's all fate"".

NAQOURA, Lebanon (Reuters) - Lebanon and Israel have been holding talks nearly every day over a border dispute that has raised tensions between the two enemy states, according to the U.N. peacekeeping force on the frontier that is mediating their discussions. 
""There is a full engagement from all the sides and there have been meetings almost on a daily basis. The dialogue is open. No one has ever walked out from these meetings,"" said Andrea Tenenti, spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). 
Tensions have spiked recently over an Israeli border wall, Lebanese offshore energy exploration, and the growing arsenal of Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group, which Israel sees as the biggest threat on its frontier.
Lebanon, Israel and UNIFIL were already holding three-way talks every few weeks in a building on the border near the peacekeepers' base at Naqoura in southern Lebanon. They are now being held more often, Tenenti said, along with indirect talks conducted through UNIFIL. 
Israel is building a border wall near the Blue Line, as the frontier demarcation between the two countries in lieu of a formal border agreement is known.
Lebanon has described the wall as an ""aggression"", saying it intrudes into Lebanese territory. Israel says the wall will be entirely on its side of the Blue Line and in Israeli territory.
At the same time, Lebanon has begun oil and gas exploration in a block that includes a small area of sea along the maritime frontier that is claimed by Israel. 
""There is a will to keep this dialogue open ... I think now, beside the heightened rhetoric, the reality on the ground is different and there is no appetite for instability or for war,"" Tenenti said.
BLUE LINE
Reuters footage from a recent trip to the border area showed construction work in areas along the Blue Line, including cranes erecting concrete blocks and bulldozers working at a fence.
Israel occupied southern Lebanon from 1982 to 2000 and in 2006 it waged a month-long war against Hezbollah there. Israel says the Shi'ite Muslim group has grown stronger due to its role in the Syrian civil war, and has attacked it there. 
""The last 12 years have seen the quietest period the south of Lebanon has witnessed in over 30 years,"" Tenenti said. 
""But it is important to keep in mind that things along the Blue Line are in general very sensitive. Anything could, if it is not addressed immediately, potentially spark into something bigger and increase tension.""
For Abu Moussa Taher, 77, a shop owner in Naqoura, the idea of a new war seems distant.
""It is impossible, I think. When you think of a war, you have to think of its consequences,"" said Taher, who says he has witnessed all of the wars to hit the area since 1978.

The young man, who was first detained on Feb. 13 by local authorities in Frankfurt, had stockpiled a large number of powerful fireworks in his apartment in the German state of Hessen, and planned to extract their explosive powder. 
Prosecutors said the suspect, identified only as Deday A. in line with German privacy rules, is also suspected of being a member of the jihadist group Islamic State. 
The Iraqi suspect was first detained and then arrested in Frankfurt, but the investigation was later elevated to the chief federal prosecutor's office given the serious nature of the allegations.

When she became Belgium's first female Federal Police commissioner in 2012, de Bolle said she had thought ""the glass ceiling was broken"" but she acknowledged that there was still a persistent gender imbalance in her field. 
""I have always been the first (woman) in most of the jobs I have done,"" she told EU ministers at Thursday's Justice and Home Affairs Council.
Her biggest challenge at Europol would be to balance the needs of individual member states with those of the bloc's institutions, she said.
De Bolle's appointment falls on International Women's Day, an annual celebration of the movement for women's rights.

She takes over from Rob Wainwright at the European Union's law enforcement agency on May 1.

1549,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 09:21AM ET</span>",Colombia's FARC candidate out of presidential race due to ill health,"((In March 8 item, corrects name of group to ""Revolutionary Alternative Common Force"" from ""Revolutionary Armed Common Force"" in paragraph 11.))
BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's former FARC rebels will not field a candidate in the country's May presidential election as its hopeful, Rodrigo Londono, battles heart problems, the group said on Thursday.
The group will, however, have candidates in Sunday's congressional election, its first outing as an unarmed political party, after it demobilized under a 2016 peace deal with the government.
Known by his nom de guerre Timochenko, Londono had been the FARC's bet to replace President Juan Manuel Santos when the latter leaves office in August, but heart surgery on Wednesday has put him out of the race. 
The group said attacks by the right wing, including protests at their events, were a further reason for pulling out of the presidential election. 
Londono canceled campaigning last month after his motorcade was pelted with tomatoes and eggs by angry protesters.
""The surgery which took place yesterday, combined with already discussed features of the electoral campaign, has led us to decline our presidential aspirations,"" FARC senate candidate Ivan Marquez said, reading from a statement.
Marquez said the group was open to backing a presidential candidate from a different party if that person supports the peace deal.
Seventy-four FARC candidates for the lower and upper house of Congress will run in legislative elections on Sunday. The group is guaranteed 10 seats in the body through 2026 under the terms of the peace deal.
The Shaio clinic said in a statement Londono is under observation and had also been suffering a pulmonary sickness and an obstructed cerebral artery. 
The former FARC commander was unlikely to have garnered many votes from Colombians, many of whom believe its leaders should be in prison, not running for office. Recent polls have shown him with a maximum of 1 percent support. 
Voters, analysts and even Santos himself have scoffed at the group's decision to keep its infamous Spanish acronym for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia by naming its political party the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force.
Though the FARC had many youthful and perhaps less controversial fighters in their ranks, its congressional hopefuls are largely grizzled ex-commanders, shorn of the beards they wore in rebel camps and wearing loafers instead of rubber boots. 
The choice to back candidates until now best known by Colombians for gun battles, kidnapping for ransom and setting land mines, is seen by many as a missed opportunity for the FARC to reinvent itself.
""It's important that they're now not at war, but really they won't have much impact on elections,"" analyst Juan Carlos Palou said. ""And anyway they don't have any attractive or innovative ideas.""
The group could possibly still win support from poor, rural communities which lack good roads, schools and basic services.
It is unclear whether remaining left-wing presidential candidates will want the FARC's backing, though all are staunch supporters of the peace deal.

FARC leaders have expressed fear of a systematic campaign to assassinate their members, as happened with other leftist movements in the country. More than 50 party members and relatives have been killed since the accord was signed, the group says.

LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met the head of the Anglican church in London on Thursday and promised to promote interfaith dialogue as part of his domestic reforms, the British faith leader's office said.
Prince Mohammed is making an official visit to London to promote Saudi Arabia as a tolerant, modernizing economy and build a wider trade and investment relationship with Britain, a long-term defense ally.
On the second full day of his first foreign tour since becoming heir apparent to the Saudi throne last year, Prince Mohammed also had meetings with finance minister Philip Hammond, bankers and lawmakers, and was due to dine with Prime Minister Theresa May at her country residence later.
State oil giant Saudi Aramco, whose lucrative stock market listing Britain is vying with the United States to attract, signed a preliminary deal to pursue international gas opportunities with Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa).
Prince Mohammed began the day with a symbolic visit to Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, spiritual leader of the Anglican Communion of millions of Christians globally, at Lambeth Palace in central London.
""The Crown Prince made a strong commitment to promote the flourishing of those of different faith traditions, and to interfaith dialogue within the Kingdom and beyond,"" a statement from Lambeth Palace said.
""The Archbishop shared his concern about limits placed on Christian worship in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and highlighted the importance for leaders of all faiths to support freedom of religion or belief, drawing on the experience of the UK.""
Saudi Arabia does not tolerate non-Muslims practicing their faith publicly, forcing Christians to risk arrest by praying in private homes.
YEMEN CONFLICT
Prince Mohammed and Welby viewed early texts from the Christian, Muslim and Jewish faiths, including fragments of a Koran manuscript found in a Birmingham University library in 2015 that is thought to be among the world's oldest.
Earlier this week, Prince Mohammed met Coptic Pope Tawadros II at Cairo's largest Coptic cathedral, part of his drive to rid the Gulf Arab kingdom of its reputation as a global exporter of an ultra-conservative brand of Islam.
Welby also ""voiced his distress"" at the humanitarian situation in Yemen, the statement said. A Saudi-led coalition is fighting a war in Yemen in which 10,000 people have died and 8.3 million people have been left dependent on food aid.
May, whose government has drawn widespread criticism for approving 4.6 billion pounds ($6.35 billion) worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia, was likely to repeat her own concerns over the humanitarian situation in Yemen during a private dinner.
That criticism over the Yemen war and noisy demonstrations have contrasted with the warm welcome from the British government given the crown prince. 
On Wednesday, Prince Mohammed met Queen Elizabeth for lunch and later met May to agree to target a 65 billion pound ($90 billion) increase in trade and investment ties.
A government spokeswoman said Prince Mohammed met with Hammond on Thursday, and two sources said there was also a meeting with  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) group chief executive Bill Winters and HSBC CEO John Flint. No further details of either meeting were available.

1552,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 08:10AM ET</span>",Senior South African MP says believes politics delayed Gupta case,"By Joe Brock
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A South African lawmaker leading an investigation into accusations that businessmen used links with ex-president Jacob Zuma to win contracts said on Thursday he suspected prosecutors had delayed taking action over the case for political reasons.
Mathole Motshekga said most members of the parliamentary investigative committee he chaired believed the state prosecution service had held up the case until it was sure Zuma would not be replaced by a close ally in a party leadership election in December.
""This is a very serious matter. It would mean people were serving political interests rather than serving the public,"" he said.
The head of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), Shaun Abrahams, dismissed Motshekga's assertion on Thursday, telling Reuters: ""There was no political influence whatsoever. There's no evidence to that effect."" 
Zuma resigned last month, ending nine scandal-plagued years in power overshadowed by accusations by opposition politicians that his businessmen friends the Gupta brothers had used their link with him to win millions of dollars of state contracts. 
Both Zuma and the Guptas have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. 
Zuma was replaced by Cyril Ramaphosa who promised to fight corruption. Ramaphosa had already become the leader of the ruling African National Congress party after narrowly defeating Zuma's ex-wife and preferred successor, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, in December.
DAIRY CASE RAID
On the same day as Zuma's resignation, police raided a Gupta family home in a case relating to a state-funded dairy farm that prosecutors say was a front to extract millions of dollars of taxpayers' money.
That first raid connected to the case happened almost five years after the first allegations of wrongdoing in the dairy farm contract appeared in South African media.
Motshekga's parliamentary committee which is investigating the Gupta case questioned Abrahams of the National Prosecuting Authority on Wednesday about why it took so long to investigate the case.
Motshekga told Reuters on Thursday that - after hearing Abrahams' testimony - the committee believed there were political motives behind the delay in taking action over the dairy farm.
""This was the view of the majority of members of the committee,"" Motshekga said.
Motshekga said the Hawks - an elite police unit - told the committee it gave the NPA crime documents including evidence related to the case in October last year but the NPA took no action. 
Abrahams told the committee the documents were incomplete, hence the delay.
But Motshekga said committee members suspected the NPA was waiting for the result of an ANC leadership contest.

""It raises suspicions that if there had been a different outcome in that ANC conference then information would have been suppressed,"" Motshekga said.

""For this past 13 months we have been unable to form a devolved government. I really regret that. Given everything that happened over the past couple of weeks, I see little prospect of it being returned in the coming weeks or months,"" she said in a speech to the British Chambers of Commerce.
Foster, whose party supports Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative government, added that she was disappointed that a return to violence in Northern Ireland had been raised in Brexit talks by those with little knowledge of the region.
""I do object in the strongest terms to people who have limited experience of the 'Troubles' in Northern Ireland throwing threats of violence around as some kind of bargaining chip in the negotiating process,"" she said. ""To do so is an insult to the people of Northern Ireland.""

The province has been without a devolved executive for over a year since Irish nationalists Sinn Fein withdrew from the compulsory power-sharing government with the DUP, their arch-rivals. The executive is central to a 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of violence.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani activist who mysteriously disappeared in January last year has now contacted his family and is expected to return home soon, his brother said on Thursday. 
Social activist Samar Abbas disappeared while visiting the capital, Islamabad, along with four other men who were picked up from different cities in the span of a few days. 
""He is in contact but not at home,"" Samar Abbas's brother, Ashar Abbas, told Reuters, adding that his brother resurfaced two days ago. 
The other men returned after five weeks and have since fled the country due to a widespread campaign that erupted in their absence alleging they were behind online blogs that carried blasphemous content.
Blasphemy is a highly charged allegation in Pakistan where insulting the Prophet Muhammad is punishable by death and even being accused could lead to mob violence and lynchings. Right groups say the law is frequently abused to settle personal scores. 
Two of the men, Waqass Goraya and Aasim Saeed, have since said they were tortured by intelligence agencies. A third, prominent poet and playwright Salman Haider, tweeted about being tortured by his captors. 
The military denied the accusations.
Abbas declined to comment on whether his brother had mentioned his whereabouts for the past 14 months. 
In December, Raza Mehmood Khan, 40, a member of Aghaz-i-Dosti (Start of Friendship) that works to build peace between arch-rivals Pakistan and India, was kidnapped by armed men.
His family has since filed a writ of habeas corpus in a court in the eastern city of Lahore in the belief he has been unlawfully detained.
On the day of his disappearance, Khan had spoken at a forum on militancy and also posted comments on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) critical of the military and its suspected link to some Islamist hardliners who at the time were protesting against the civilian government.
In May, Pakistani officials launched a crackdown on online criticism of its military, with security officials scrutinizing up to 200 social media accounts.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland is developing a remotely-detonated mine designed to deter enemies with its ""horror"", the country's defense minister said on Thursday, referring to a device that springs into the air and fires projectiles at its target when triggered.
Defence Minister Jussi Niinisto said the defense forces were developing the so-called bounding mine to replace landmines banned by a 1999 international treaty. Its main targets would be soldiers and vehicles.
""This is a remotely tripped explosive, which bounds in the air and fires steel or tungsten bullets downwards,"" the minister told reporters.
""This gives quite a good regional effect and deterrence effect, the so called mine horror. This is being tested now."" 
In 2011, Finland became the last European Union country to ratify the 1999 Ottawa Convention, which prohibits the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel landmines.
Finland's ratification has lately come in for criticism domestically from some Finns who argue landmines could be effective in defending the country's long borders. 
Finland shares a 1,340km (833 miles) border and a difficult history with Russia, and following Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014, it has stepped up military spending.
Niinisto said he was not aware of a similar explosive being used somewhere else, and the Finnish weapon would always be fired by its operator. 
According to the Ottawa Treaty, the launcher of such a mine must have direct visual contact with the location upon triggering it, a ministry official specified. The mines banned by the convention involve explosives set off by the proximity of, or contact with, the target.
""This is an explosive that fits well into the Finnish terrain... traditional mines explode upwards or sideways. This fires downwards, so it is more difficult to take cover from it,"" Niinisto said.
He added that he had seen international interest for the weapon.
Niinisto, who considers the ratification of the Ottawa convention to have been a mistake, also said that Finland could relinquish the landmine ban during a crisis where ""all agreements have become meaningless papers"".
Finland has compulsory military service for all men and it is one of six members of the EU that have not also joined NATO.
In recent years, however, it has forged closer ties with the Western military alliance, while stepping defense cooperation with other Nordic countries. 

While backed by most countries, the Ottawa treaty has not been signed by a number of countries including the United States, China, India, and Russia.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech President Milos Zeman will be sworn in for a second term on Thursday, and may feel he has a freer hand in his final period in office to promote his Moscow-friendly and anti-immigration views.
Zeman, the last prominent politician from the country's post-communist transition days in the 1990s, won re-election in January with his anti-immigrant rhetoric and courtship of eastern powers like China and Russia.
The 73-year-old trained economist and former center-left prime minister promised he would unite society when taking office five years ago.
Instead he has proved a polarizing force, belittling his opponents and sniping at intellectual elites and the media. 
He was one of the few European politicians to back Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
He has also shifted further right on issues like immigration amid a refugee crisis in Europe. The Czechs have joined others in central Europe in refusing to take in refugees.
In January, Zeman defeated pro-European Union academic Jiri Drahos in a vote reflecting concerns over security despite a period of fast economic growth and rising wages. 
The result also helped Prime Minister Andrej Babis, who had backed Zeman.
Babis was the runaway winner in October parliamentary elections, but he is still searching for support for a government after his minority cabinet lost a confidence vote in January.
Zeman has promised Babis time for a second attempt and could exert some influence over his former party the Social Democrats, who have started talks with Babis's ANO party. 
Political analyst Stanislav Balik said that with Zeman not able to run again for after his two terms, he may be even more forceful with his views. Balik said missing inauguration invitations for some officials who opposed him in the past was evidence.
""The inauguration already shows that he does not seek any reconciliation, that he keeps alive his petty quarrels,"" he said. ""He just does what he thinks is right and also what his inner circle pushes him to do.""
Zeman has upset many with his courtship of eastern powers like China and Russia. He has warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has called to end EU sanctions imposed on Moscow over its annexation of Crimea.
Like Trump, Zeman advocates moving his country's embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, although that decision lies with the government.

His stance toward Brussels has also been lukewarm. He calls himself a federalist and supports membership in the EU but he also favours holding an in-or-out referendum on membership like the one that led to Britain's impending exit from the bloc.

1559,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 11:26AM ET</span>",New York plan puts spotlight on graying of U.S. prison population,"By Mark Miller
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Does it make financial and moral sense to keep elderly people in prison? The state of New York is asking that question this month, and the debate there should be a harbinger of a much-needed national conversation. 
The American prison population is getting older. The number of prisoners serving longer sentences has risen, and there has been an increase in admissions of older people, according to a 2016 study by the U.S. Department of Justice. Eleven percent of the U.S. state and federal prison population was over age 55 in 2016.
That translates to roughly 160,000 people - and 38,000 people over age 65. The American Civil Liberties Union projects that by 2030, more than one-third of the U.S. prison population will be over age 55 - more than 400,000 people.
This elder incarceration boom poses serious moral and ethical questions. What is the purpose of keeping people in prison well beyond the point where they pose risks to society, beyond raw punishment? And keeping the elderly locked up is much more expensive than younger inmates, due mainly to the cost of medication and other healthcare services.
In 2015-2016, the cost of healthcare in New York State prisons totaled $380.6 million, up 20 percent from three years earlier. States bear the entire cost of prisoners’ healthcare, since the incarcerated are not eligible to participate in Medicaid, which is funded jointly by the states and federal government.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has proposed a “geriatric parole” program for prisoners over age 55 as part of a broader criminal justice reform plan that is under discussion as part of the state’s budget process this year. Prisoners who suffer from serious illness and cannot take care of themselves would be eligible for the program if they have served at least half of their sentences. Those convicted of murder or aggravated murder, and inmates serving life without parole, would not be eligible. 
Prison reform advocates say the plan is a step in the right direction but does not go far enough. Release Aging People in Prison (RAPP), a New York-based advocacy group, estimates the Cuomo plan would affect fewer than 1,000 prisoners, because it excludes some people based on their crime, no matter how ill they might be. “It guarantees that some people will die in prison, no matter what their condition,” said Laura Whitehorn, a formerly incarcerated woman who is now an organizer with the group.
And that is where this issue gets really difficult. The national debate about ending mass incarceration often focuses on reducing arrest and incarceration of nonviolent drug offenders. But the elderly prison population is composed largely of violent offenders. Advocates like Whitehorn are pushing for parole reforms that would at least give these prisoners an opportunity for review of their cases to assess what risk - if any - they pose to the community.
LOW RATES OF RECIDIVISM
Very few older prisoners commit crimes after they are released. In New York state, just 5 percent of released prisoners aged 50 to 64 return to prison for new offenses; among those aged 65 or higher, the rate of new offense is just six-tenths of 1 percent. (The numbers are higher when parole violations are included.) Among offenders convicted of murder, just 1.9 percent committed new crimes following release from 1985 to 2012, according to state data.
In New York state, the overall prison population fell 17 percent from 2007 through 2016 to about 52,000, according to a report last year by the New York State Comptroller. At the same time, the number of inmates aged 50 or higher rose by 46 percent, to more than 10,000. The report does not cite specific figures for the cost of healthcare for older inmates, but overall healthcare expenses for the state's prison population in 2015-2016 were 20 percent higher than three years earlier.
Prison accelerates the aging process - research shows that inmates often are 10 years older from a physiological standpoint than their actual ages. And they get sicker at earlier ages than the general population, with higher overall rates of cognitive impairment and dementia, in particular. The Supreme Court last week agreed to hear the case of an Alabama inmate on death row who suffers from dementia and can no longer recall the crime or murder conviction that sent him there. (http://reut.rs/2oPr1JH).
Just as difficult are the questions about how to provide housing, healthcare and even a basic income to elderly prisoners upon release. In New York state, many ex-offenders wind up in homeless shelters or on the streets. Very often, they do not have sufficient working history to qualify for Medicare or Social Security - and those still on parole are not eligible for Medicare.
Many parolees are eligible for Medicaid, but most face big challenges navigating the healthcare system. “People are not released with any experience using our medical system,” said Elizabeth Gaynes, CEO of the Osborne Association, a New York-based criminal justice reform group.
Osborne, which runs a broad array of programs to help prisoners coming home, is developing an “elder re-entry initiative” that assesses the health of prisoners before release, helps prepare them for life on the outside and connects them to needed services.
But transition programs will not do much good unless political leaders step up to the plate on the tough questions concerning incarceration of the elderly.
“We need to ask what is the purpose of incarceration?” said Whitehorn. “If political leaders want to get us out of the morass of mass incarceration, they can’t keep doing the things that got us into it. If they do want to change this, they have to show some backbone and go by the science, the evidence and the truth.”

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki on Thursday defended to the European Union's executive court reforms made by his ruling nationalists and warned that too much criticism from the bloc could backfire.
Morawiecki is meeting European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker, the latest high-level contact between Warsaw and Brussels in recent months aimed at resolving a dispute over EU concerns about democracy in Poland.
Juncker offered a brief bear hug on receiving Morawiecki, who is presenting Warsaw's 'white paper' on the judicial overhaul.
The overhaul has been criticized by civil society campaigners, international democracy watchdogs, the EU and opposition parties in Poland for making the courts submit to more government control. 
The document says the reforms were needed to improve efficiency and remove judges ""entangled in dishonorable service"" in Poland's communist government, which fell in 1989.
But it also warns western, more liberal EU states not to push Warsaw too much on the issue because of ""strengthening anti-European sentiment that has been more ... apparent for the last years.""
""It can lead to the growth of populist political forces, seeking to dismantle or weaken ... the European Union,"" said the document, circulated by the Polish government. An EU spokeswoman later said the bloc had received it and dialogue would continue.
Brussels last year launched a scheme to penalize Warsaw and force it to change tack on its media and court reforms imposed since the Law and Justice (PiS) party took power in 2015. 
Hungary, a euroskeptic Polish ally, has vowed to block what could be the top sanction under the so-called Article 7 procedure - stripping Poland of its vote on EU affairs. 
But even the fact the threat is on the table and being debated by the other 27 EU states is an embarrassment for Warsaw, which views itself as a leader of ex-communist EU countries.
The Polish document says triggering Article 7 was not justified and for now, Morawiecki has won time with the bloc by reopening dialogue with the EU on the matter. Poland is also at odds with the bloc EU over migration and environment policies. 
Poland's new willingness to talk came as the EU is embarking on difficult negotiations over its next, long-term budget and some net payers want to cut the bloc's generous handouts to countries not respecting the bloc's fundamental values.
Poland is currently the main beneficiary of EU money and risks losing billions of euros in the dispute over the rule of law.
The EU's management of euroskeptic and populist governments, including in member states like Poland and Hungary, has emerged as a key challenge for the bloc after Brexit.

Jean-Yves Le Drian flew to Tehran on Monday with a brief to reaffirm European support for a 2015 nuclear deal that opened up Iran's economy while echoing U.S. concern about Tehran's missile program and its influence in the region.
""European countries come (to Tehran) and say we want to negotiate with Iran over its presence in the region. It is none of your business. It is our region. Why are you here?"" Khamenei was quoted as saying by his official website.
Khamenei, a Shi'ite cleric who is Iran's ultimate authority on all major matters of state, said the Islamic Republic would only negotiate on that issue with other states in the region. 
Iran's Revolutionary Guards have sent weapons and thousands of soldiers to Syria to prop up President Bashar al-Assad in the country's seven-year-long civil war. Israel has accused Tehran of seeking a permanent military presence in Syria.
Khamenei described the presence of U.S. military forces in various regions of the world as ""malicious and seditious"" and said Iran would not ask for permission from Washington to be active in the Middle East.
""We will negotiate with America when we want to be present in America,"" he said.
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to pull Washington out of Iran's nuclear agreement with world powers, forged before he took office, unless three European signatories help ""fix"" the accord by forcing Tehran to limit its sway in the Middle East and rein in its ballistic missile program.
French President Emmanuel Macron has criticized the program and raised the possibility of new sanctions.
Iran has one of the Middle East’s largest missile programs and some of its precision-guided missiles have the range to strike Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed Tehran's military activities in the region with Trump in Washington this week.
Iran has also been aiding the Shi'ite-led government of Iraq in its fight against the Sunni militant Islamic State group.
Iranian Defence Minister Amir Hatami was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency Tehran was also ready to offer ""military advisory and security"" help to Afghanistan in that state's fight against terrorism - an allusion to the Islamic State fighters and also Sunni Taliban insurgents.
President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday that Iran's military might posed no threat to any country in the region.

1563,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 06:30AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Congo presidential election on course for December, says prime minister","By Helen Reid and Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - An election in the Democratic Republic of Congo to replace President Joseph Kabila remains on course for late December, the central African country's Prime Minister, Bruno Tshibala, has said. 
""I committed in front of our country's representatives in May last year to my mission which was to bring the Congolese people to elections this year, and I confirm that in December this year the Congolese people will be brought to the ballot boxes,"" Tshibala told Reuters in an interview late on Wednesday.
Repeated stalling of the election has raised tensions across the vast central African country, triggering street protests and encouraging armed rebellions. Kabila was due to step down when his mandate expired at the end of 2016 but has so far refused to do so.
""There were setbacks which caused this delay,"" said Tshibala. ""But this time our course is set for elections and they will take place on December 23.""
Tshibala, a former leading member of Congo's main opposition coalition, was appointed by Kabila just under a year ago to head a transitional 'unity' government tasked with organizing the election. He is expected to be the opposition candidate in the election.
When asked about technical problems experienced by voting machines during recent testing in the capital Kinshasa, Tshibala said: ""Machines are a great revolution,"" adding they would help the election to run smoothly and in record time.
""We have taken all the precautions with the electoral commission for it to go well. It's true that it's a vast country... but that's exactly why the voting machines will help improve the process.""
Opponents of current president Kabila, who has ruled Congo since his father’s assassination in 2001, suspect he intends to repeatedly delay elections until he can organize a referendum to let himself stand for a third term, as his counterparts in neighboring Congo Republic and Rwanda have done.
Kabila denies those charges, saying the election delays are due to challenges registering millions of voters and budgetary constraints.
DRC security forces have killed dozens of civilians in protests over election delays over the last two years. Worsening militia violence has meanwhile raised fears of a backslide toward the civil wars of the turn of the century that killed millions.
The country's economic situation is still difficult. The central bank currently predicts inflation of 38 percent for the end of 2018, and Tshibala said the country is prepared to cooperate with international financial institutions.
""We are making an internal effort to improve tax collection and government receipts,"" said Tshibala. 
""If we find ourselves in a difficult situation we won't hesitate to speak to the international financial institutions to provide a supplement in order to improve our functioning as a state.""
Congo, which is the same size as western Europe, has plentiful resources. It is Africa's largest copper producer and is the source of more than half the world's cobalt, a vital ingredient in mobile phone and electric vehicle batteries.
Its output jumped 15.5 percent last year and President Kabila held a nearly-six hour meeting with international mining companies on Wednesday on new mining laws that will increase the revenues DRC gets from the firms. [nL5N1QP71S]

""There will be a revision of the code to try and make it more attractive and fair to the DRC. There will be a compromise between us and the mining companies,"" Tshibala said.

1564,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 09:13PM ET</span>",Britain will respond if Russia is proved to be behind nerve attack: PM May,"By Estelle Shirbon
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will respond appropriately if evidence shows Moscow was behind a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter in England, Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday.
Former double agent Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, have been in hospital since they were found unconscious on Sunday on a bench outside a shopping center in the quiet cathedral city of Salisbury.
""We will do what is appropriate, we will do what is right, if it is proved to be the case that this is state-sponsored,"" May told  ITV  (LON:ITV) News, when asked whether Britain could expel the Russian ambassador.
""But let's give the police the time and space to actually conduct their investigation,"" she added, in her first comments on the attack since police said on Wednesday a nerve agent was used. 
Government experts have identified the substance, which will help identify the source, but have not made the information public.
""Of course, if action needs to be taken, then the government will do that. We'll do that properly, at the right time, and on the basis of the best evidence,"" May said.
Both victims remain unconscious, in a critical but stable condition, while police officer Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who was also harmed by the substance, remains in a serious condition.
""He's well, he's sat up. He's not the Nick that I know but of course he's receiving a high level of treatment,"" said Kier Pritchard, head of Wiltshire Police, after visiting Bailey in a hospital intensive care unit.
""He's very anxious, he's very concerned. He did his very best on that night.""
A total of 21 people had been treated in hospital following the incident, Pritchard said.
""BRAZEN AND RECKLESS""
In parliament, several lawmakers defied interior minister Amber Rudd's plea to avoid speculation about who was responsible for the ""brazen and reckless act"". Some called for investigations to be re-opened into the deaths of Russian exiles in Britain in recent years. 
Rudd urged people to keep a cool head and focus on the Salisbury incident.
""This was attempted murder in the most cruel and public way. We will respond in a robust and appropriate manner once we ascertain who was responsible,"" Rudd said. 
""We are committed to do all we can to bring the perpetrators to justice, whoever they are and wherever they may be."" 
Skripal betrayed dozens of Russian agents to British intelligence before his arrest in 2004. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006, and in 2010 was given refuge in Britain after being exchanged for Russian spies.
The attack has been likened in Britain to the assassination of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, a critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who died in London in 2006 after drinking green tea laced with radioactive polonium-210.
A British public inquiry said Litvinenko's murder had probably been approved by Putin and carried out by two Russians, Dmitry Kovtun and Andrei Lugovoy. Lugovoy is an ex-KGB bodyguard who later became a member of parliament.
Both denied responsibility and Russia has refused to extradite them.
Rudd denied that Britain's response after Litvinenko's murder had been too soft, effectively sending a message that such crimes could be carried out with impunity. 
""We are absolutely robust about any crimes committed on these streets in the UK. There is nothing soft about the UK's response to any sort of state activity in this country,"" she told BBC radio.
In Russia, some media took an almost jocular tone.
""Do not choose England as your next country of residence, whether you are a professional traitor to your homeland, or you just hate your country in your free time,"" said Kirill Kleimenov, news anchor on Russia's state-run Channel One, as he introduced an item about the story on the evening news bulletin.

""Something's not right there, maybe it's the climate, but in the past few years there have been a lot of strange occurrences there with a terrible outcome. People hang themselves, fall out of windows, are poisoned, or crash in helicopters in simply industrial quantities.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The wife of an Iranian-Canadian environmental activist who died in prison in Tehran last month was barred from leaving Iran, one of her sons said, in an unexplained move that drew an angry response from Canada.
Raam Emami said in an email to journalists that security forces had not allowed his mother, Maryam Mombeini, to get on a plane to Vancouver with him and his brother on Wednesday night.
Mombeini is the widow of Kavous Seyed-Emami, an environmental activist and sociology professor who was arrested on Jan. 24 and died in prison. Iran's judiciary said Seyed-Emami, 63, had committed suicide.
The family has called for an independent investigation of his death.
Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chrystia Freeland, said in a message posted on Twitter that she was ""outraged"" to learn that Mombeini had been barred from leaving Iran. 
""We demand that, as a Canadian, she be given the freedom to return home,"" she added.
Iranian judiciary officials were not immediately available for comment.
Seyed-Emami was the managing director of the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation, which seeks to protect Iran's rare animals. Iran's judiciary said he had set up the NGO as a cover to collect classified information on Iran's missile program.
Raam Emami said the family decided to leave Iran after being constantly ""harassed"".
""The government raided our home and seized all of our valuables (most importantly deeds to our homes),"" he said. ""We can no longer stand this state of constant terror.""
Raam Emami has previously said that the family was under pressure from authorities not to publicize the case of Seyed-Emami.
""The authorities told our lawyers to tell the brothers 'to shut up or we'll shut them up,' Emami said, adding government agents had told him they were watching him.
Human rights activists have reported that at least six detainees have died in prison in the last two months in Iran. The judiciary has confirmed three deaths in custody but said all three had committed suicide.
President Hassan Rouhani last month appointed a committee to investigate the incidents in prisons.
Shahindokht Molaverdi, Rouhani's special assistant on civil rights and a member of the committee, said on Thursday that Rouhani was ""serious about investigating"" the death of Seyed-Emami and other prisoners.
She said the committee has met families of some deceased prisoners.
Bilateral ties between Iran and Canada worsened in 2003 when an Iranian-Canadian photojournalist, Zahra Kazemi, died in Tehran’s Evin prison while in custody. 
Canada cut all diplomatic ties with Iran in 2012.

1566,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 05:50AM ET</span>",UK to build prison wing in Lagos to transfer Nigerian prisoners,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will build a new wing at Kirikiri Prison in the Nigerian city of Lagos so that it can transfer Nigerian prisoners there, the government in London has announced.
The new 112-bed wing, which will cost 700,000 pounds ($973,000) and be compliant with United Nations standards, will make it easier for Britain to comply with a prisoner transfer agreement it signed with Nigeria in 2014.
Under that deal, eligible prisoners serving criminal sentences in Nigeria and Britain can be returned to complete their sentences in their respective countries. The British government did not indicate how many prisoners might be moved or when the project is likely to be completed.
Nigerian prisons -- many of them built by British colonizers more than 100 years ago -- are severely overcrowded, leading to the spread of diseases. The government in Abuja has said it is developing a strategy to tackle the issue.
Britain's own prison system has been showing signs of severe strain in recent years, with overcrowding, rising suicide rates and a growing problem with drug trafficking and other crimes within jails that were sometimes built in the Victorian era.
Kirikiri is not one of the oldest prisons in Nigeria but it does date back to colonial times.
Last month, the government said the prison in the southern city of Port Harcourt, which was originally designed to hold 800 prisoners, currently has nearly 5,000. It said 3,700 of them had been awaiting trial for more than five years. 
In a written statement to parliament, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said tenders had been placed and a supplier identified to conduct the building work at Kirikiri. He did not name the supplier.
The project will be funded from Britain's Conflict, Stability and Security Fund, which has an annual budget of more than 1 billion pounds and aims to commission projects that can help prevent conflicts and stabilize countries or regions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The second winter storm in a week will continue to dump wet, heavy snow on New England on Thursday, forcing schools to close and leaving hundreds of thousands without power as it promised to slow the morning commute across the region.
A foot (30 cm) of snow and fierce wind gusts of up to 55 miles per hour (88 km/h) were expected from eastern New York through northern Maine on Thursday after the storm slammed the region on Wednesday, the National Weather Service said in several watches and warnings.
Up to 2 feet of snow accumulation was expected in some inland parts of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts and 18 inches was possible in Maine.
Boston public schools along with dozens of schools throughout New England canceled classes on Thursday as local officials and forecasters warned commuters of whiteout conditions and slick roads.
""With snow removal efforts underway, motorists are asked to stay off roads, stay home and stay safe,"" the Boston Police Department said on Twitter.
Amtrak suspended passenger train services between New York City and Boston until at least 10 a.m. local time and canceled dozens of routes on Thursday.
Two dozen flights were already canceled early on Thursday morning after about half of all scheduled flights were canceled at the three major airports serving New York City on Wednesday.
The website said more than 2,100 flights had been delayed and 2,700 canceled, most of them in the Northeast, as of 8 p.m. local time on Wednesday.
The dense snow and strong winds downed trees and power lines, knocking power out for hundreds of thousands in New England and the Mid Atlantic, according to Poweroutage.us, a website that tracks outages.
""4am, no power (no heat), waiting for a text from work to say ""we will be closed today"". Fingers crossed!"" tweeted Jessica Squeglia in Peabody, Massachusetts.
Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy ordered many state workers to head home early on Wednesday afternoon at staggered intervals to avoid traffic snarls on slippery roads.
The governors of New Jersey and Pennsylvania declared states of emergency, giving them access to support from the U.S. government if needed.

Last week's storm brought major coastal flooding to Massachusetts, killed at least nine people and knocked out power to about 2.4 million homes and businesses in the Northeast.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - A suspected U.S. drone strike on a training camp in an isolated part of Afghanistan's eastern province of Kunar on Wednesday killed more than 20 Pakistani Taliban preparing to launch suicide attacks in Pakistan, officials said.
Two Pakistani intelligence officials said the attack, carried out in a village called Saresha Sultan Shah, killed at least two senior figures in the movement, besides someone believed to be a trainer of suicide bombers.
The Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehrik-i Taliban Pakistan or TTP, is separate from the Afghan Taliban and combines a number of groups that fight the government of Pakistan. The U.S. State Department has put it on a list of foreign terrorist organizations.
Last month, a suspected U.S. drone strike on the Pakistani side of the border killed the deputy leader of the TTP, which has been waging a campaign of bombings and other attacks on Pakistani forces.
The Pakistani intelligence officials said Wednesday's drone strike in Kunar, an undeveloped and thickly forested province on the two countries' border, took place during a visit by senior TTP figures prior to sending the militants into Pakistan.
They said it killed Gul Mohammad, a TTP leader in Bajaur Agency on the Afghan border, and Qari Yaseen, whom officials described as a ""master trainer of suicide bombers"". A son of TTP leader Fazlullah Khorasani was also killed, they added.
Sources in the Pakistani Taliban confirmed the strike had killed more than a dozen of their members but said Fazlullah Khorasani, who was visiting the training camp at the time of the attack, had not himself been killed.
A spokesman of the NATO-led Resolute Support mission and U.S. forces in Afghanistan headquarters in the capital, Kabul, did not confirm the report. 
""We were not aware of this report and have no additional information to offer,"" he said in an emailed statement.
Last year, the CIA requested increased authorities to conduct covert drone strikes against militant targets in Afghanistan.
Provincial officials in Kunar confirmed a drone strike had been carried out, but did not say what the target had been.
Afghanistan and Pakistan accuse each other of allowing militant groups to shelter in remote frontier regions to prepare cross-border attacks. U.S. officials have also accused Pakistan of not doing enough to crack down on such groups operating on its side of the border.
Relations between Washington and Islamabad have become increasingly strained over the issue and the United States this year suspended about $2 billion in assistance to Pakistan.

KIEV (Reuters) - Family doctor Dmitriy Rozumiy struggles to bridge the gap between what his patients in rural Ukraine need and what the country's cash-strapped healthcare system can provide.
His clinic in the village of Ivankovichy, 35 kilometers outside Kiev, uses Soviet-era medical equipment and lacks basic supplies. Life expectancy in Ukraine is on average five years shorter than the European average, according to the World Health Organization.
Rozumiy, 51, has worked as a general practitioner since 2014. Before that, he worked as a cancer surgeon but he gave up because budget cuts were causing late diagnoses and leading to lower survival rates.
His current patients are mostly children and pensioners. Many working age adults choose not to be treated because they often cannot afford the medicines that are available.
Recently, Rozumiy said he has seen some improvements since the start of a Western-backed reform drive.
""There's a desperate need,"" he said, expressing a hope for faster change. Patchy implementation of the reform drive has raised questions about Ukraine's ability to modernize after a pro-European uprising in 2013-2014.
Last October, parliament approved a long-delayed overhaul of the health system following international pressure to speed up reform.
""I hope ... this will give us a chance but if this turns out to be yet another bluff, well then we'll lose everything,"" Rozumiy said.
He said recent positive changes include the launch of programs to improve treatment for military veterans and help pensioners gain access to certain medicines.
But times remain tough, forcing Rozumiy to consider halting some home visits as he cannot afford the petrol costs for his car on a salary of around 6000 hryvnias ($230) per month.
His clinic's decrepit central heating system occasionally fails in the middle of winter, prompting parents to keep their children bundled up in snow-suits during consultations.
Ivankovichy is far from unique. Hospitals across the country of 42 million are crumbling, underpayment of medical staff has prompted many to quit and Ukraine's vaccination rate is one of the worst in Europe.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish inventor Peter Madsen denied murdering Swedish journalist Kim Wall aboard his homebuilt submarine in August, telling a court on Thursday he disposed of her body after she died breathing in exhaust fumes.
On the first day of his trial, Madsen, 47, said he had had to dismember the corpse to get it out of the submarine. He intended to dispose of the body parts at sea to restore a ""normal"" condition on board, he said, admitting he was not thinking rationally at the time.
Madsen is accused of murdering and dismembering Wall, a 30-year-old Swedish journalist who was researching a story on the man who was already well known in Denmark for his submarines and his plan to send a human into space in a home-made rocket. 
Wall disappeared after Madsen took her out to sea in his 17-metre (56-ft) submarine in August last year. Later that month, police identified a torso washed ashore in Copenhagen as Wall's. 
He is also accused of ""sexual assault without intercourse, of a particularly dangerous nature"" in relation to the 14 interior and exterior stab wounds investigators found to Wall's genitals, prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen told the court.
Prosecutors said Wall died either by strangulation or having her throat cut. Madsen faces up to life in prison if convicted. 
""I plead not guilty to the voluntary manslaughter of Kim Wall,"" Madsen told the court.
Under the Danish penal code, manslaughter is used to describe the deliberate killing of a person and there is no distinction between manslaughter and murder. 
Madsen, wearing a black t-shirt and jeans, told the court that Wall had died from breathing exhaust gases that had leaked into the submarine due to a technical error, while he was on the deck of the vessel preparing for to submerge.
""When I turn to open the hatch cover, the most terrible minutes of my life begin. I cannot open the hatch, because the engine is sucking air from the cabin,"" he said. 
""Then I hear Kim calling.""
After eventually opening the hatch, he said: ""I crawl down and find Kim Wall lifeless. I kneel beside her and pat her on the cheeks.""
He has previously admitted to dismembering her body and dumping the body parts at sea. 
Prosecutor Buch-Jepsen said Madsen had searched the internet for ""beheading girl"" just hours before the trip, and had videos of real killings of women on his computer.
Investigators had found Madsen's semen on the clothes he was wearing during the trip, Buch-Jepsen said. Madsen denied in court having had any sexual relations with Wall.

The trial is scheduled over twelve court hearings, with a verdict expected on April 25.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Thursday that African countries should be careful not to forfeit their sovereignty when they accept loans from China, the continent's biggest trading partner.
Tillerson is using his first diplomatic trip to the continent to bolster security alliances on a continent increasingly turning to Beijing for aid and trade. [L5N1QP17F] 
He may also seek to smooth relations after U.S. President Trump reportedly dismissed some African nations as ""shithole countries"" in January. Trump later denied making the comment. 
""We are not in any way attempting to keep Chinese dollars from Africa,"" Tillerson told a news conference in the Ethiopian capital. ""It is important that African countries carefully consider the terms of those agreements and not forfeit their sovereignty.""
The United States is the leading aid donor to Africa but China surpassed it as a trade partner in 2009. Beijing has pumped billions into infrastructure projects, though critics say the use of Chinese firms and labor undermines their value.
Tillerson said Chinese investments ""do not bring significant job creation locally"" and criticized how Beijing structures loans to African government. 
If a government accepts a Chinese loan and ""gets into trouble"", he said, it can ""lose control of its own infrastructure or its own resources through default."" He did not give examples.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, visiting Zimbabwe on Thursday, told reporters it was inappropriate for Tillerson to criticize China's relationship with African countries.
""It was not appropriate to criticize the relations of his hosts -- when he was a guest there -- with another country,"" he said. Many African governments enjoy close ties with both Washington and Beijing. 
Kenya, for example, inaugurated a $3.2 billion railway funded by China last year. For the last three years, Kenya has received more than $100 million annually in U.S. security assistance.
Asked about Tillerson's criticism of China's approach on the continent, Kenya's foreign affairs minister Monica Juma said: ""This country is engaging with partners from across the world driven by our own interests and for our own value.""
""OPAQUE CONTRACTS""
Tillerson arrived in Ethiopia, Africa's second most populous nation, on Wednesday and visited the African Union headquarters on Thursday. The complex was funded and built by China and is seen as a symbol of Beijing's thrust for influence and access to the continent's natural resources.
Ethiopia is home to some of Beijing's biggest investments, from a railway to Djibouti that opened last year to factories and industrial parks. 
Earlier this week, Tillerson criticized ""China's approach"" to Africa which he said encouraged dependency through ""opaque contracts"" and ""predatory loan practices"". 
Ethiopia's prime minister resigned suddenly last month and a state of emergency was imposed but protests in the restive Oromia region have continued. 
Tillerson said after meeting his Ethiopian counterpart Workneh Gebeyehu that the answer to political turmoil in Ethiopia was greater freedoms and said state of emergency should be lifted as quickly as possible.
Tillerson reiterated previous calls for African states to cut ties with North Korea.
North Korea has more than a dozen embassies on the continent. The Trump administration has said that Pyongyang earns hard currency from arms deals with African government and the trafficking of wildlife parts from Africa.
Tillerson is due to fly to Djibouti, host to military bases owned by the U.S., China, Japan, France, and Italy. 
He will then visit Kenya, a key U.S. ally in the fight against al Shabaab Islamist militants in Somalia, before traveling to Chad and Nigeria, which are also battling to contain Islamist insurgents. 
Analysts say Trump has focused mainly on security concerns in Africa at a time when China, Turkey and other nations are ramping up diplomatic and business links. 

""When you look at the set of countries that are being visited I think it kind of reinforces the perception that security, indeed, is the overwhelming focus,"" said Brahima Coulibaly, the director of the Africa Growth Initiative at Brookings Institution.

Speaking on Wednesday on the sidelines of China's annual meeting of parliament, the party boss of the remote northwestern province of Qinghai, birthplace of the Dalai Lama, said Tibetans who lived there had been saying they view Xi as a deity.
Wang Guosheng said the province had been following Mao Zedong's advice about inspiring the masses to love the party and its leader, distributing ""images of the leader"" to people in poverty-stricken areas being moved into new homes. 
He did not specify if these were images of Mao or Xi.
""The ordinary people in the herder areas say, only General Secretary Xi is a living Bodhisattva. This is a really vivid thing to say,"" Wang said.
Bodhisattvas are individuals who carry out compassionate acts to achieve enlightenment. Tibetan Buddhists consider their exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, to be an incarnation of Avalokitesvara, a Bodhisattva of compassion.
Xi, who will be positioned to remain in office indefinitely when China's largely rubber-stamp parliament approves the removal of presidential term limits on Sunday, is considered China's most powerful leader since Mao.
Qinghai has a large Tibetan population, many of them yak herders, whom China has controversially been moving into permanent homes rather than allowing them to continue their traditional nomadic way of life.
Wang's comments were reported late on Wednesday by the state-run Beijing News on its WeChat account.
Despite being the ancestral home of the Dalai Lama, Qinghai is generally less tense than what China refers to as the Tibet Autonomous Region, and normally has no travel restrictions for foreigners.
Tibetan rights groups and exiles regularly criticize the government for not respecting the religious rights and traditions of Tibetans, and say China has trampled upon their culture. 

China denies the accusations, saying its rule has brought development to once poverty-struck areas.

RAWANGA CAMP, Iraq (Reuters) - While children who have been through war typically draw devastating pictures of the violence they have suffered, few show themselves as the perpetrators.
The suicide belts, car bombs and other explosives sketched again and again by a 14-year-old boy newly arrived at this camp in northern Iraq are the ones he built himself: used by Islamic State militants against civilians and troops in Iraq and Syria.
One image depicted him killing a man with a spray of bullets, something he said he did during three years as a child fighter forcibly conscripted by Islamic State.
Kidnapped from his Yazidi homeland in northern Iraq, he said he got used to the sound of bombs falling on Islamic State's de facto capital, Raqqa, in Syria, as security forces closed in last year.
""Here's where I got shot fighting the SDF,"" said the boy, not named to protect him from retribution, referring to the U.S.-backed rebel Syrian Defense Forces and pointing out a bullet wound on his shin.
Giving him time to draw and talk about his experience is part of a treatment program to help him move on and protect both him and others from lasting damage.
Hundreds of children are estimated to have been used as fighters by Islamic State, including boys who joined with their families or were given up by them and the offspring of foreign fighters groomed from birth to perpetuate its ideology.
Experts have warned that indoctrinated children, who began escaping the clutches of Islamic State as its territory fractured last year, could pose an ongoing threat to security, both regionally and in the West, if they are not rehabilitated.
Treating Yazidi children, who were separated from their families and in many cases orphaned, holds particular challenges.
PERSECUTED TWICE
There is little in the way of specialized care for them in Iraq, where the minimum age of criminal responsibility is nine. The government has detained and prosecuted dozens of children for their suspected IS affiliation, according to a recent report by New York-based Human Rights Watch.
Naif Jardo Qassim, a psychotherapist treating children at Rawanga refugee camp near Dohuk emphasized that they are ""victims and not criminals,"" and should be treated as such.
Highlighting the scale of the task, Yazidi teacher Hoshyar Khodeida Suleiman recounts the story of one of his students, a young boy reunited with his family in the autumn.
A few days later, the boy's father woke up in the middle of the night to find his son wielding a knife to his throat, confused about whether he should kill his parents or himself.
""He was screaming that they were infidels and that he would rather die than be one of them,"" Suleiman said.
When the militants overran Yazidi towns and villages in 2014, it killed or enslaved more than 9,000 adults and children in what the United Nations has called a genocidal campaign against a religious minority labeled heretic by Islamic State.
It sold girls and women into slavery, marrying some off to fighters, and trained many boys to join the ranks of what it called the Cubs of the Caliphate, posting videos of them committing atrocities in the name of its self-declared state.
Most of the children returned, not home, but to displacement camps in northern Iraq, where they live with relatives – their parents either missing or killed by the militants.
""Everything changed while they were gone,"" said Qassim. ""That's if they even remember anything from their lives before.""
Adding to that instability is the weight of the traumas they have endured.
""These children have seen their families killed, or were kidnapped, beaten and brainwashed,"" he said. ""In some cases, they witnessed executions, were forced to kill or were raped, multiple times, for years.""
Qassim works for Yahad In-Unum, one of a handful of international NGOs which has set up a children’s center in the camp, where children can receive psychological treatment, ranging from talk to art therapy.
They also come to play, said Qassim, ""and remember how to be children again"".
REMEMBERING
Qassim’s six-month-old center is currently treating 123 children, a mix of girls and boys all under the age of 18, recently returned from Islamic State-held territory.
""When they first come back from captivity, the children can often be aggressive, violent, confused and angry,"" he said, adding that many of the children were forced to forget their native Kurdish. ""That quickly dissolves into anxiety and deep depression, as the trauma begins to settle in.""
The center devises a treatment program for each child, which involves both individual and group therapy sessions.
""We slowly work to undo the years of brainwashing they were subjected to,"" said Qassim. ""We want them to forget the last few years and start again.""
He said all the children he has treated were successfully ""de-indoctrinated"", adding, ""no child is beyond saving"".
The relative novelty of so-called deradicalization programs means opinion is divided over their effectiveness; Laila Ali, spokesperson for UNICEF in Iraq which supports such services, says rehabilitation is ""absolutely possible"".
Some children are harder to reach than others, particularly those who have forgotten life before IS.
One 10-year-old boy was smuggled out of Syria just three and a half weeks ago and has since been living with his uncle in the camp. Shy at first, he became animated when describing his ""accomplishments"" during his fighter training in Deir Ezzor, Syria and said he is not sure his current life is better.
Qassim says he exhibits confusion about whether he should denounce Islamic State's teachings. He and other children sneak off to pray in the toilets, unconvinced they will not get in trouble with Islamic State for shirking religious obligations.
Qassim says he is hopeful he will be back to normal soon.
Some face new humiliations on their return. ""I had to move in with my relatives because my parents said they would never accept me back because of what I did,"" said one former fighter, now aged 15.
Qassim is the only psychotherapist at his center and the work takes its toll. ""It's very difficult to hear children tell you these stories - of rape, of combat, of killings... In my life, I'd never heard such horrors.""
With little in the way of funds or a roadmap, some community members have pitched in to help in their own ways.
Suleiman aims to rehabilitate Yazidi children at Sharya refugee camp near Dohuk by ""reconnecting them with their Yazidi faith"", with an emphasis on ""humanity and human decency"".
On a rainy afternoon in late February, they came to class in traditional clothes he had given them: white dresses and scarves with black and gold headbands for the girls; trousers, matching waistcoat and red and white keffiyeh scarf for the boys.
""It's a simple thing,"" he said. ""But the clothes are a reminder of who they are and where they come from.""

The Cayman Islands-flagged Equanimity was impounded by Indonesia amid a multi-billion dollar corruption investigation launched by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and tied to 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
Indonesian police and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were ""preparing paperwork"" for a hand over of the ship, said Daniel Silitonga, deputy director of economic and special crimes at Indonesia's criminal investigation bureau. 
Silitonga said authorities had taken the vessel's logbook but a search had not found any money on board.
Police have also questioned the captain and crew but had found no link to an investigation into money laundering, said Agung Setya, director of economic and special crimes at Indonesia's criminal investigation bureau.
1MDB is at the center of money-laundering probes in at least six countries, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore.
A total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates, according to civil lawsuits filed by the DOJ.
Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up 1MDB in 2009 and previously served as chairman of its advisory board. He and the fund have denied any wrongdoing.
Among assets sought under the DOJ investigation is Equanimity, a $250 million yacht bought by Malaysian financier Jho Low, named as a key figure in the U.S. lawsuits which say he used proceeds diverted from 1MDB to buy it.
Low's whereabouts are unknown and his Hong Kong company has not responded to requests for comment.
A spokesperson for Low was quoted in Malaysian media last week as saying it was ""disappointing that, rather than reflecting on the deeply flawed and politically motivated allegations, the DOJ is continuing with its pattern of global over reach - all based on entirely unsupported claims of wrongdoing"".
Malaysian Inspector-General of Police Mohamad Fuzi Harun said in a statement that the seizure of Equanimity in Indonesia was a U.S. court civil forfeiture action against Low and not against 1MDB.  

""The Royal Malaysian Police has also not received any information from Indonesian authorities or the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding the seizure of the Equanimity in Indonesian waters on Feb 28. The RMP has also not been contacted by any other party to assist in the investigation regarding the yacht.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese opposition parties turned up the heat on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday over a cronyism scandal that threatens to erode his influence, after documents released by a ministry failed to banish suspicion that some had been doctored. 
Allegations that a school operator with ties to Abe's wife, Akie, got a sweetheart deal on land for a school in the city of Osaka dented the premier's popularity last year.
The former head of the school operator and his wife were arrested in July on suspicion of illegally receiving subsidies.
Abe, in his sixth year in office and eyeing a three-year extension from September, had seemed to put the matter behind him with a big election win for the ruling bloc in October.
Last week, however, the Asahi newspaper reported that some documents about the land sale may have been doctored. That followed revelations the finance ministry had retained documents that officials had said no longer existed.
Under pressure from ruling party heavyweights along with the opposition, the ministry on Thursday released to parliament hundreds of pages of what it said were copies of the original documents, but opposition lawmakers said their doubts remained.
""This is not simply a matter of whether documents were altered or not. It is a matter that destroys the very foundation of politics,"" said Renho, an upper house lawmaker from the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, who goes by one name.
""If remarks in parliament and documents submitted by the government are fraudulent, we cannot debate anything,"" Renho told fellow lawmakers.
Abe's ruling bloc has big majorities in both houses of parliament, so his grip on power appears unlikely to be at risk. But falling support could complicate his bid for a third three-year term as Liberal Democratic Party leader in a September party vote. 
Re-election would put him on track to become Japan's longest-serving premier.
Abe has denied that he or his wife did favors for the former head of the school operator Moritomo Gakuen, Yasunori Kagoike.
At a meeting on Thursday of the upper house budget committee - boycotted by most opposition lawmakers - Abe said the finance ministry should make ""make maximum efforts"" to explain the situation soon, comments echoed by Finance Minister Taro Aso.
Aso, a close Abe ally, could end up in the hot seat if it turns out that officials of his ministry altered approved documents.
""If the Asahi report is true ... it would become a matter of Aso's responsibility,"" said Nihon University political science professor Tomoaki Iwai. 

""It is hard to see where this will end.""

1579,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 02:22PM ET</span>",Syrian government forces poised to slice eastern Ghouta in two: commander,"By Laila Bassam and Suleiman Al-Khalidi
BEIRUT/AMMAN (Reuters) - Syria's army is poised to slice rebel-held eastern Ghouta in two as forces advancing from the east link up with troops at its western edge, a pro-Damascus commander said on Thursday.
The government, backed in the war by Russia and Iran, is seeking to crush the last major rebel enclave near the capital in a ferocious campaign that the aid agency Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF) says has killed more than 1,000 people. 
Rebels, who accuse the government of ""scorched earth"" tactics, said they were deploying more guerrilla-style ambushes in lost territory, trying to stop further advances. 
""We came because of the intensity of the bombing,"" said Abu Mohammed, a 32-year-old farmer who had left his cows, sheep and farm equipment to join thousands of others fleeing to Douma, further into the rebel enclave. 
""It was a miracle that we made it here,"" he said, speaking of the heavy air strikes. As for his former home town of Beit Sawa: ""It was totally destroyed. Burnt,"" he said. 
Defeat in eastern Ghouta would mark the worst setback for rebels since the opposition was driven from eastern Aleppo in late 2016 after a similar campaign of siege, bombing and ground assaults.
MSF said on Thursday the offensive had killed 1,005 people and injured at least 4,829. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group in Britain, says 915 civilians have died in the last 18 days, including 91 on Wednesday. 
A U.N. official said fighting had reportedly driven the everyone in the towns of Mesraba, Hammouriyeh and Mudeira to seek refuge elsewhere in the rapidly shrinking pocket. They had an estimated population of about 50,000 in December, the official said. 
The pro-Damascus commander, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed a report by the Observatory late on Wednesday that the enclave had effectively been sliced in two.
But Wael Alwan, the Istanbul-based spokesman for Failaq al-Rahman, one of the main rebel groups in eastern Ghouta, denied that the territory had been cut in half. ""No,"" he said in a text message when asked if the report was correct. 
Another rebel spokesman, Hamza Birqadar of the Jaish al-Islam group, said in a tweet on Thursday that insurgents had regained some positions in a counter-attack. 
The Observatory reported heavy fighting on several fronts. A military media unit run by the government's ally Hezbollah also reported that the army had taken the village of Hosh al-Ashari and a military base near Aftaris, both in the southern part of the enclave. 
CONVOY
In northern Syria, rebels began to bombard two government-held villages besieged by insurgent forces, killing two children, the Observatory reported.
Plans to send an aid convoy to Ghouta on Thursday were postponed, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the United Nations said.
""Convoys need to come in with food and supplies - and the last convoy was only half unloaded,"" Henrietta Fore, executive director of the U.N. children's agency UNICEF, told Reuters.
The United Nations says 400,000 people are trapped in the towns and villages of eastern Ghouta. They have been under government siege for years and were already short of food and medicine before the assault. 
""We are dying of hunger and our children are dying of hunger. Have pity on us,"" said a woman reached in Douma by a voice messaging service, who identified herself as Um Mahmoud. 
Russia, President Bashar al-Assad's most powerful ally, has offered rebels safe passage out with their families and personal weapons. The proposal echoes previous agreements under which insurgents, in the face of military defeat, were permitted to withdraw to opposition-held areas along the Turkish border. 
Syrian state news agency SANA reported that a second safe route out of eastern Ghouta, along with one near Douma, had been opened in the southern part of the enclave. 
Russia's defense ministry said on Wednesday some rebels wanted to accept the proposal to evacuate. So far rebels have dismissed it in public and vowed to fight on.
BATTLES RAGING
Syria's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Hussam Aala, told the U.N. Human Rights Council on Thursday the assault targeted ""terrorist organisations in accordance with international humanitarian law"".
Moscow and Damascus say the Ghouta campaign is necessary to halt deadly rebel shelling of the capital. 
Rescue workers and opposition activists in eastern Ghouta have accused the government of using chlorine gas during the campaign.
The government firmly denies this. Damascus and Moscow have accused rebels of planning to orchestrate poison gas attacks in order to draw blame onto the Syrian government.
A Syria-focused medical aid group said there were reports from doctors of a chlorine attack on Wednesday evening. Local rescue workers said gas had affected 50 people. 
Social media activists shared videos and photos, which Reuters could not verify, of people with signs of breathing difficulties.
The opposition-run rescue service said two of its rescuers were killed when their ambulance was hit last night, adding its teams were hampered from reaching many victims under rubble. 
The narrow point linking rebel territory in north and south parts of eastern Ghouta is all within the range of government fire and impossible for insurgents to cross, meaning the enclave has in military terms been bisected, the commander said. 
A rebel fighter with Jaish al-Islam, one of the main factions in eastern Ghouta, said intense fighting was under way. 

""Nothing is secure and battles are raging and it's difficult to predict what will happen,"" the fighter, who gave his name as Abu Ahmad al-Doumani, said in a text message to Reuters.

The 82-year-old Ozawa, a former conductor at the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Vienna State Opera, had suffered from esophageal cancer, multiple bouts of pneumonia and back problems severe enough to require surgery in the past eight years, but recovered and went back to conducting.
Ozawa was diagnosed with aortic valve stenosis and will undergo treatment and rehabilitation for about a month at a Tokyo hospital, his office said.
The condition, in which the heart's aortic valve narrows, blocking blood flow to the aorta and then the rest of the body, is often treated by surgery to repair or replace the valve. No details about treatment were given.
Known for throwing his whole body into conducting, Ozawa has drawn mixed reviews from critics for his dramatic style, once injuring himself during a concert.

But his bushy hair and smile charmed audiences, especially in the United States, where his tenure as music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra spanned nearly three decades and made him a household name.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines' tax bureau filed a criminal complaint on Thursday accusing news site Rappler and two executives of evading 133.8 million pesos ($2.6 million) in tax, the latest move against a network whose reporting has irritated the government.
The case comes eight weeks after the Securities and Exchange Commission rescinded Rappler's operating license for violating foreign ownership rules.
Rappler continues to operate pending an appeal and says it has done nothing wrong and is being punished on multiple levels for scrutinizing the government. It says the complaint is another case of ""harassment"", having already received seven complaints from state agencies in recent weeks.
The Bureau of Internal Revenue said Rappler had profited from the sale of Philippine Depositary Receipts (PDR) to foreigners in 2015 and should pay income and value added tax.
An American investor in Rappler who had bought PDRs has agreed to donate its interests to Rappler's managers, which it said would give the government no legal grounds to stifle its operations.
The alleged tax liability comprised of 91.3 million pesos in income tax and 42.5 million pesos in VAT. Also subject of the complaint was Rappler chief Maria Ressa and its treasurer, James Bitanga.
Rappler said BIR agents went to its office this week with a letter from its tax evasion unit that was ""scant with details"". Normal procedure provides respondents with 30 days to reply, it said.
""This is clear intimidation and harassment. The government is wasting its energy and resources in an attempt to silence reporting that do not please the administration,"" Ressa said.
Urging the BIR to check its own records, she said Rappler had been paying its taxes accurately, promptly and diligently.
President Rodrigo Duterte's spokesman, Harry Roque, asked to comment on the case, said: ""If there really is unpaid tax, they should be held accountable.""
The government has repeatedly denied it is going after Rappler or trying to stifle freedom of the press.
Rappler has challenged Duterte frequently, questioning the accuracy of his public statements and scrutinizing his war on drugs and his foreign policy moves.
It has done a series of stories about ties between Duterte's office and bloggers who have influenced online hate campaigns against his opponents and journalists.

1582,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 01:30AM ET</span>","Taiwan's allies ditching Taipei an 'irresistible trend', China says","BEIJING (Reuters) - It is in the best interests of Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies to recognize an ""irresistible trend"" and ditch Taipei in favor of ties with Beijing, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Thursday.
Self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its own, has formal relations with only 20 countries, many of them poor nations in Central America and the Pacific. China says Taiwan is simply a wayward province with no right to state-to-state ties.
China and Taiwan have tried to poach each other's allies over the years, often dangling generous aid packages in front of developing nations, although Taipei struggles to compete with an increasingly powerful China.
Panama severed its long-standing relationship with Taiwan last year in a major diplomatic victory for China.
The Vatican is likely next on the list, as the Holy See and China edge closer to an accord on the appointment of bishops.
Wang said there was only one China and Taiwan was an inalienable part of it, something he said was already the long-standing consensus of the international community.
""Upholding the 'one China' principle and not having official contacts with Taiwan has already become one of the international norms for countries to follow,"" he said on the sidelines of the annual meeting of parliament in Beijing. 
""Establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, the only legal representative of the entire Chinese people, and having normal cooperation is obviously the correct choice that conforms to the times,"" Wang said.
He said it was ""the general and irresistible trend"" and was in the long-term interests of those countries.
China's hostility towards Taiwan has risen since the election of President Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party in 2016.

It suspects Tsai wants to push for formal independence, which would cross a red line for Communist Party leaders in Beijing, although Tsai has said she wants to maintain the status quo and is committed to ensuring peace.

1583,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>",Mexican leftist leads by 13.6 point in presidency race: opinion poll,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador leads by 13.6 percentage points in the run-up to Mexico's July 1 presidential election and has an even bigger advantage over the ruling party candidate, a voter survey by polling firm Ipsos showed on Thursday. 
The opinion poll seen by Reuters showed two-time runner-up Lopez Obrador, a former mayor of Mexico City, garnering 36.3 percent support in the election.
Running second on 22.7 percent was Ricardo Anaya, a onetime leader of the center-right National Action Party (PAN), who fronts the challenge of a right-left coalition.
Back in third, on 15.1 percent, was former finance minister Jose Antonio Meade, the candidate of President Enrique Pena Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
The Ipsos survey is the latest of several opinion polls to show Lopez Obrador in a strong position ahead of the start of formal campaigning on March 30. He finished second in 2006 and 2012.
The 64-year-old founder of the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party has capitalized on disaffection with the PRI over a slew of political corruption scandals, increasing gang violence and sluggish economic growth.
Meade, who is not formally affiliated to any party, has so far struggled to gain traction in a race being run in the shadow of strained relations between his government and U.S. President Donald Trump, who has frequently criticized Mexico.
The poll was the first conducted by Ipsos since the three main contenders were formally chosen as candidates last month.
It had a margin of error of 2.53 percentage points and consisted of 1,500 face-to-face interviews carried out nationwide between Feb. 24 and March 3, Ipsos said.
The poll also suggested that many voters may still be up for grabs, with more than 32 percent of the respondents surveyed either rejecting all contenders, or giving no answer.
In addition, independent hopeful and former first lady Margarita Zavala had around 2.8 percent support, with two other independents polling a combined 1.5 percent between them.
Trump has riled Mexicans by insisting the country will pay for a border wall he wants built to keep out illegal immigrants, and by threatening to dump the North American Free Trade Agreement, a cornerstone of Mexico's business model.

A separate survey by polling firm Parametria published on Wednesday showed Lopez Obrador widening his lead over Anaya to 14 points, with Meade also losing ground.

The collision on Aug. 21, which killed 10 sailors and was one of a handful of incidents in the Asia Pacific region involving U.S. Navy warships, raised questions about Navy training and led to the removal of a number of officers.
""The collision between the USS John S McCain (JSM) and Alnic MC (AM) as they were transiting through the Singapore Strait happened because of a sudden turn to Port by JSM, which caused it to head into the path of AM,"" the report said. 
The sudden turn was due to ""a series of missteps"" that took place at the control of the John S. McCain that unintentionally increased the rate of the vessel's turn, the report by the Transport Safety Investigation Bureau said.
The agency is the air and marine accident investigative arm of the Singapore government. It said its report ""should not be used to assign blame or determine liability"".
The John S McCain's sister ship, guided missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald, almost sank off the coast of Japan in June last year after colliding with a Philippine container ship. The bodies of seven U.S. sailors were recovered after that incident.
The U.S. Navy subsequently announced a series of systemic reforms aimed at restoring basic naval skills and alertness at sea after a review of deadly ship collisions in the Asia-Pacific showed sailors were under-trained and over-worked.

KANDY, Sri Lanka (Reuters) - A curfew in the Sri Lankan town of Kandy will be temporarily lifted on Thursday, authorities said, following days of violence against members of the minority Muslim community by Buddhists.
Buddhist mobs have attacked mosques and Muslim businesses in the central highland town since an altercation between members of the two communities over the weekend, prompting President Maithripala Sirisena to declare a state of emergency.
The Kandy area was quiet on Wednesday night and early on Thursday, the military said. 
""The situation is improving and there have been no major incidents of violence reported in the last 12 hours,"" said Major General Rukman Dias, the army commander in the area.
Dias said the curfew was likely to be re-imposed in Kandy in the evening.
Communal tensions in Sri Lanka have grown in the past year with some hardline Buddhist groups accusing Muslims of forcing conversions to Islam and vandalizing Buddhist archaeological sites. Muslim groups deny the allegations.
On Wednesday, a grenade blast killed one person and injured three in the area, despite the government's declaration of emergency rule and moves to block social messaging networks in an effort to halt inflammatory speech.
The government said on Wednesday Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Viber and WhatsApp would be blocked across Sri Lanka for three days. 
Muslims make up about 9 percent of Sri Lanka’s 21 million people. Buddhists make up about 70 percent and ethnic Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, about 13 percent.
Some Buddhist nationalists have protested against the presence in Sri Lanka of Muslim Rohingya asylum-seekers from mostly Buddhist Myanmar, where Buddhist nationalism has also been on the rise. 

Sri Lanka was for decades plagued by war between government forces and Tamil separatists. The government defeated the rebels in 2009.

MANILA (Reuters) - A U.N. special rapporteur, a former Philippine lawmaker and four former Catholic priests are among more than 600 alleged communist guerrillas the Philippines wants declared ""terrorists"", according to a government petition filed in court.
The justice ministry last month announced it wanted a Manila court to declare the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, the New People's Army (NPA), ""terrorist"" organizations, but made no mention of individuals it would also target.
The petition, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, suggests President Rodrigo Duterte is following through on his threats to destroy a movement that he now regards as duplicitous.
Within weeks of taking office in July 2016, he freed some communist leaders and put leftists in his cabinet, to show his commitment to finding a permanent solution to a five-decade conflict. 
But he abandoned the process in November after what he said were repeated attacks by the NPA while talks were going on.
The petition said the rebels were ""using acts of terror"" to sow fear and panic to overthrow the government.
Duterte has been venting his fury at the Maoists almost on a daily basis and considers them as much of a security threat as a plethora of domestic Islamist militant groups that have pledged allegiance to Islamic State.
By declaring the groups and individuals terrorists, the government would be able to monitor them closer, track finances and restrict their access to resources, among other things. 
The petition included Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, appointed in 2014 as U.N. special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, who was listed as a senior member of the Maoist rebel group. 
Tauli-Corpuz declined to comment on the petition until she had seen it.
Four former Catholic priests were also named in the case, including Frank Fernandez, whom the government said was an NPA leader in the central Philippines. There was no immediate comment from Fernandez.
The petition included 18 top leaders of the communist party as central committee members, including founder Jose Maria Sison and peace negotiator Luis Jalandoni, both based in The Netherlands for three decades.
Sison was a mentor of Duterte when he was at university. They are now bitter rivals, with seemingly no limit on the ferocity of their rebukes of each other.
More than 40,000 people have been killed in the Maoist rebellion. Negotiations have been on and off since being brokered by Norway in 1986.
Former congressman Satur Ocampo, who has a pending criminal case for his involvement in the murder of suspected military spies in the communist movements in the 1980s, was also on the list.
Ocampo told Reuters he would challenge any ""terrorist"" label.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea vowed on Thursday to strengthen laws against sexual assault and implement measures to reduce harassment as the #MeToo campaign sweeps the country and sparks calls for meaningful action to tackle sexual abuse.
Allegations of sexual assault against a rising star in the ruling Democratic Party, leveled by an aide in a dramatic television interview earlier this week marked a new high for the #MeToo movement in South Korea. 
An Hee-jung, who had been seen as a future candidate for the presidency, quit his post as a provincial governor and announced his retirement from politics having taken responsibility in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post for actions which police are now investigating.
His is the latest and most high profile in a lengthening list of scandals involving politicians and prominent figures from the country's religious community, and entertainment and literary worlds.
""We all had a big shock, and there's a higher consciousness now that women cannot experience such terrible things anymore,"" Chung Hyun-back, Minister of Gender Equality and Family Chung Hyun-back told a press conference on International Women's Day.
Chung credited the #MeToo campaign against sexual assault and harassment for bringing the issue to the surface in a South Korea's male-dominated society.
""The #MeToo movement is an event where boiling rage has finally erupted against gender-biased power relations and gender inequality, which have been a long, deep-rooted evil of our society,"" the minister said.
In response to mounting public outrage, the government said it plans to extend the statute of limitations for power-based sexual abuse cases, and the labor ministry would set up a process for victims to anonymously report sexual harassment at their workplaces.
The government was also considering toughening criminal punishment for employers found negligent in addressing sexual misdeeds, the ministry of gender equality said in a statement.

""We are focusing on sexual harassment and violence based on power relations,"" Chung said.

Flight MH370, carrying 239 people onboard, became one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries when it disappeared on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014.
Malaysia agreed in January to pay U.S. firm Ocean Infinity up to $70 million if it found the plane during an offshore search effort that is underway and expected to end in June. 
The decision to engage the firm came after Australia, China and Malaysia ended a fruitless A$200-million ($159.38 million) search across a 120,000 square-kilometer (46,332 square miles) area in the Indian Ocean last year, despite investigators calling for the target area to be extended 25,000 square kilometers (9653 square miles) north.
The release of a full report into MH370's disappearance has been suspended pending the outcome of the new search, as any new evidence uncovered is ""likely to significantly affect the investigation"", Malaysian investigators said in their annual interim statement sent to families of those aboard the plane. 
""In the event that the aircraft is found, the team will conduct further investigation,"" said the statement seen by Reuters and due to be released publicly later on Thursday.
""If the aircraft is not found and a decision is made to discontinue the search, the team will resume the completion of the report and release it in the months ahead.""
Several pieces of aircraft debris have been found on Indian Ocean islands and along Africa's east coast, and efforts to retrieve more are ongoing.
Three wing fragments were confirmed as coming from the missing plane, while other pieces, including some cabin interior items, were determined to be ""almost certain"" from MH370, the investigators said.
Malaysian officials are working with Australian authorities on plans to recover the Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 777's wreckage or its flight recorders, in the event the aircraft is found. 
Prime Minister Najib Razak reiterated the country's commitment to finding the plane.
""We are pushing the global aviation community to take measures to make our skies safer,"" he said on his official Twitter account on Thursday. 

The Seabed Constructor vessel has covered 16,000 square kilometers (6178 square miles) so far but has yet to identify any significant findings, Ocean Infinity said in its weekly search update on Tuesday.

MACAU (Reuters) - Macau has finished drafting a proposed new law barring foreign judges from hearing national security and defense cases, an unprecedented move that has heightened concerns over Beijing's grip over the gambling hub.
The proposed draft law, announced in February by Sonia Chan, the enclave's mainland-China born justice secretary, has been completed, Macau's Legal Affairs Bureau said in an email to Reuters.
A spokesman said the amendments were needed out of ""consideration of major interests such as safeguarding the sovereignty, security and territorial integrity of the country"".
Chan said in February that the amendments would help speed up trial proceedings.
She added that such cases should be exclusive to local judges, as they might involve confidential information about the nation and national defense. 
The draft law is part of suggested amendments to Macau's Judicial Framework Law that was implemented in 1999 when the former Portuguese colony reverted to Chinese rule.
The government will submit the relevant legal proposals to the Legislative Council after internal procedures are completed, the spokesman added, without giving a timeframe.
Some Portuguese lawyers in Macau expressed alarm that the proposal violates Macau's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, and weakens judicial independence in the city, which is home to international gambling companies including Sands China and MGM China.
""This is totally ridiculous and a very dangerous step,"" said a legal source who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter. ""It is a real attempt on the autonomy of the judicial system.""
While there haven't been many cases in Macau in recent years involving national defense or security, some said the proposal could be part of a broader move to phase out Portuguese-speaking legal practitioners from Macau.
10 of the territory's 49 magistrates now hold foreign citizenship, mostly from Portugal.
The head of Macau's Lawyers Association, Jorge Neto Valente, called it ""a bad solution to create a special body of judges for the trial of a specific type of crime,"" according to TDM, Macau's public broadcaster. 
Macau, like the neighboring financial hub of Hong Kong, is governed under a ""one country, two systems"" framework which allows for certain liberties not permitted on the mainland, such as a free press and an independent judiciary.
Both places allow foreign judges to rule in their judicial systems as part of the Basic Law.
There have been growing fears, however, that autonomy in Macau is being corroded at a faster pace than in the former British colony, where there is deeper opposition to Beijing's rule.
More than half of Macau's population of 650,000 immigrated from China in recent decades, which has helped foster a stronger affinity for the mainland than in Hong Kong, where most of the population was born locally.
A liberal lawmaker and government critic, Sulu Sou, is now facing charges of aggravated disobedience during a protest against Macau's leader, Fernando Chui.

Pedro Cortes, a senior partner with the law firm Rato, Ling, Lei & Cortes in Macau, said the proposal could get passed this year in the predominantly pro-establishment Legislative Assembly. ""It is going to be easy to pass this type of legislation, whatever is the final version proposed,"" he said.

PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill flew over the worst-hit areas on Wednesday after a magnitude 6.7 aftershock struck the mountainous region already reeling from a 7.5 quake on Feb. 26.
""There will be no quick fix. The damage from this disaster will take months and years to be repaired,"" O'Neill said in Tari, the capital of Hela province.
Australia and New Zealand sent more helicopters and planes to help deliver food, water and medicine to the remote region, where the government and aid agencies have been scrambling to reach villages stranded by landslides and collapsed roads.
""Tragically, the Highlands Earthquake has already claimed the lives of an estimated more than 100 Papua New Guineans, with many more still missing and thousands of people injured,"" O'Neill said in comments published by his office.
The Feb. 26 quake forced oil giant ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Corp to shut all its gas facilities in the country, which it expects will be down for around eight weeks while it carries out inspections and repairs.
Exxon's PNG LNG plant, which exports more than 8 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas a year, is the nation's biggest export earner.
The company has said its facilities in the highlands, where it produces and processes gas, and the 700-km (435-mile) pipeline that snakes through the jungle to the coast to feed the LNG plant all stood up well to the earthquake.
""It has essentially come out unscathed,"" ExxonMobil senior vice president Neil Chapman told analysts in New York on Wednesday.
He said the main challenge to restoring operations was moving people back into the quake-hit area and fixing their living quarters.
""It's tough to get people in and out in the highlands right now. Accommodation is a challenge. Infrastructure is a challenge,"" Chapman said.
The eight-week estimate for restarting PNG LNG was preliminary, he said. ""It could be shorter than that.""
ExxonMobil's PNG LNG partner Oil Search has been heavily involved in relief efforts while also trying to inspect and repair its oil and gas facilities in the highlands.
""The integrity of facilities have been maintained and there has been no leakage from any of the facilities,"" Oil Search Managing Director Peter Botten told Reuters by phone from Port Moresby.
He played down talk of looting and security problems at the oil and gas facilities.

""I don't think that's going on, certainly in no serious way,"" he said.

1592,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 05:07AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Japan's new advanced fighter may be based on existing foreign design - sources,"By Tim Kelly and Nobuhiro Kubo
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is seeking proposals for a new advanced jet fighter based on an existing Western aircraft and wants American and British cooperation to help kick-start development of the project, which is estimated to cost around $40 billion, three sources said.
Japan this month issued a third request for information (RFI) to defense companies, seeking proposals for the new aircraft, dubbed the F-3. Unlike the first two requests, this one went only to foreign companies in the United States and Europe, with a separate, more detailed document delivered to London and Washington, according to the sources, who have direct knowledge of the requests. 
""Japan expects specific proposals for designs based on existing aircraft,"" said one of the sources. The two previous RFIs did not attract any detailed proposals, he added.
The requests for a design based on existing aircraft and the separate documents sent to the British and U.S. governments have not been previously reported.
The sources declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media.
Existing airframes Japan could use include the F-35 Lightning II stealth jet built by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) or Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet; and the Eurofighter Typhoon, manufactured by a European consortium including BAE Systems (LON:BAES) Plc.
Japan's last domestically produced jet fighter, the F-2, which entered service in 2000, was built jointly by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) and Lockheed Martin based on the U.S. F-16 multi-role fighter. As Japan's leading fighter maker, MHI, which built the World War Two-era A6M Zero, would anchor the Japanese share of the F-3 project. 
""We are considering domestic development, joint development and the possibility of improving existing aircraft performance, but we have not yet come to any decision,"" a Ministry of Defense representative said.
Building Japan's next-generation fighter based on a foreign aircraft already in service could save money, but come at the expense of advanced features like stealthy shaping. Neither the Typhoon nor Super Hornet are designed to be near-invisible to radar.
""Boeing is very interested in working with the U.S. and Japan governments in order to collaborate with Japanese industry on the next fighter program,” a Boeing spokesman said.
Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems, Britain's largest defense company, were not immediately available for comment. 
Japan's approaches to the U.S. and British government come as Washington considers its replacement for the F-22 Raptor. Britain, which has sought closer security ties to Japan, including cooperation on developing other defense equipment, may eventually need a fighter to succeed the Typhoon.
Japan, which is buying the radar-evading F-35 stealth jet to modernize its air defenses in the face of growing Chinese military strength, wants to introduce a separate air superiority fighter in the 2030s to help deter intrusions into its airspace. 
Japan has so far struggled to come up with its own design for a new aircraft, raising a question mark over the country's first jet fighter program since the F-2. 
Japan will need begin preliminary talks with Washington soon if it wants to include anything substantial about the F-3 in the new five-year defense equipment plan, which begins in April 2019. Details on that plan will be released at the end of the year, another of the sources said.
Although some defense ministry officials and lawmakers have lobbied for a domestically made aircraft to help sustain Japan defense companies hurt by increased spending on U.S. gear, finance officials have questioned whether that is cost effective. 
Opting for international cooperation should lower the cost of a new jet by expanding the number of users, spreading the unit cost beyond Japan's air force.

Mitsubishi Heavy tested a prototype stealth jet in 2016, the ATD-X or X-2, which cost the Japanese government $350 million to develop.

1593,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 07:10PM ET</span>",U.S. wary of North Korea weapons advances while talks take place,"By Matt Spetalnick, David Brunnstrom and Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea could buy time to build up and refine its nuclear arsenal, including a warhead able to survive re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere, if it manages to drag out any talks with Washington, U.S. officials and experts say. 
Even if North Korea freezes nuclear detonations and missile tests during such talks - as South Korea has said Pyongyang offered to do - there is plenty of other technical work it could pursue while diplomatic efforts are under way, they say.
Such work could include completing development of a re-entry vehicle that can deliver a nuclear weapon, production of rocket frames, engines and mobile launchers and increasing the output of plutonium and highly enriched uranium for bomb-making.
“North Korea can be expected to proceed on all these things ... unless an agreement freezes or stops these activities, something unlikely in the short run,” said David Albright, a nuclear non-proliferation expert who heads Washington's Institute for Science and International Security.
President Donald Trump has said Pyongyang seems ""sincere"" in its offer of talks, but some in Washington are wary that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may be using it as a stalling tactic for further weapons development – especially of a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland - and to seek relief from tough international sanctions.
U.S. intelligence officials have said Kim is only months away from being able to mount such a strike, while some experts say he may already have the basic capability, even if it remains untested.
The Trump administration must weigh such risks, including North Korea’s history of reneging on commitments, in deciding whether to go to the negotiating table, U.S. officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Proponents of engagement, including Joel Wit, a senior fellow at Washington's U.S.-Korea Institute, said the fact that North Korea was unlikely to agree to a complete freeze of activity should not be an obstacle.
""These programs are going to continue, but if we have a suspension of nuclear tests and missile tests, that’s a good first step here. It’s better than not having one,"" he said. 
U.S. officials said Trump would be prepared to quickly pull the plug on diplomacy if it becomes obvious that Pyongyang is just trying to drag out talks.
One administration official said that while it was unclear how long Trump might keep the negotiating window open, it would likely be evident in months “if North Korea is just playing us.” 
RE-ENTRY VEHICLE CHALLENGE
Either way, U.S. officials and experts agree there is value in getting North Korea to put its testing on hold as launches and detonations are vital to developing reliable weapons.
North Korea has tested dozens of missiles of various types in the past two years, including one launch of its largest-ever intercontinental ballistic missile, which is theoretically capable of hitting anywhere in the United States, on Nov. 29. There have since been no more tests.
South Korean envoys, who met Kim in Pyongyang this week and who are due in Washington to brief U.S. officials on Thursday, said he offered to suspend all nuclear and missile tests while conducting talks with the United States.
They said Kim also expressed a willingness to denuclearize, something he previously declared non-negotiable, if his country’s security was guaranteed.
U.S. and South Korean officials worry that North Korea will ultimately lay down impossible demands in talks – such as the complete withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea - and once diplomacy fails, emerge as an even greater threat than before.
Perhaps North Korea's biggest challenge, experts say, is to show it can produce a re-entry vehicle robust enough to prevent a nuclear warhead burning up when it hurtles back into the Earth's atmosphere. 
Some of that work can be done on the ground, although a live test will eventually be needed as North Korea has never flown a missile at a trajectory that would simulate a long-range flight, experts say.
U.S. officials and experts believe North Korea also needs more time to create facilities capable of mass-producing missiles, engines and other components - a challenge to any country even without the constraints of stringent international sanctions.
To create a credible deterrent to the United States, North Korea would have to show it has the ability to launch multiple missiles at once to circumvent U.S. anti-missile defenses in the event of war.
It also needs additional transporter-erector launchers, or TELs, to enable it to fire missiles from hastily established positions less vulnerable to detection and attack than permanent launch sites.
At the same time, negotiations are unlikely to stop North Korea from continuing to seek materials and help from outside the country for its weapons programs.

“North Korea needs considerable outside help to outfit and sustain its missile and nuclear production,” Albright said. “Keeping the pressure up and implementing sanctions and export controls better is critical whatever happens.”

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Male-dominated panels - or ""manels"" - remain prevalent at policy events in the European Union, with women averaging only one in four conference speakers, a report has found.
Despite women's campaigns globally for proportionate representation in policy-making across society, the report found that little progress had been made at congresses over the five years it reviewed.
Only one out of almost two dozen annual high-profile policy meetings studied by the Open Society Foundations had invited as many women as men to speak at the conference.
""The policies being debated affect women and men equally - it's perplexing that in 2018 women still don't have an equal opportunity to shape them,"" the report's author Christal Morehouse said.
The study entitled ""An End to Manels: Closing the Gender Gap at Europe's Top Policy Events,"" whose publication on Thursday was timed to coincide with International Women's Day, reviewed data on 12,600 speaking roles from 2012 to mid-2017. 
Women were most sparsely represented at the annual Globesec Bratislava Forum on security, where they made up 12 percent of speakers over the five-year period.
International policymakers attending the yearly Munich Security Conference hear three female speakers for every 17 men, the study found, while the Davos World Economic Forum featured one woman for every four men.
Only two of the annual forums showed a marked improvement in gender balance during the period studied: the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Forum and the Chatham House London Conference.
The prevalence of male speakers over women on panels is often the result of organizers prizing seniority over gender equality, said Sarah Charlotte Henkel, program officer at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.
""The inequality on panels is often also a mirror of gender-inequality within institutions,"" said Henkel. She added that women must start supporting one another to achieve greater representation in their institutions.
One new initiative in Brussels strives to do just that. Launched this year, the Brussels Binder is a new online database of female policy experts.
The gender equality campaign group says the database should make it easier to find women speakers for conferences, putting pressure on organizers to do away with all-male panels.

The conservative former leaders said they were detained at Havana airport on their arrival in the country to receive the award on behalf of the Democratic Initiative of Spain and the Americas (IDEA), a forum of 37 former presidents and heads of state.
""The Cuban dictatorship deported us today from the island for defending the democratic principles of the region,"" Pastrana wrote on Twitter. He also posted a photo of himself and Quiroga aboard a plane, flashing an ""L"" sign with their thumbs and forefingers to signify ""libertad"" (freedom).
The Cuban foreign ministry declined to comment on the incident. But the Communist Party newspaper Granma accused IDEA, in an editorial Wednesday headlined ""Prizes, provocations and failed ideas,"" of seeking to sabotage ""progressive projects"" across Latin America.
""As in 2017, the delivery of the prize is accompanied by a plan to stage a provocation in the Cuban capital this week, create instability and damage the country's international image,"" Granma wrote.
The Colombian foreign ministry said in a statement it had contacted the Cuban government about the incident and was told by the Cuban embassy in Colombia that Pastrana had been informed on Tuesday he would not be admitted to the island because of his planned attendance at IDEA. 
""The Colombian government regrets that these kind of incidents happen to Colombians who have been friends of countries close to ours,"" the statement added.
Foreign dignitaries were also denied entry to Cuba last year when the Latin American Network of Youth for Democracy, a dissident group critical of Cuba's government, awarded its international prize for human rights and democracy on the island for the first time. 

Cuba brands dissidents as mercenaries, funded by foreign governments and exiles and out to topple the government.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - South Korean envoys briefed American officials on Thursday on their unprecedented meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, while the U.S. secretary of state said that though ""talks about talks"" might be possible with Pyongyang, denuclearization negotiations were likely a long way off.
South Korea's National Security Office head Chung Eui-yong and National Intelligence Service chief Suh Hoon flew to Washington where they were expected to explain North Korea's stance on possible future talks with Washington and the prospect of Pyongyang suspending nuclear tests if the security of the North's government is assured.
Chung, who led a South Korean delegation for a first-ever meeting with Kim on Monday, met U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster at the White House, beginning a round of discussions with senior administration officials. A South Korean official said President Donald Trump or Vice President Mike Pence might also join in.
Speaking during a trip to Ethiopia, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said South Korea was keeping the United States ""well informed,"" but suggested actual negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang were a ways off.
""In terms of direct talks with the United States ... we're a long ways from negotiations,"" Tillerson told a news conference in Addis Ababa.
""We just need to be very clear-eyed and realistic about it,"" Tillerson added. ""I think the first step ... is to have talks, have some kind of talks about talks, because I don't know yet, until we are able to meet, ourselves, face to face with representatives of North Korea, whether the conditions are right to even begin thinking about negotiations.""
Tillerson also reiterated previous calls for African states to cut ties with North Korea. Pyongyang has more than a dozen embassies on the continent, and the Trump administration has said it earns hard currency from arms deals with African governments and trafficking wildlife parts from Africa.
Monday's meeting with Kim Jong Un was the culmination of a series of North-South contacts that have helped ease fears of war in a standoff over Pyongyang's development of nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States. 
LINGERING TENSIONS
In another sign of lingering tensions, the two Koreas will not march together at the opening ceremony of the Winter Paralympics, as they did at the Olympics last month in South Korea, because they cannot agree on a united flag that erases islands disputed with Japan, officials said.
Tensions over North Korea rose to their highest in years in 2017, and the Trump administration has warned that all options are on the table, including military ones, in dealing with Pyongyang, which has pursued its weapons programs in defiance of ever tougher U.N. sanctions.
Signs of a thaw emerged this year, with North and South Korea resuming talks and North Korea attending the Winter Olympics. During the Pyongyang talks this week, the two Koreas agreed to hold their first summit since 2007 in late April. 
South Korean President Moon Jae-in has said sanctions should not be eased for the sake of talks and that nothing less than denuclearization of North Korea should be the final goal for talks.
China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, called on the United States and North Korea to hold talks as soon as possible, warning at a news briefing in Beijing on Thursday that things ""will not be smooth sailing"".

A senior U.S. administration official said no decision on the possibility of the United States joining a summit of North and South Korea was expected to be made at the meeting with McMaster. Those discussions would be conducted in private among U.S. officials, the source said.

Two herders went missing in the central state of Benue on Monday and one was later found dead, a state police spokesman said.
In revenge, a group armed with machetes attacked people, including women and children, in the district of Okpokwu the same day, the spokesman said. Twenty-four people died in that violence, he added.
""Four suspects have so far been arrested in connection with the gruesome murder,"" the spokesman said.
Some opposition politicians have accused Buhari of failing to take action against the herders because they are his ethnic and religious kin - an accusation his supporters dismiss.
The herders are mostly Muslims from Buhari's Fulani ethnic group, while the majority of the farmers are Christians of other ethnicities. 
Many of the clashes between the communities, triggered by competition over dwindling arable land, have become part of a cycle of revenge attacks that shows little sign of abating.

The stabbings - the first of which took place at 7:45 p.m. (1845 GMT), occurred in Vienna's Second District, which includes the famous Prater park as well as the Praterstern transport hub. It also houses much of Vienna's small Jewish community.

Londono is running for the unarmed reincarnation of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, guerrilla group, in the May election. 
Local media has speculated he may have to stand down in order to recover, but the party has not directly addressed the issue.
Known by his rebel nom de guerre Timochenko, he was hospitalized on Thursday with chest pains. He is being treated for coronary problems as well as pulmonary sickness and an obstructed cerebral artery. 
""The general evolution of the patient is as expected for the type and complexity of the surgery performed, and the short- and medium-term prognosis will be established in the following hours,"" the Shaio Clinic said in a statement.
Londono, 59, has long suffered heart problems and had surgery in Cuba while negotiating the terms of a 2016 peace deal with the government.
He was taken to the hospital last week after his daily exercise routine, the group said.
The FARC kept its Spanish-language acronym after demobilization but changed its name to the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force.
Londono suspended campaigning last month because of security concerns after angry protests disrupted campaign stops.
The FARC was known during its long-running armed conflict for kidnappings, bombings and forced displacements. Many Colombians believe its members should be in prison, not campaigning, and recent opinion polls have shown Londono has as little as 1 percent support.

The party has focused its political platform on fighting poverty.

1601,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 12:35AM ET</span>",Mexico says progress needed before president meets Trump,"By Dave Graham and Frank Jack Daniel
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - White House advisor Jared Kushner left Mexico City on Wednesday with prospects no nearer for a summit between his father-in-law President Donald Trump and Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto, as both sides said progress on joint policy concerns was needed first.
Kushner met with Pena Nieto and other top Mexican officials in a bid to soothe recent tensions after it emerged that a phone call between the two presidents had gone badly due to Trump's insistence that Mexico pay for a border wall he wants to build to stop illegal immigrants.
During the past week, Trump delivered several barbs against Mexico, whose leaders were dismayed by the U.S. president's decision to announce protectionist tariffs during complex talks to rework the NAFTA trade pact.
After Kushner left, Mexico's foreign ministry said officials from both nations agreed that any possible meeting between Trump and Pena Nieto would depend on progress made on areas of mutual concern such as revamping NAFTA, security and migration.
The ministry issued a short statement saying that Kushner, who came with other U.S. officials, had discussed issues such as the fight against drug trafficking, border security, migration, jobs and Central America with his Mexican counterparts.
It made no mention of the border wall or how progress might be measured.
Pena Nieto was accompanied by Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo and Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, who earlier held a separate meeting with Kushner at his ministry.
Spirits briefly improved during Kushner's trip when the White House said it might exempt Mexico and Canada from Trump's planned tariffs on steel and aluminum, an idea he has floated as a trade-off in return for progress on NAFTA.
Mexican diplomats and opposition leaders had been skeptical about how much Kushner could achieve on his visit, despite the close relationship he has forged with Videgaray. They also doubted his presence would change Trump's attitude to Mexico.
""I don't doubt that Kushner will say positive things, because he's not Trump,"" said Agustin Basave, a senior opposition lawmaker in the Party of the Democratic Revolution.
""But it doesn't mean a thing if the next day - or even the same night - Trump sends a tweet saying the opposite.""
Many officials in Mexico argue Pena Nieto has little to gain from meeting Trump and are doubtful it will happen soon given the American's unpopularity south of the border and penchant for blaming Mexicans for the United States' problems.
A senior U.S. official said one goal of Kushner's trip was to reduce tensions after the testy phone call between the two leaders, that U.S. officials said led to the postponement of a planned summit.
The call also dampened the mood at the outset of a seventh round of talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The talks ended on Monday in Mexico City. 
Talks between Kushner and Economy Minister Guajardo is Mexico's top NAFTA negotiator, broached the subject of working towards a ""speedy"" renegotiation of the deal, Mexico's government said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Venezuelan state governor made an unusual visit to Washington this week, seeking meetings in Congress to discuss the fate of a U.S. citizen imprisoned in the South American nation, U.S. sources said on Wednesday.
As the threat of fresh U.S. sanctions on socialist Venezuela loomed, Rafael Lacava, governor of Venezuela's Carabobo state, requested meetings to discuss Josh Holt, a Mormon missionary from Utah. He and his Venezuelan wife, Thamara Caleno, have been held since they were arrested in 2016 on weapons charges after Holt traveled to Venezuela for their wedding.
""We are aware that (Lacava) is here. There are suspicions that the Venezuela government is using the illegitimate detention of Mr Holt as a bargaining chip to talk about U.S. sanctions,"" a U.S. official said.
""We continue to call for the immediate and unconditional release of Mr Holt and until he is released we continue to insist on regular ongoing consular contacts with him as called for under international law,"" the official said.
It is unusual for an official allied with Venezuela's socialist government, a U.S. adversary, to visit Washington for such meetings.
President Donald Trump's administration is considering new sanctions targeting Venezuela's oil sector to increase pressure on President Nicolas Maduro ahead of an election Washington and its allies consider a sham.
Maduro confirmed Lacava's visit during a speech in Caracas, saying: ""He's gone to Washington for some peace efforts.""
Another U.S. source familiar with the situation confirmed Lacava was visiting to discuss Holt, but did not believe sanctions would be discussed in Congress since lawmakers would defer to the administration on any such matter.
""While I am not able to speculate on what else might be on Mr Lacava's agenda, I want to make very clear that the sole purpose of such meetings would be to encourage the release of Mr Holt and his wife,"" the source said.
""There would be no negotiation, and any claim to the contrary is simply false,"" the source said.
Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah and other lawmakers are working for Holt's release.

""While Senator Hatch prefers to not share details of sensitive meetings related to his nearly two year effort to have Josh Holt released on humanitarian grounds, he is optimistic he is making progress and will continue to work with the State Department and colleagues in the Congress to identify those to meet and work with who can get it done,"" Hatch spokesman Matt Whitlock said.

Ramadan is a grandson of Hasan al-Banna, an Islamist thinker and activist who founded the Muslim Brotherhood. He enjoys a substantial following among young Muslims and has challenged French restrictions on wearing veils.

No date was set for an arraignment, at which Cruz will be allowed to enter a plea, said Constance Simmons, a spokeswoman for the Broward County state attorney's office.
The 19-year-old former student is accused of using a semiautomatic assault rifle to kill 17 students and faculty members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland on Feb. 14.
He faces a maximum sentence of either execution or life in prison without parole if convicted. The public defender's office in Broward County has said Cruz was willing to plead guilty if county prosecutors choose not to pursue the death penalty. 
The prosecutors' office has said a decision on this has not yet been made, according to Simmons. 
The attack, one of the deadliest at a school in a country where school shootings happen multiple times a year, has reignited a national debate about overhauling gun laws in Florida and beyond.

1605,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 02:49PM ET</span>",ICRC says has more 'cooperative' access to detained Islamic State families,"By Raya Jalabi
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The International Committee of the Red Cross said on Wednesday it had ""increasingly cooperative"" access to families of suspected Islamic State militants whose safety in detention has been a focus of concern for foreign aid agencies.
More than 1,000 wives and children have been held in Iraq since the defeat of Islamic State militants in August 2017, and some of the women have gone on trial for joining Islamic State.
The ICRC has had intermittent access to the families, giving humanitarian aid and helping coordinate contact with relatives or officials in their countries of origin.
Foreign aid agencies said last year they were ""gravely concerned"" about the fate of the families.
""With regard to families of foreign fighters: ICRC has had various but increasingly cooperative accesses to those families,"" ICRC President Peter Maurer told reporters during a visit to Baghdad. 
""We were able to bring assistance to those families in need, to reestablish some minimal contacts with family members abroad."" 
The families mostly came from Turkey, France, Germany and former Soviet states, such as Tajikistan, Azerbaijan and Russia.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
First detained in a camp near Mosul, the families were moved to a military base in Baghdad in November, as Iraq's government deliberated over their fates. The move to the capital coincided with a push by Iraqi officials to begin legal proceedings.
Last month, Baghdad Criminal Court sentenced 17 women to death for joining Islamic State and handed over four women and 27 children to Russia who were not prosecuted after investigations concluded that they did not participate in ""terrorist operations."" 
Thousands of foreigners have fought on behalf of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria since at least 2014. Many foreign women came - or were brought - from overseas to join the militants.
The ICRC has called on all sides in the Iraq and Syria wars to treat detainees in line with international law that prohibits torture or executions and enshrines the right to a fair trial.
The detention of the militants and their families is a particularly ""complex issue"", Maurer said, but one the ICRC was continuing to help ""in the months and years to come.""
Part of the ICRC mandate is to help secure humane treatment and conditions of detainees held in the countries in which the organization operates. 
Despite Iraq having declared victory over the militants in December after a three-year-war which devastated large parts of the country, the country's detainee population ""will continue to increase in the foreseable future,"" Maurer said.
Maurer said the ICRC aims to see those people in detention and those in ""detention-like set-ups."" 
Iraq has a ""particularly diversified"" setup regarding detentions, he said, as both the state and the various armed groups operating in the country hold detainees. 
""It's not secret as well that we don’t have access to all detainees in all situations,"" he said.

Maurer, who was in Iraq visiting the ICRC delegation, said Iraq's humanitarian needs remain ""huge"", despite the country having declared victory over the militants last December.

The Washington museum's rescission of its Elie Wiesel Award to Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner, is the latest honor to be retracted over her silence about widespread abuses against the Rohingya.
Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy have refused to cooperate with United Nations investigators, fed hate attacks on the Rohingya and denied reporters access to areas where alleged abuses have taken place, the museum said in a letter to Suu Kyi that was posted on its website.
""It is with great regret that we are now rescinding that award. We did not take this decision likely,"" it said in the letter dated March 6.
The Myanmar Embassy in Washington said it regretted that the museum had been ""misled and exploited by people who failed to see the true situation"" in the western state of Rakhine.
The decision to rescind the award would ""have no bearing on the determination of the Myanmar people in supporting the leadership"" of Suu Kyi, the embassy said in a statement dated March 7.
The government would ""redouble its efforts in finding a lasting solution"" for Rakhine State, it said.
The United Nations and human rights organizations have collected evidence of widespread abuses by the Myanmar military against the largely stateless Rohingya, including murder, rape and arson. The attacks have prompted nearly 700,000 to flee to neighboring Bangladesh.
Buddhist-majority Myanmar denies the abuse charges and says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against ""terrorists"" it blames for attacks on security forces.
The plight of the Rohingya has sparked outrage around the world. There have been calls for Suu Kyi to be stripped of her Nobel prize, won for her pro-democracy fight, for not speaking out to condemn the Myanmar military's actions.

Suu Kyi is Myanmar's state counselor and foreign minister. She has had other honors rescinded, including the freedoms of the cities of Dublin and Oxford, England. Last month, three Nobel peace laureates urged Suu Kyi and the military to end the ""genocide"" of Rohingya Muslims now or face prosecution.

In public, new President Emmerson Mnangagwa has continued to refer to 94-year-old Mugabe as an ""icon"" for leading Zimbabwe's independence war, but news this week that Mugabe is backing a new political party has soured relations between him and his ex-comrades.
At a meeting with Mnangagwa at the ruling party headquarters in Harare, ZANU-PF youths took turns to denounce Mugabe while hailing the leadership of Mnangagwa, who sat smiling, flanked by senior party officials.
The youths chanted ""Down with Robert Mugabe,"" a slogan the former ruler had used himself in irony against rivals since the country won independence from Britain in 1980.
Young party members and party officials have so far refrained from condemning Mugabe, instead denouncing his allies.
But the signs of his fall from favor across society are growing. The state-owned Herald newspaper, which had previously referred to Mugabe as ""Comrade"" after his resignation, on Wednesday began refer to him as ""Mr"", a title usually reserved for opposition rivals.
The New Patriotic Front, a new party headed by former army general and Mugabe loyalist Ambrose Mutinhiri, said it has Mugabe's support and will challenge Mnangagwa at polls expected in a few months. [nL5N1QN4QF]
Mnangagwa told the youths gathered at the party headquarters that ZANU-PF was set for a landslide victory in the presidential, parliamentary and council elections due by Aug 21.

Since his fall from power, Mugabe has stayed at his Harare mansion with his wife Grace, but on Wednesday he left to visit South Africa for unknown reasons.

GENEVA (Reuters) - An easing of international tensions with North Korea should lead to dialogue with Pyongyang to prevent continued ""grave abuses"" such as torture and political prison camps, a U.N. human rights investigator said on Wednesday.
Tomas Ojea Quintana, special rapporteur on human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), called on authorities there to release nine foreign nationals and resolve long-standing cases of abductions of South Koreans and Japanese.
Ojea Quintana, whose report to the Human Rights Council was based mainly on interviews with North Koreans living in South Korea and Japan, is not allowed into the reclusive country.
North Korea has never accepted the investigator's mandate. ""It is a dead document,"" a North Korean diplomat, commenting on the latest report, told Reuters.
A 2014 U.N. commission of inquiry documented massive violations that it said may amount to crimes against humanity - including large prison camps, starvation and executions.
Ojea Quintana said that his information ""indicates continuing patterns of serious violations made worse by a climate of political volatility and conflict rhetoric"" over North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pyongyang has boasted of its plans to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the mainland United States. But fears of war eased last month, coinciding with North Korea's participation in the Winter Olympics in the South Korean resort of Pyeongchang. 
""It is important that the momentum that has been enabled by the Winter Olympics be used to discuss possibilities for bilateral technical support that may help tackle some of the urgent human rights challenges in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,"" Ojea Quintana said.
The two Koreas should seize this momentum to resume family reunions for divided families - stalled since late 2015 - early this year as a ""starting point for human rights dialogue"", he added.
The dialogue should include resolving ""inconsistent accounts"" on the case of 12 female North Korean restaurant workers in China who Pyongyang says were abducted in 2016, he said. South Korea, where they now live, say the women defected. 
He urged China to halt its ""forced repatriations"" of North Koreans crossing the border, whom Beijing regards as economic migrants and not as people fleeing persecution, saying they faced the risk of torture on return.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Wednesday sanctions on North Korea will not be eased for the sake of a summit between the two sides. 
Referring to six South Korean nationals and three U.S. citizens detained in Pyongyang on charges of plotting hostile acts, Ojea Quintana said:

""The release of the remaining foreign detainees would help improve the country's international stance and bring further appeasement to the political and security situation.""

1610,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>","Matteo Salvini, the everyman leader of Italy's populist revolt","By Isla Binnie and Steve Scherer
ROME (Reuters) - Matteo Salvini is a euroskeptic, far-right nationalist whose Donald Trump-like ""Italians First"" slogan resonated after years of anemic growth and mass migration, giving him a shot at becoming Italy's next prime minister.
His League party - with or without its center-right allies - could form a populist government with the anti-system 5-Star Movement, confirming the worst fears of Europe's establishment. The League would play second fiddle, having won 17 percent of the vote versus more than 32 percent for 5-Star.
But whether such a government takes office will only be known in April, when President Sergio Mattarella begins consultations following the inconclusive vote.
For now, Salvini is asserting his leadership over Italy's right, after dethroning four-time prime minister Silvio Berlusconi from a role the media magnate had played for almost a quarter of a century.
Salvini prevailed with a laser-like focus on the issues of mass immigration, tax cuts and pensions, capitalizing not only on his popularity on the TV talk show circuit, but also by incessantly pecking Tweets on his iPad or shooting a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) live in a car while hurtling toward his next appointment. 
Bearded, stocky and casually dressed, the 44-year-old Salvini showed his stamina on the campaign trail.
""I'm lucky enough not to need sleep, but after two or three days following him around, I'm dead,"" said League economics chief Claudio Borghi, who has worked closely with Salvini and is behind the party's anti-euro stance.
On the last day of the campaign, Salvini Tweeted: ""After more than 300 rallies and 5 kilos (11 pounds) lighter, I'm tired but happy.""
Salvini's euroskeptism is what concerns investors most, but no other large parties are questioning the single currency, so there appears to be no way to form an anti-euro government.
But a populist government that wants to throw off the shackles of EU-imposed budget austerity and espouses a much more virulent stance toward the hundreds of thousands of boat migrants who have come to Italy in recent years is possible, and Salvini would be the perfect spokesman for it.
""AUTHENTIC""
In his youth, Salvini was in the communist phalange of the Northern League. Then he set aside his left-wing sympathies to become a Milan city councillor for many years, taking over the party in a 2013 primary against its founder Umberto Bossi, who had been engulfed in a corruption scandal.
Bossi's party had lobbied for the north, demanding that tax money should not be funneled to the country's underdeveloped south. Salvini transformed it into a national force, upsetting veterans who felt it should remain loyal to its original roots.
Dropping the rhetoric against the poor southerners, Salvini instead took aim at African migrants and hooked up with Europe's extreme right, including the National Front of France's Marine Le Pen and the Dutch Freedom Party of Geert Wilders. 
One of the few Italians to welcome Britain's decision to leave the European Union, Salvini also flew to the United States in 2016 during the presidential campaign to have his picture taken with Trump. He also sings the praises of Russia's Vladimir Putin. 
Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist, said Salvini was one of the leaders of Italy's ""populist, nationalist revolt"", adding that he came across as an ""authentic"" personality capable of providing ""solutions to problems"", as he said Trump has done in the United States.
""People are tired of the double talk, they're tired of the political correctness,"" Bannon told Reuters last week. 
In the last days of the campaign Salvini appealed to Italy's Catholics by waving rosary prayer beads and a bible in front of crowds in Milan as he swore to be faithful to his people.
While very much a straight talker, Salvini is no Trump. He rarely commits a gaffe and sticks closely to his script. Unlike Berlusconi, Salvini was happy to meet the foreign press before the vote and never lost his cool during a prolonged grilling.
But that does not mean Salvini is not divisive. Using ""stop the invasion"" as a slogan, the League attacked the ruling center-left Democratic Party (PD) for its handling of the migrant crisis. In Tweets and on TV, Salvini portrayed migrants as criminals and called for mass deportations.
After a top League politician said Italy's ""white race"" was under threat, Salvini supported him. 
""We are under attack. Our culture, society, traditions and way of life are at risk,"" he said.
After a Nigerian migrant was arrested on suspicion of killing an Italian teenager, Salvini wrote: ""What was this worm still doing in Italy? The left has blood on its hands.""
Days later, a man with neo-Nazi sympathies and ties to the League opened fire on African migrants in the city of Macerata, wounding six before he was captured.
In Florence, a day after the election, an Italian man shot a Senegalese immigrant six times, killing him. The shooter was in a state of confusion, police said, denying it was a racist attack. But the city's Senegalese community blamed Salvini.

""We all saw Salvini for months and months spread a hateful and racist message,"" Pape Diaw, a representative of Florence's Senegalese community, told Reuters at a protest by 500 people on Tuesday on the bridge where the murder took place.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - El Al Israel Airlines has appealed to the United Nations over a bid to reroute its services between Tel Aviv and India through Saudi Arabian airspace.
Air India said on Wednesday it planned to begin thrice-weekly non-stop flights from Delhi to Tel Aviv this month via Saudi airspace. This route, shorter than the alternatives, has so far been off limits to all Israel-bound commercial planes.
The Israeli flag carrier's CEO Gonen Usishkin said in a letter to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), a U.N. body, it would be discriminatory for the Saudis to allow Air India to enter its airspace and not El Al. 
Saudi Arabia does not recognize Israel and lifting the airspace ban for El Al would offer further evidence of what appears to be thawing of ties. Both are U.S. allies with a shared concern over Iranian influence in the region.
Flying through Saudi airspace will cut the Delhi-Tel Aviv journey time by about two hours, an Air India spokesman said.
In his letter, Usishkin told ICAO head Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu that would give Air India ""a significant and unfair advantage"" over El Al that would clearly violate equality in aviation.
El Al flies to Mumbai four times a week, along a route over Ethiopia and then east to India that, by avoiding Saudi airspace, has a journey time of seven hours rather than five.
Usishkin said giving Air India preference would also violate the Chicago Convention, under which countries may not impose restrictions on flying over their territory or discriminate against airlines based on nationality.
Israel, Saudi Arabia and India are parties to the convention.
""I am requesting that the ICAO, which has the power to enforce the provisions of the Chicago Convention, take action ...to procure equal permission for El Al to fly above Saudi Arabia,"" Usishkin said.

Last week, El Al sought help over the issue from industry lobby group the International Air Transport Association.

Nigerian-born Toni Iwobi moved to Italy in 1976 and joined the League in 1993, serving as a local councillor. He was elected to the upper house on Sunday to represent the northern city of Bergamo - the League's heartland.
""Perhaps I'm blind or perhaps they haven't yet told him that he is black. But shame on you!!!"" Balotelli wrote on Instagram.
The post showed a photograph of Iwobi with League leader Matteo Salvini, both wearing T-shirts saying: ""Stop the Invasion"" - a reference to the party's call for a halt to African migrants who have poured into Italy in recent years.
Balotelli was born in Sicily to Ghanaian immigrants. He has played more than 30 times for the Italian national team and plays club soccer for French side Nice.
The League has adopted an uncompromising anti-migrant stance, drawn up with the help of Iwobi, and has called for the deportation of some 600,000 immigrants, many from Africa, who have reached Italy over the past four years.
However, the party has said it supports legal migration. Iwobi came to Italy legally on a student visa and subsequently married an Italian. He went on to set up an IT company.
League leader Matteo Salvini immediately leapt to Iwobi's defense. ""I don't like Balotelli on the field. I like him even less off it,"" he tweeted.
Iwobi wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB): ""These controversies don't interest me. There are more important things. I cannot wait to start serving my country.""

The decision marked a departure from practice under Islam Karimov, who ran Uzbekistan for 27 years until his death in 2016, when courts routinely dismissed torture complaints.
Journalist Bobomurod Abdullayev, 44, is accused of publishing stories criticizing the government and urging its overthrow on a website run by exiled opposition politicians over the last 14 years. 
Last week his lawyer Sergei Mayorov said in a statement that Abdullayev had been beaten, deprived of sleep and put in solitary confinement. Immediately after the trial began on Wednesday, Mayorov requested a medical examination and the inclusion in the case file of a complaint about the torture he said his client had suffered in detention since last September.
Head judge Zafar Nurmatov then asked Abdullayev, who sat behind bars alongside three co-defendants, to show if there were traces of torture on his body. Abdullayev took off his shirt and showed a bruised left arm.
The judge agreed to both requests after the prosecution lodged no objections and adjourned the hearings until after the medical examination.
Mayorov said his client, who wrote under the pen name Usman Haknazarov, would plead not guilty. Also on trial are an Uzbek blogger accused of receiving cash from an exiled politician, and two men accused of passing sensitive information to Abdullayev. The four men face up to 20 years in prison each.
Rights campaigners link the case to promises made by President Mirziyoyev after came to power in 2016 to liberalize the tightly-controlled former Soviet republic.
""This case is an extremely important test of whether President Mirziyoyev's stated goals of reform are genuine - whether people have the right to peacefully criticize the government,"" said Steve Swerdlow, Central Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch.
""Under international and Uzbek law and a new decree President Mirziyoyev recently signed into law, no evidence obtained through torture will be admissible in court.""
Abdullayev was detained and investigated by the SNB state security service. Mirziyoyev sacked the once-influential SNB chairman, Rustam Inoyatov, in January and has accused the security service of abusing its powers.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The last leader of Argentina's 1976 - 1983 ""dirty war"" military dictatorship, Reynaldo Bignone, died in a military hospital on Wednesday, Argentina's state-run news agency Telam said. 
Bignone, 90, had been serving out jail sentences for conspiring to kidnap and kill opponents during his July 1982 to December 1983 rule. 
His death closes a brutal chapter in Argentina's history, during which rights groups say military rule was responsible for ""disappearing"" - a euphemism for kidnapping and murdering opponents - some 30,000 people.
Argentina started its transition to democracy in 1983 with an October election called by Bignone. 
He was one of 15 former military officials found guilty by an Argentine court in 2016 of conspiring to kidnap and assassinate leftist dissidents as part of the Operation Condor program.
Dictatorships in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil and Bolivia coordinated to hunt down and kill exiled opponents in the 1970s and 1980s. 
Argentina's first military leader Jorge Rafael Videla, who took over after a 1976 coup and ruled until 1981, died in 2013. Military leaders at the time said the crackdown they oversaw was necessary for Argentina to confront left-wing guerrilla groups. 
The government's credibility was weakened, however, during the 1982 Falklands War with Britain in which more than 600 Argentine soldiers died.
In December 1983, Bignone handed over power to democratically elected Raul Alfonsin. 

Particularly since the early 2000s, Argentina has held a series of trials for human rights abuse related to the dictatorship. Last year 29 people were given life sentences for crimes at the ESMA Naval Mechanics School, which was converted into a clandestine prison and torture chamber.

Murdoch was forced to shut his News of the World tabloid in 2011 after staff admitted hacking into phones to get scoops, sparking a criminal trial and a public inquiry. 
The activities of Murdoch's newspapers have returned to the spotlight as regulators examine a bid by his Twenty-First Century Fox for European pay-TV operator Sky. 
Ford said he had targeted 15-20 members of the Labour government elected in 1997 including Brown and his predecessor as Prime Minister Tony Blair, intercepting hundreds of phone conversations, obtaining bank account and utility bill information and searching rubbish bins.
He told the BBC he was paid by the Murdoch broadsheet for 15 years between 1995 and 2010, and that his actions were ""at the forefront"" of large-scale criminal activity on the part of the title. 
The Sunday Times, which said it had a strong record of investigative journalism over decades, denied his claims.
""The paper strongly rejects the accusation that it has in the past retained or commissioned any individual to act illegally,"" it said. 
Brown said that according to Ford's claims there were at least 25, and up to 40, violations of criminal law by the Murdoch group including impersonating him and tampering with his phone.
""This new evidence shows that even when under oath, what was then News International misled the (public) Leveson Inquiry,"" he said in a statement. 
""I am now calling for police to investigate this criminal wrongdoing.""
Britain said last week it would not proceed with the second part of the Leveson Inquiry into newspaper ethics. 
Media Secretary Matt Hancock said it was not in the national interest to go ahead with part two of the Leveson Inquiry which laid bare the cosy ties between British leaders, police chiefs and press barons in its initial conclusions in 2012.

The Saudi-led alliance, which has intervened in Yemen's war since 2015 to try to restore president Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to power, has conducted frequent air strikes and has sometimes hit civilians, although it denies ever doing so intentionally.
On Monday, a panel set up by the coalition to investigate civilian casualties, the Joint Incidents Assessment Team, said air strikes carried out in 2017 ""were in accordance with international humanitarian law and many of the alleged strikes were falsely attributed to the Coalition"".
The Houthis have controlled much of Yemen including the capital Sanaa since driving Hadi out three years ago. Saudi Arabia and its Sunni Muslim allies say the Houthis are armed by Shi'ite Iran and pose a threat to the region.
Residents said the attack early on Wednesday morning on the suburbs of the northern city of Saada, the stronghold of the Houthis, killed a woman and a young girl and also wounded several children from the same family, according to a Reuters witness at the local hospital.
""There were three [strikes] on our house and one on my father's house,"" said Helal Ahmed Saleh, one of those of injured during the strike.
""When they hit mine, I was running and calling for someone to help us, but then the fourth one hit my father's house and the shrapnel hit me.""
The war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than two million and driven the country - already the poorest on the Arabian Peninsula - to the verge of widespread famine.
In a speech to the U.N. Human Rights Council on Wednesday, U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein said Yemeni civilians had suffered indiscriminate shelling and sniper attacks by Houthi and affiliated forces, as well as air strikes conducted by the Saudi-led coalition. 
On Friday, the U.N. High Commission for Refugees reported that seven displaced Yemeni civilians were killed in Saada on Feb. 28, the first IDP deaths in 2018 the team had verified.
The UNHCR did not confirm the nature of the incident, but residents had told Reuters earlier that air strikes killed nine civilians in Yemen on that day, with four of the deaths occurring in Saada's suburbs.
""We have seen that as conflict prolongs in Yemen, the protection of civilians continues to rapidly deteriorate,"" Shabia Mantoo, a spokesperson for the U.N. refugee agency in Yemen, told Reuters, commenting on the Feb 28 incident.
""It's especially tragic and deplorable that these civilians who died had tried to flee for safety and protection, only to face danger in the area to which they fled. This shows that nowhere in Yemen is particularly safe.""

This year, thousands of Venezuelans have been pouring across the border, some as migrants, others as visiting shoppers seeking basic goods as a devastating economic crisis has made many items scarce in their home country.
""Like we have done historically every time there are elections in national territory, the close of the our country's borders has been ordered, with the goal of maintaining public order during the voting period,"" Christian Kruger, the head of the migration agency, said in a statement.
Borders will shut at 6 p.m. local time on Thursday and re-open after polls close at 4 p.m. on Sunday, the statement said. There will be extra staff on hand to process waiting travelers once the checkpoints re-open, it said.
More than half a million Venezuelans have fled to Colombia, while another 650,000 are said to have entered the country on their way to other destinations or on a visit before returning home. The figures do not include thousands who are estimated to have crossed the border illegally.

The 700-member body last met in 2009, in what was termed an emergency session, to replace six of the 18 members of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the largest party in the parliament.
""The Palestinian National Council (PNC) will convene on April 30th, to discuss challenges to the Palestinian cause, especially after the U.S. decision against Jerusalem,"" PLO official Wasel Abu Youssef told Reuters, using parliament's formal name.
He said the decision to hold what he called a ""regular session"" of parliament in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, was taken at a PLO Executive Committee meeting chaired by President Mahmoud Abbas.
Palestinian leaders said after Trump's Dec. 6 declaration on Jerusalem that Washington could no longer take the lead in Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts. U.S.-brokered talks collapsed in 2014.
Trump's announcement and the planned move in May of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem - home to sites holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians - reversed decades of U.S. policy on the city. Its status is one of the biggest obstacles to reaching a peace agreement.
Abu Youssef said members of parliament from the Palestinian territories and in exile would also elect members to the Executive Committee and the PLO's Central Council to replace several who have died and others, whom political sources said Abbas wants replaced.
The PNC last held a regular session in 1996, in the presence of then-U.S. President Bill Clinton. At that meeting, the parliament voted in favor of amending clauses in the PLO's charter that advocated Israel's destruction.
A Palestinian general election has not been held since 2006, a national ballot won by the Hamas Islamist movement. Hamas seized the Gaza Strip in 2007 from forces loyal to Abbas after a unity government collapsed.
Abu Youssef said invitations for the upcoming meeting would be distributed to members of parliament in Gaza, the West Bank and in exile in the next two weeks. Delegates from outside the West Bank would need Israeli clearance to reach Ramallah, where the session will be held.

The move is aimed at removing bureaucracy impeding investigations of financial crime and was taken under international pressure on Nigeria to crack down on endemic corruption afflicting the economy and law enforcement.
Nigeria's upper legislative house, the Senate, adopted the bill on Wednesday, completing its passage through parliament after the lower house's approval on Tuesday. President Muhammadu Buhari would need to sign the legislation for it to come into force, but is expected to do so.
The new law makes the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit an independent body able to share information with counterparts abroad. Until now, the agency has operated under Nigeria's state Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.
Parliament acted after the Egmont Group, a body of 155 Financial Intelligence Units worldwide, threatened to delist Nigeria unless its own unit gained autonomy, enabling it to deal with financial crimes more effectively.
The Egmont Group insisted that failure to make Nigeria's unit legally independent would have subjected financial transactions from Nigeria, including funds transfers and credit cards, to special controls, banking sources said. This could mean a refusal to process tens of thousands of payments.
Banking transactions above a stipulated threshold are automatically sent to the Financial Intelligence Unit.
Nigeria suffers from rampant graft and is fighting Boko Haram militants in the northeast, who have killed more than 20,000 people since 2009 and displaced two million others in an insurgency aimed at creating an Islamic state.
Last week the U.S. Treasury Department added two individuals and seven organisations in Africa and Asia connected to Islamic State to its sanctions list for global terrorism.

Paul Golding, 36, leader of the anti-immigration Britain First party, and his deputy Jayda Fransen, 31, were convicted of filming and harassing people they believed were involved in a rape trial involving a number of Muslim men at a court in Canterbury, Kent.
They posted their actions on the Britain First website and also delivered offensive leaflets to homes in the area where those involved in the case lived, prosecutors told Folkestone magistrates court.
""The prosecution case demonstrated these defendants were not merely exercising their right to free speech but were instead aiming religiously aggravated abuse at innocent members of the public,"" Chief Crown Prosecutor Jaswant Narwal said in a statement.
Last November, Trump retweeted anti-Muslim videos posted by Fransen, drawing condemnation from across Britain including Prime Minister Theresa May.
Trump initially fired back at May, saying she should focus on ""the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom"", but in January he said he had not intended to cause offence in Britain and his retweet was not an endorsement.
""If you're telling me they're horrible people, horrible racist people, I would certainly apologize if you would like me to do that,"" Trump said in an interview with a British broadcaster.
Fransen, who was convicted last year for abusing a Muslim woman, said at the time she believed Trump had been ""railroaded"" into making an apology. She and Golding, who will both be sentenced at a later date, have accused the authorities of persecution.
Last week, Britain's most senior counter-terrorism officer warned Britain was facing a serious and growing threat from far-right terrorism, often fuelled by online extremism.

Strache led the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPO) to third place in last year's parliamentary election. It is now the junior coalition partner to Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conservatives, making Austria the only western European country to have a far-right party in government.
The FPO has long accused ORF of left-wing bias but last month Strache stepped up his criticism, pledging to scrap the license fee that funds ORF and force it to report ""objectively"". 
He also posted a picture on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) of news anchor Armin Wolf with the inscription: ""There is a place where lies become news. That place is ORF.""
President Alexander Van der Bellen has condemned the posting as unbefitting Austrian democracy. 
In an interview with tabloid newspaper Oesterreich's online news channel on Wednesday, Strache said: ""It would have been better if I had not done it."" 
But he added he stood by his fundamental criticism of ORF.
Wolf has filed a defamation suit with a criminal court in Vienna, saying no politician has accused him of lying before. The court has found there is a case to answer.
Strache has offered to settle the case out of court and apologize publicly but Wolf has declined. Strache has repeatedly defended the posting as a Mardi Gras prank since it included the one-word caption ""Satire!"" 
Strache repeated that defense on Wednesday, and also unexpectedly heaped praise on Wolf, who is known for his muscular interviewing style.
""I also hold Armin Wolf in high regard ... Every interview with him is a delight,"" Strache said, adding: ""He treats everyone relatively equally and fairly and objectively.""
He did not comment directly on the civil case that ORF filed against him after Wolf's -- an unprecedented move in Austria's post-war democracy.
While Strache said some of ORF's journalists were ""excellent"", he said he still wanted to scrap the license fee and replace it with direct funding from the government that would come with ""efficiency"" requirements.

Asked if he wanted a referendum on the license fee, Strache said: ""That is my wish."" He added, however, that much would depend on Kurz's party, which has said little about its plans.

The allegations around Zuma, who was forced out of office last month by his ruling African National Congress (ANC) party, and the wealthy Gupta family have tarred major companies, among them, KPMG and McKinsey, and triggered the revolt against Zuma.
Zuma and the Guptas, who are Indian nationals, have consistently denied wrongdoing.
Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo said in a televised news briefing that the investigative commission had started preliminary work on March 1. It lead investigator will be a former auditor-general, Terrence Nombembe.
The commission will be able to make recommendations for prosecutions.
The commission stems from a 2016 anti-graft report by the Public Protector, a regulatory office with a robust constitutional mandate, that called for an investigation into what is known in South Africa as ""state capture.""
It focused on allegations that the brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta had influenced the appointment of ministers.

Saudi Arabia does not recognize Israel and lifting the airspace ban would reflect what appears to be thawing ties between Israel and the kingdom, both U.S. allies with a shared concern over Iranian influence in the region.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that Saudi Arabia had granted Air India permission to fly over its territory on its new routes to and from Tel Aviv, but there was no confirmation from either Saudi Arabia or Air India.
Air India plans to operate flights three days a week, and the flight would save two hours of travel time as a result of flying over the Saudi airspace, an Air India spokesman said.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi said on Wednesday his party would back the far-right League in attempts to form a government, as an anti-establishment rival reaffirmed its claim to call the shots in any new coalition.
No party or bloc won an absolute majority in Sunday's national election, leaving the country mired in political uncertainty as EU authorities said urgent action was needed to put its teetering economy back on an even keel.
An alliance of center-right and far-right groups won the most parliamentary seats, with the euroskeptic, anti-migrant, League for the first time gaining more votes than Berlusconi's more moderate Forza Italia (Go Italy!).
The octogenarian media magnate insisted his allies be given first chance to govern, while acknowledging that Forza Italia was no longer the kingpin on the right. 
""In full respect of our agreements, we will now loyally support attempts by (League leader Matteo) Salvini to form a government,"" Berlusconi told Corriere della Sera.
""I am here to support him, to guarantee the solidity of the coalition and keep our commitments with the voters.""
The anti-system 5-Star movement established itself as by far the most popular party, however, and its leader staked a fresh claim to take the helm of the country.
Luigi Di Maio laid out on Wednesday key themes the next government needed to focus on -- reducing poverty and unemployment, cutting wasteful state spending, lowering taxes for businesses and boosting security.
""Politics must stop being arrogant and start to be humble,"" Di Maio wrote in la Repubblica newspaper. ""The importance of this vote is enormous and marks a sea change with everything that has gone before.""
ECONOMIC IMBALANCES
An opinion poll published by La7 television said 40 percent of people wanted Di Maio to be entrusted by the head of state with forming a new government. Only 21 percent backed Salvini.
President Sergio Mattarella is not expected to start formal government consultations until next month.
Meanwhile in Brussels, the European Commission said Italy, with its large debt and weak banking sector, was among three EU states experiencing ""excessive"" economic imbalances that might impinge on other parts of the bloc.
As part of regular monitoring of European economies, the Commission welcomed reform efforts, especially in the banking sector, by Italy's outgoing, centre-left government 
But, without commenting directly on Sunday's election or its outcome, the EU executive noted in its report that ""reform momentum has somehow slowed"".
Both the League and 5-Star promoted free-spending policies on the campaign trail, and concerns that they might loosen the domestic purse strings if they took office drove a sell-off of Italian assets on Monday.
The position of the defeated Democratic Party (PD), which led the outgoing government, could yet prove pivotal because it will have numbers in the new parliament to become prospective kingmaker for either the right or 5-Star.
PD leader Matteo Renzi has said he will resign but has also sought to lay down his party's future path - saying it would move into opposition and shun any tie-ups with either party.
Some PD heavyweights bristled at this and said the party should be open to talks with 5-Star, which managed to whisk away many former centre-left voters thanks to its focus on helping the poor and the unemployed.
But many ordinary PD voters have taken to social media to mobilize against such an alliance, using the hashtag #withoutme.
Industry Minister Carlo Calenda, who announced on Tuesday that he would join the PD, also came out against any pact with the 5-Star, which has accused the centre-left of being corrupt and incompetent.
In the event of such an alliance ""my membership of the party will be the shortest in the history of party politics,"" he wrote on Twitter.
Full results of the election have still not been released because of legal disputes in the Lazio region centered on Rome.
But projections by YouTrend pollsters say the center-right will take 267 seats in the lower house, 49 short of a majority, while 5-Star will have some 228. 

The PD was seen taking 109 seats against the 292 it won at the last election in 2013.

The individuals were members of the ""Freital Group"", named after their base in the state of Saxony, a bastion of support for the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD), which won the most votes there in a Sept. 24 federal election. 
After a year-long trial, Dresden's high court sentenced seven members of the group to between five and 10 years behind bars. The eighth got a youth sentence of four years, a spokeswoman said. 
At least some of the defendants have appeared in court covering their faces with hoodies during their trial. 
Prosecutors accused the group of being driven by xenophobic, radical right-wing views and a Nazi ideology and of wanting to create a climate of fear that would drive out foreigners.
The charges against them included belonging to a terrorist organization, attempted murder, setting off explosives, grievous bodily harm, attempted grievous bodily harm and damage to property.
In one of the attacks cited by prosecutors, the suspects detonated explosives next to windows at a refugee shelter, knowing there were people inside. One resident suffered cuts but prosecutors argued it was luck that no one was seriously hurt or even killed.
The suspects also set off explosives on a car belonging to a local politician from the radical Left party. 
The prosecutors say the group targeted refugees, aid workers and leftist politicians and acquired in the Czech Republic large quantities of explosives that are illegal in Germany. 
The defendants have confessed to their roles in the individual crimes but their lawyer had rejected the accusation of being part of a terrorist group and of attempted murder.
The group's attacks were part of a wave of right-wing violence against refugees triggered by the arrival of more than 1 million migrants in Germany since 2014.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Syrian refugees and German politicians condemned on Wednesday a visit to Damascus by members of an anti-immigrant party, saying their depictions of life in the city as ""normal"" were especially offensive when a rebel-held enclave nearby was being bombarded.
Seven members of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) are currently on a ""fact-finding"" trip to Syria, which the party wants classified as a safe-country of origin. This would make it easier to deport failed asylum seekers from Germany.
Syrians in Germany have been particularly angered by posts on the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page of Christian Blex, a regional AfD lawmaker, who wrote that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad wanted the 600,000 Syrians who have sought refuge in Germany to return.
Blex also wrote: ""You hardly see any military. There are adverts for mobile phones and televisions. Normal life.""
The comments came as Syrian government forces continued to pound eastern Ghouta, an opposition-held enclave on the outskirts of Damascus where hundreds of civilians have been killed in a two-week bombing campaign.
""Were you also able to travel to (eastern) Ghouta?,"" Fadi Brimo, a Syrian refugee living in Dortmund, asked Blex. ""You know what? You are sick.""
Mohamad Fakhri Kaake, a Syrian based in Stuttgart, wrote: ""If you were serious you would have gone to Ghouta, Homs or Idlib and asked people there what they think. You know what they think, but you have no interest in the truth.""
Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman slammed the visit.
""Those who flatter this regime disqualify themselves,"" Steffen Seibert told a regular news conference. ""The Syrian regime shows every day how inhumanly it treats its own people.""
A spokesman for the AfD said the visit was private and did not represent the AfD's parliamentary group in the Bundestag lower house, though it included some Bundestag deputies.
The AfD swept into the Bundestag in last September's election on a wave of public concern over Merkel's decision in 2015 to let in more than a million asylum seekers, many of them from Syria.
The AfD says Islam is incompatible with the German constitution, wants to repatriate Syrian refugees and says German media coverage of the war that has killed hundreds of thousands and forced millions to leave their homes cannot be trusted as most outlets are leftist.
""TERROR MUFTI""
The mass-selling Bild newspaper criticized the AfD delegation's meeting in Damascus with Syria's Grand Mufti, Ahmed Badr al-Din Hassoun, who in 2011 threatened Europe and the United States with suicide bombers if they attacked Syria.
Bild labeled Hassoun a ""terror Mufti"" in an article that featured a picture of two Syrian boys who survived a chlorine gas attack in Ghouta on Monday blamed on Syrian government forces. Damascus denies using chemical weapons. 
A spokesman for Germany's ecologist Greens called on the Federal Prosecutor's Office (GBA) to weigh launching an investigation into the AfD lawmakers' meeting with Hassoun, saying it could possibly amount to ""abetting terrorism"".
One Syrian opposition activist who was once jailed by Assad and then fled to Germany shortly before the uprising began in 2011 said the visit demonstrated close links between the AfD and Russia, which is providing military support to Damascus.
""What is surprising is their meeting with Hassoun. In Europe they are fighting Islam because they see it as a threat, but in Syria they have no problem meeting the man who threatened to send them suicide bombers,"" said Hozan Ibrahim.

Members of the AfD earlier this year visited Ukraine's Crimea region, which Russia annexed in 2014. The party denies receiving any funding from Russia.

YANGON (Reuters) - Police in Myanmar searched the family home of Reuters reporter Wa Lone looking for material ""related to news"" the night after he and a colleague were arrested on suspicion of violating the Official Secrets Act, an officer told a court on Wednesday.
Myanmar has previously denied accusations Wa Lone, 31, and fellow Reuters journalist Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, were targeted over their reporting of a crisis in northern Rakhine state.
Court proceedings are under way in Yangon to decide if they will faces charges under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.
Before Wednesday's hearing a doctor examined and took blood samples from the pair at the request of the defense, after their lawyer raised concerns that their health had deteriorated in prison. Both have been in custody since their arrest on Dec. 12.
Prosecution witness Police Major Soe Aung told the court he had been sent to search Wa Lone's family home in northern Yangon on the evening of Dec. 13. 
Asked during cross-examination what police were looking for, he said the 10 or so police officers who entered the house were ""searching in relation to news"". He did not elaborate.
INVESTIGATION INTO KILLINGS
The reporters had been working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men who were buried in a mass grave in northern Rakhine state after being hacked to death or shot by ethnic Rakhine Buddhist villagers and soldiers.
The military excavated the shallow grave in December, days after Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested, saying they had received a tip-off. Authorities are taking action against 10 members of the security forces and six villagers, according to a government spokesman.
""Police went my home to search about Rakhine and what we were reporting, and they surely aimed to sue us to stop our reporting,"" Wa Lone told reporters during a break.
Myanmar's ambassador to the United Nations, Hau Do Suan, said last month that the journalists were not arrested for reporting a story, but were accused of ""illegally possessing confidential government documents"". 
The government prosecutor, Kyaw Min Aung, did not respond to a Reuters reporter who attempted to ask him about the case after the hearing on Wednesday. Government spokespeople have declined to comment on the case, citing the ongoing court proceedings. 
Soe Aung testified that during the search police found a reporters' notebook from the Myanmar Times, where Wa Lone had worked prior to joining Reuters in 2016, that included the phone number of a leader of an ethnic Rakhine armed group, which was recorded on a police search form at the time of the search.
Police also seized a broken laptop, a hard drive belonging to Wa Lone's younger brother, and an empty bag during the search, according to the police form and Wa Lone's family.
RESTAURANT MEETING
The reporters have said that they had been invited to meet two police officers at a northern Yangon restaurant on Dec. 12, and were arrested almost immediately after being handed rolled up papers by the policemen, whom they had not met before.
Police officers have testified in court, however, that they were arrested after they were stopped and searched at a traffic checkpoint by officers who were unaware they were journalists.
Also on Wednesday, Kyaw Min, a 21-year-old waiter from the restaurant where the reporters met the two police, told the court he could not remember seeing Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo.
Kyaw Min was the second member of the restaurant's staff called to testify by prosecutors to say they had no knowledge of the arrest. He repeatedly told the court he could not remember details of the night of Dec. 12. 
Asked why he was a witness in the case, Kyaw Min said he had come forward to make a statement after being told his restaurant was mentioned in a newspaper article about the case.
The hearing was adjourned until March 14.

The Saudi prince also accused Turkey of trying to reinstate the Islamic Caliphate, abolished nearly a century ago when the Ottoman Empire collapsed.
His reported comments reflect Saudi Arabia's deep suspicion of President Tayyip Erdogan, whose ruling AK Party has its roots in Islamist politics and who has allied his country with Qatar in its dispute with Saudi Arabia and some other Gulf states.
Turkey has also worked with Iran, Saudi Arabia's arch-rival in the Middle East, to try to reduce fighting in northern Syria in recent months, and Iranian and Turkish military chiefs exchanged visits last year.
Al-Shorouk quoted Prince Mohammed as saying ""the contemporary triangle of evil comprises Iran, Turkey and extremist religious groups.""
The prince spoke to Egyptian newspaper editors during a visit to Cairo, on his first foreign trip since becoming heir to the oil exporting giant last year.
He said the dispute with Qatar could be long-lasting, comparing it to the U.S. embargo of Cuba imposed 60 years ago, but played down its impact, dismissing the Gulf emirate as ""smaller than a Cairo street"".
Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain cut diplomatic and trade links with Qatar last June, suspending air and shipping routes with the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, which is home to the region’s biggest U.S. military base.

GAZA (Reuters) - Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are planning a six-week-long tent city protest near the Israeli border starting on March 30 to demand Palestinian refugees be allowed to return to what is now Israel, organizers said on Wednesday.
Such a demonstration, envisaging families camped out in the sensitive border area, could present a dilemma for the Israeli military that enforces a ""no go"" zone for Palestinians on land adjacent to Israel's frontier fence.
Israeli soldiers are confronted by frequent violent Palestinian protests along the Gaza border and have used tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition against demonstrators whom the military said hurled rocks or petrol bombs at them.
Ahmed Abu Ayesh, a spokesman for a coordinating committee, said plans were for hundreds or thousands of people, including entire families, to live in tents erected ""at the nearest, safe point from the border"". The United Nations, Abu Ayesh said, would be notified of the rally.
A statement issued by the committee urged Palestinians in Gaza to take part in this ""national project that endorses peaceful resistance as a new way to win our rights, foremost the right of return"" of refugees to what is now Israel.
The protest is set to begin on March 30, the annual ""Land Day"" commemorating the six Arab citizens of Israel who were killed by Israeli security forces during demonstrations in 1976 over government land confiscations in northern Israel.
It will end, the organizers said, on May 15, the day Palestinians call the ""Nakba"" or ""catastrophe"", marking the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in the conflict surrounding the creation of Israel in 1948.
Organizers said the protest is supported by several Palestinian factions, including Gaza's dominant Hamas group that is dedicated to Israel's destruction. The factions, the organizers added, would have no formal presence at the venue, where portable toilets and food would be supplied.
In the town of Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, a Palestinian journalist got a jump-start on the protest, erecting two tents about 450 meters (yards) from the border fence, to promote the planned demonstration.
""I admired the idea,"" Muthana an-Najar told Reuters, predicting that Israeli forces ""will be confused about how to handle"" the protest.
Among several disputes that have deadlocked Middle East peace talks has been the Palestinians' demand that as many as five million of their compatriots be granted the right to return to lands in Israel that they or their kin lost.
Israel rules this out, fearing an influx of Arabs that would eliminate its Jewish majority, and argues the refugees should resettle in a future Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, territories it occupied in the 1967 war. Israel pulled its troops and settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005.

The Special Tribunal for Lebanon also said that evidence presented by prosecutors ""could"" lead to the convictions of four suspects. That means lawyers for the four, who remain at large and are being tried in absentia, must present their defenses.
Prosecutors rested their case last month. Lawyers for one of the suspects, Hussein Hassan Oneissi, had asked for early acquittal, saying all evidence against him was circumstantial.
But Judge Janet Nosworthy said that evidence, including cell phone records presented by prosecutors, showed Oneissi may have been involved in an elaborate attempt to blame the attack on a fictional terrorist group.
It also could imply he knew the attack itself was being prepared.
""The trial chamber has sufficient evidence from which it could convict Mr. Oneissi of his involvement in the attack on Mr. Hariri,"" she said.
The court ordered an organizational meeting with all defense lawyers for Thursday, 8 March.
Judges underlined that they have not concluded any of the suspects are actually guilty, only that they have a case to answer.
Defence lawyers for the other suspects, Salim Jamil Ayyash, Hassan Habib Merhi and Assad Hassan Sabra, did not seek early acquittal.
Elsewhere in the decision, Presiding Judge David Re said the attack, which killed Hariri and 21 others, was an act of terrorism, intended to sow fear among the Lebanese people, and could only have been carried out by a sophisticated group, with intricate planning over a long period of time.

Angola's government forced 530 Congolese to return to Congo between Feb. 25 and 27, UNHCR said in a statement on Tuesday.
Of those sent back, 480 were unregistered refugees staying at the Cacanda center managed by aid agencies in the frontier town of Dundo, the statement said.
""Continuing instability poses a grave risk to civilian safety, including for several hundred refugees recently returned there from Angola,"" it said. ""UNHCR urges the Angolan authorities to refrain from further forcible returns of Congolese."" 
Angola's Ministry for Social Assistance and Integration, which manages refugees, did not respond to a request for comment.
Nearly a million people have been forced to flee their homes in Kasai since the second half of 2016 due to a vicious cycle of inter-ethnic violence, anti-government fighting and a crackdown by the army.
The bloodshed has seen 35,000 refugees cross Congo's southern border into Angola, seeking safety in and around Dundo.
Some have been moved to a settlement outside Dundo but many live with relatives or friends in the town itself, complicating official registration by international agencies.
Angola has publicly offered to help by providing land to host the refugees.
However, the country has also long been nervous about security on its northern border and the risk of illegal immigrants crossing into Angola, many of whom seek to work in artisanal diamond mines along the province’s rivers.
Angola has greatly increased its military and police presence in the area since the violence in Kasai broke out and has put pressure on DRC to resolve the situation.

FREETOWN, March 7 (Reuters) - Sierra Leone voters queued for hours in steamy humidity on Wednesday to elect a new leader they hope will end years of economic crisis caused by twin shocks of a commodities slump and an Ebola epidemic.
President Ernest Bai Koroma is stepping aside, having completed his maximum two terms in office, and sixteen candidates are vying to replace him, of whom four are seen as having a realistic chance.
Adama Sesay, a widow with six children, was so anxious to get to the polling station that she left her house at five.
""I am a single parent and things are not easy for me economically so I'm waiting in line to cast my vote for the future,"" she told Reuters at a polling station in Waterloo, a village nestled in palm trees and forest on the outskirts of the West African country's capital. 
""In Sierra Leone we are far behind some other countries in Africa, which are making progress,"" Sesay said.
The Ebola crisis starting in 2014 and the global commodities downturn dragged Sierra Leone's economy into the doldrums. It shrank by a fifth in 2015, after years of double-digit growth during its rebound from a ruinous 1990s civil war in which child soldiers fought and tens of thousands died.
Since then, growth has been sluggish and many hope Koroma's 10-year stint will be followed by a leader who can do more to improve the lives of citizens on the poverty line. Despite those frustrations, and the long waits, voting went ahead peacefully. 
""I see out there people responding to calls we have made, people behaving in a manner that is democratic and I see our people are transforming the country,"" Koroma said, casting his vote in Freetown's Goderich district. 
""Sierra Leone has matured, which gives me a sense of satisfaction ... that (it) is on the path of development.""
Politics has been dominated by two ruling parties since independence from Britain in 1961: the ruling All People's Congress, now fielding ex-foreign minister Samura Kamara, and the Sierra Leone People's Party behind Julius Maada Bio, who briefly ruled as head of a military junta in 1996.

But two candidates from younger parties - former United Nations Under-Secretary Kandeh Yumkella and Samuel Sam-Sumana - are seen as having a strong chance if they can garner enough votes from disaffected younger people tired of the status quo.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel and Egypt were working to halt disruptions to mobile phone service after Egyptian jamming against Sinai insurgents caused outages in neighboring Israel and the Gaza Strip, Israeli officials said on Wednesday.
Under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Egypt has quietly cooperated with Israel on security in the Sinai, a desert peninsula demilitarized as part of their U.S.-sponsored 1979 peace treaty but where Cairo's forces now operate freely.
The jamming appeared to catch Israel by surprise, however, prompting what its communications minister said were talks across the border to resolve what he called a ""crisis"".
Egypt's military did not immediately comment. 
Cairo launched a major sweep of Sinai jihadis loyal to Islamic State on Feb 9. Israeli officials said that on Feb 21 Egyptian forces began jamming a range of cellphone frequencies in Sinai, disrupting reception in Israel and Gaza.
""We've never seen anything this intensive or protracted. Even the Palestinians have been coming to us, appealing to make it stop,"" one Israeli official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Phones had been disrupted as far away as Jerusalem and northern Israel, depending on weather, the official said.
An Egyptian official who also asked not to be identified confirmed electronic warfare was being waged in the Sinai. ""Obviously, we want to stop terrorists from communicating,"" he told Reuters.
The official denied that Israel was the intended target of the jamming, but he said some Sinai insurgents were suspected of using smuggled Israeli SIM cards, close enough to the border to link up with Israeli cellphone reception, ""which means that we may need to work against a wide range of frequencies"".
Several Palestinian residents of Gaza, the densely populated enclave on the Egyptian border, told Reuters they had been experiencing problems with phone service.
A source at one of the two Palestinian mobile phone companies said its services were disrupted for a day in the past week in southern Gaza but that the problem had been resolved.
Israeli cellphone provider Partner said several hundred of its customers had complained about reception problems, but that its 4G network was working well. Other leading Israeli providers, Cellcom and Pelephone, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Interviewed by Israel's Army Radio, Communications Minister Ayoob Kara said: ""Without getting into details, for the first time in the south we have been experiencing an uncomfortable situation"".
But he said understandings were reached ""after a very important meeting across the border"" on Tuesday, and he believed the disruptions would end within the next three days.
Gadi Yarkoni, a mayor representing Israeli communities near Gaza, criticized the Communications Ministry and threatened to sue the phone companies, saying the failure to fix disruptions ""shows disrespect for the residents of the Gaza periphery"".

The Multinational Force & Observers (MFO), an international body set up under the Israel-Egypt peace agreement to monitor the Sinai, declined to comment.

In an annual report to the U.N. Human Rights Council, High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein also took democracies to task for failing to respect basic rights. 
""In the United States, I am shocked by reports that many migrants intercepted at the southern borders, including children, are detained in abusive conditions – such as freezing temperatures – and that some young children are being detained separately from their families,"" he said. 
""Detentions and deportations of long-standing and law-abiding migrants have sharply increased, tearing families apart and creating enormous hardship.""
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump had also ended the Central American Minors Refugee and Parole Programme, which offered adolescents and children ""a lifeline to safety"", and ended Temporary Protected Status for hundreds of thousands of people.
""I deplore the continuing uncertainty about beneficiaries of the DACA program,"" Zeid said, referring to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which protects roughly 700,000 ""Dreamers"" - mostly young Hispanics - from deportation and lets them work.
The protections are due to start phasing out in March under Trump's move to end DACA, but Congress so far has failed to pass legislation to address the fate of the ""Dreamers"".
Zeid also expressed concern about U.S. proposals that could ""drastically reduce social protections"", particularly for poorer Americans.
In many European Union (EU) countries the trend towards ""racism, xenophobia and incitement to hatred"" was now dominating the political landscape, as shown in Italy's recent election campaign, he said. 
""I am deeply concerned about the current overriding focus of EU States on preventing migrants from reaching Europe, and rushing to deport many who do,"" Zeid added.
By pushing migrants back from its borders, the EU risked ""subcontracting their protection"" to states such as Libya, where they faced a real risk of torture, sexual violence and other serious violations, he said.
He attacked Austria's planned crackdown on Muslim schools and mosques and expulsions of irregular migrants, and Hungary's plans to restrict non-profits that sought to help migrants.
He decried discrimination against the Roma minority in the Czech Republic and its program of surgically castrating sex offenders. 

""I am disturbed... by the extraordinary recent legislation which could lead to up to three years’ imprisonment for those who refer to the Nazi concentration camps in Poland as 'Polish',"" Zeid told the Council.

The government in January proposed holding a referendum to liberalize the abortion regime at the end of May, offering voters the first opportunity in 35 years to overhaul some of the world's strictest laws on the issue.
Before finalizing the exact wording and date of the referendum, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar had said it was prudent to wait for the Supreme Court judgment in a case the state was appealing.
The initial judgment related to an immigration case where a Nigerian man sought to revoke a 2008 deportation order in proceedings initiated eight years later on the basis that his Irish partner was at that time pregnant with their child.
The High Court ruled that the unborn enjoyed rights beyond the right to life set out in the eighth amendment that voters are due to be asked if they wish to repeal in the proposed referendum.
The state appealed the ruling, arguing the only right the unborn have is the right to be born and all other constitutional rights take effect at birth.

Ireland's cabinet is due to meet on Thursday to discuss the ruling.

1642,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 01:31AM ET</span>","India, with eye on China ties, bans Tibetans rally in New Delhi","By Rupam Jain
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has banned Tibetans from holding a rally with the Dalai Lama in New Delhi this month to mark the 60th anniversary of a failed uprising against Chinese rule, officials said on Wednesday, as it tries to improve fraught ties with China.
Relations between China and India have been tense in recent months after their troops faced off on a disputed part of their border. China was also angered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's February visit to the eastern border state of Arunachal Pradesh, also claimed by China.
Senior officials in the foreign and interior ministries said exiled Tibetans would not be allowed to hold a rally in the capital, but could do so in the northern town of Dharamsala, where a Tibetan government in exile is based.
""We don't want Tibetans to hold big anti-China protests in New Delhi because it creates a bit of diplomatic tension between India and China,"" said the senior foreign ministry official.
""It's a very sensitive time for India and China ties and we want to ease tensions.""
China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a news briefing on Thursday that there was a ""pressing need"" for China and India to resolve a lack of mutual trust.
Authorities in India and Nepal have previously banned protests against China by Tibetans during sensitive times, such as visits by Chinese leaders.
China took control of Tibet in 1950 in what it calls a ""peaceful liberation"" of the remote, Himalayan region.
An uprising against Chinese rule in Tibet erupted in 1958 and troops crushed it the following year. The Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, fled from the crackdown and was granted asylum in India.
The Dalai Lama has lived mostly in Dharamsala, where his supporters run a small government in exile and advocate for autonomy for Tibet by peaceful means.
An interior ministry also said the Tibetan rally could not be held in New Delhi.
""The Dalai Lama's followers can host events, hold protests - but only in Dharamsala,"" said the official, who also declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media.
""We have limited them this time.""
Dorje Gyalchen, a representative of the Tibetan community in Dharamsala, confirmed that the venue for the gathering planned for New Delhi would be changed.
China considers the Dalai Lama to be a dangerous separatist and has piled pressure on foreign governments to shun him. India allows him to pursue his religious activities in the country and to travel abroad. 
Tens of thousands Tibetans live in 39 formal settlements and dozens of informal communities across India. 
Rights groups say the Chinese government tramples on Tibet's religious and cultural traditions, charges Beijing denies.
A Tibetan man in his forties died on Thursday after setting himself on fire in Ngawa county in southeastern China's Sichuan province, according to advocacy group the International Campaign for Tibet.
Reuters was unable to independently confirm the group's account. The Ngawa government did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. 
The apparent self-immolation, which came as the annual meeting of China's parliament is underway in Beijing and just prior to an anniversary of a Tibetan uprising on March 10, 1959.
Rights groups say there have been about 150 self-immolations by Tibetans in China since 2009, with the last reported case in December 2017.

1643,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>",Burkina authorities arrest eight in connection with deadly attack,"OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - Eight people including two Burkinabe soldiers have been arrested in connection with an attack by Islamist militants that killed eight security agents in Burkina Faso's capital on Friday, the country's prosecutor said. 
A Mali-based al Qaeda affiliate called Jama'a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM) claimed responsibility for the assault on the French embassy and the army headquarters in Ouagadougou in which eight gunmen were also killed and over 80 people were wounded.
Investigators suspect the attackers received inside help when they targeted a room where leading army officials were supposed to be having a meeting. 
""An ex-soldier and two others still on duty are among those arrested by investigators,"" prosecutor Maizan Sereme told reporters late on Tuesday. She added that more than 60 victims and witnesses had been questioned. 
The carefully planned assault, in which attackers were able to force their way into the army headquarters using rifles, grenades and explosives just after 10 a.m. on Friday, highlighted the precarious security situation across the remote, arid Sahel region where Islamist insurgents operate across borders without detection. 
One militant blew himself up inside the army compound during clashes that killed six soldiers and two gendarmes were killed at the embassy. In all, over 60 vehicles and motorcycles were burned and over 80 others were damaged, Sereme said.
Previous high-profile attacks in Ouagadougou and near Burkina Faso's porous border with Mali were also conducted by allies of al Qaeda in reprisal for Burkina Faso's participation in a regional fight against the militants.
Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) claimed responsibility for attacks on a restaurant and hotel in Ouagadougou in January 2016 in which 30 people were killed. AQIM merged with other local jihadist groups last year to form JNIM.

The defense bill, which must still be approved by the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, would raise the number of German troops deployed in Afghanistan by a third to 1,300.
It also changes Germany's military operations in Iraq. After their successful work training Kurdish Peshmerga forces in north, German forces would now also be stationed in Baghdad.
The cabinet's decision implements an agreement on defense made by Merkel's conservatives and the center-left SPD during negotiations about a re-run of the 'grand coalition' that ruled Germany since 2013. 
It also includes a plan to add 100 more troops to Germany's 1,000-strong deployment to a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mali in order to meet increased maintenance needs and Germany's new responsibility for a military base in Gao.
The decision to increase German military presence in Afghanistan comes against a backdrop of increased violence there and a new peace initiative launched by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.
Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen told broadcaster ARD the move should be matched with accelerated reforms by Kabul. She warned the mission would likely extend for some time.
""We need patience and a long breath, without question,"" von der Leyen told ARD, citing a history of progress and setbacks in Afghanistan in recent years.
She praised the military's success in training the Peshmerga, adding, ""That is moving to a different level now,"" von der Leyen said.
In addition, the cabinet backed the continuation of surveillance and refueling flights by the German military in support of allied efforts to fight Islamic State, as well as AWACs flights carried out on behalf of NATO.
Germany has carried out limited engagements abroad since World War Two, focusing mainly on training , surveillance, medical rescue and peacekeeping, although it participated in the 1999 air offensive on what was then Yugoslavia.
The minister acknowledged shortfalls in military equipment and personnel disclosed in a critical report last week, but said troops headed on overseas missions like those in Iraq and Afghanistan would be adequately equipped.
The new governing coalition has already agreed to add 10 billion euros to the military budget over the next four years, but von der Leyen has said further increases will be needed to rebuild the German military after years of spending cuts.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The second winter storm within a week crept into New York and surrounding states on Wednesday, with forecasters predicting intensifying snowfall that could snarl the evening rush hour as thousands remained without power from the last nor'easter.
Between 8 and 12 inches (20 and 30 cm) of wet, heavy snow, some of it accompanied by thunder and lightning, were forecast for New York City and the surrounding suburbs in New Jersey and Connecticut through to Thursday morning. Wind gusts could create ""near-whiteout conditions"" for commuters, the National Weather Service said.
The service bumped up its snowfall estimates on Wednesday morning, with up to 2 feet (60 cm) expected in some inland parts of New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts. 
The storm will spread with varying degrees of intensity across the Northeast, from western Pennsylvania up into New England, and officials took precautions. 
Around half of all scheduled flights were canceled at the three major airports serving New York City, according to the tracking service FlightAware.
All schools were closed in Philadelphia while schools across the region canceled classes or shortened the school day ahead of the storm, local news media reported. Schools stayed open in New York City.
Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy ordered many state workers to head home early on Wednesday afternoon at staggered intervals to avoid traffic snarls on slippery roads.
This week's storm was not forecast to have the hurricane-strength winds whipped up at times by the storm last week, but forecasters say strong gusts of 60 miles per hour (96.56 km per hour) and accumulated snow will still be enough to knock down more power lines. 
Some 100,000 homes and businesses in the region remained without power on Wednesday. 
The governors of New Jersey and Pennsylvania declared states of emergency, giving them access to support from the U.S. government if needed. 
The Amtrak passenger train service canceled some Wednesday trains between Washington and Boston, as well as some services in Pennsylvania and other parts of the Northeast.
The storm got off to a slow, drizzly start in New York City, with Michelle Boone, 50, not even bothering to unfurl her umbrella as she waited for a bus to her job at a Manhattan homeless shelter.
""This evening could be different, though,"" she said, saying she was prepared for a tougher slog home.

By lunchtime, the snowfall had quickened and thickened, and the umbrellas were out.

Le Pen emerged politically wounded from last year's presidential election and both she and her party have been searching for relevance since, after the political landscape was upended by President Emmanuel Macron.
Asked by Kantar-Sofres-Onepoint pollsters if Le Pen would make a good national leader, 73 percent of respondents said no. More than half said she was incapable of uniting her divided camp and that the National Front would never win power.
Le Pen has been at the helm of the party since 2011, delivering more success than her father and party founder Jean-Marie Le Pen ever managed by making it more palatable to mainstream voters and winning local and European elections.
But her fiery anti-euro stance hurt her in a country where there is still broad support for Europe's single currency and membership of the European Union. 
Her shift to make immigration the main policy focus reflects successes enjoyed by far-right parties in The Netherlands, Austria, Germany and most recently Italy, where anti-immigration policies have been championed.
Le Pen has been squeezed on the right of French politics by Laurent Wauquiez, the new leader of the mainstream The Republicans party, who has taken it further to the right and made overtures to National Front sympathisers.
Le Pen will gather the National Front for a full party congress on March 10-11 in Lille, when she will formalize the policy shift and unveil a new name for the party, an attempt to move away from the negative associations of the National Front, including accusations of anti-Semitism and homophobia.

It is not clear what new names she is considering.

DANANG, Vietnam (Reuters) - Sailors from a U.S. aircraft carrier on Wednesday visited a Vietnamese shelter for people suffering from the effects of Agent Orange, a chemical used by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War to destroy foliage.
Of the 4.8 million people who were exposed to Agent Orange, some three million are still suffering from its effects, including children born with severe disabilities or other health issues years after their parents were exposed, according to the Hanoi-based Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange.
""I think it's very powerful to see the circumstances in which we're here today compared to, say, 40 years ago,"" said Gordon Watkins, a sailor from the visiting USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier who was at the shelter in Danang.
""I'm here in a T-shirt and shorts, and I'm playing with children,"" said Watkins, who was holding a young Vietnamese boy in his arms. 
""I think that's a really good step,"" said Watkins, who along with other sailors made incense sticks and plastic flowers with the children at the shelter.
The Vinson arrived in Vietnam on Monday in the first visit of a U.S. aircraft carrier since the war ended in 1975, dramatically underscoring the growing strategic ties between the two former foes at a time when China's regional influence is rising.
On Tuesday, a U.S. Navy band visiting Vietnam with the carrier performed a rendition of ""Noi Vong Tay Lon"", a Vietnamese song about national unity which was popular during the war.
The United States will soon finish a five-year, $110 million program designed to clean soil contaminated by Agent Orange at Danang International Airport. 
And in January, the two countries said they would begin the process of decontaminating an area of Bien Hoa Air Base in Southern Vietnam where much of the Agent Orange used during the war was stored by the U.S. military.
That clean-up operation will cost $500 million and last ten years, according to USAID.
""We hope this visit is a chance for the American government and companies who produced Agent Orange to understand more about the adverse impacts of the substance on its victims and take responsibility for the harm it has done,"" said Quach Thanh Vinh, of the Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange.

""There is still room for the U.S. government and American people to understand the impact of Agent Orange on Vietnamese people.""

1650,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 05:45AM ET</span>","As talks with North near, South Korea sees familiar hurdles ahead","By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - With the specter of two past summits that failed to blunt North Korea's nuclear ambitions, South Korean officials planning talks next month now face the thorny task of overcoming familiar sticking points with the threat of war looming over any failure.
A South Korean delegation returned home on Tuesday from a first-ever meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, to announce the agreement on a North-South summit next month, the first since 2007.
Seoul officials see the talks as the starting point of President Moon Jae-in's initiative to denuclearize and build lasting peace on the peninsula, beginning with a freeze in the North's nuclear program and ending in its complete abolishment. 
""While pursuing a fundamental resolution of the standoff, we need to take some initial denuclearization steps, putting a halt to further testing and returning to dialogue,"" a senior South Korean government official said on condition of anonymity. 
""One could argue we would be deceived by the North as we have been for the last 20 years, but that's the past - we have different people and different programs now,"" the official said.
Moon said on Wednesday he had suggested to the North a rough roadmap progressing from a nuclear freeze to denuclearization, an opposition party chair told reporters after meeting with him.
But Moon said there won't be ""many agreements"" to come out of the summit, according to a ruling party lawmaker who took part in the meeting. 
Moon also called a 2005 deal of six-nation nuclear talks, under which Pyogyang agreed to give up its nuclear program in return for economic and energy aid and an end to its diplomatic isolation, a ""failed model"", the first politician said. 
FAMILIAR PATTERN
Former officials in Washington and Tokyo reacted with scepticism to the North's offer of talks on denuclearization, seeing a familiar pattern of threats followed by talks that fail to win significant concessions.
Chief among the disagreements that have scuttled past efforts to defuse the standoff is North Korea's requests for security guarantees in return for abandoning its nuclear weapons.
During talks with Moon's envoys this week, the North expressed its willingness to denuclearize if military threats against it are eliminated, and the security of its regime is guaranteed, without presenting precise conditions. 
""(North Korea) has never said what they mean by the guarantee of regime security,"" one former senior South Korean official told Reuters. 
""That means it's up to them to decide whether the security is guaranteed or not, and that means they have full control."" 
Pyongyang has protested South Korea-U.S. joint military drills as a rehearsal of war. 
It has also called the roughly 28,000 American troops stationed in South Korea a potential invasion force that can only be countered by a robust nuclear deterrent.
The North's official KCNA news agency said on Wednesday the United States is ""getting frantic"" with the deployment of U.S. troops on the Korean peninsula and their drills to get ""familiar with its terrain and arms buildup there"".
Moon's special advisor Moon Chung-in has raised the possibility for a possible pullout of U.S. forces, saying the president has the right to ""let them out"". 
Moon declined to comment on the summit, saying: ""We will see.""
SECURITY GUARANTEE?
Any discussion of a U.S. troop withdrawal will be fraught, however, as both Seoul and Washington see them as a bulwark against North Korean provocations.
""For the North, a peace treaty and denuclearization means the removal of U.S. forces from not only the peninsula but also Japan and other bases in the Pacific theater,"" said Kim Young-mok, a former South Korean diplomat who was involved in the making of a 1994 freeze-for-aid framework deal between Pyongyang and Washington. 
""We responded by pledging non-aggression, but I guess it wasn't enough.""
South Korean officials expect the issue to arise again, but are hoping Pyongyang won't make impossible demands.
Another senior official acknowledged the difficulty in making progress in any peace talks without addressing the issue of eliminating the military threat to North Korea and guaranteeing the security of its regime.
""The North bring up disarmament talks and the withdrawal of U.S. forces"", the official said. 
""If they do, things could get ugly quickly despite the summit, and the South Korea-U.S. alliance would face serious problems. But if the North were to move things forward, they would hopefully present something more realistic."" 
Wi Sung-lac, a former South Korean nuclear negotiator, said there needs to be clearer mutual understanding of the definition of denuclearization to facilitate future talks.
""It's unlikely to see any tangible outcome on the nuclear issue before the summit,"" he said.

""The United States and North Korea could sit together at the negotiating table in the meantime, which would provide better optics for the summit but probably not in terms of substance.""

The case, reminiscent of Cold War-style disappearances, angered Berlin and soured relations with Hanoi.
Federal prosecutors in Karlsruhe said they believe the suspect, identified only as Long N.H., helped with the logistics of the kidnapping, such as renting a vehicle that was used. He was arrested in the Czech Republic in August and handed to German authorities and remains in detention.
In January, Thanh was sentenced to life in prison in Vietnam for violating state regulations and embezzlement.

1652,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 05:31AM ET</span>",Indonesian Islamic university bans burqas on campus,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - An Indonesian state Islamic university faced criticism from Muslim groups and activists on Wednesday after it banned female students from wearing full-face veils citing fears over the spread of radical ideology on the campus.
Indonesia is home to the world's largest Muslim population, the majority of whom practice a moderate form of Islam. 
But the country has seen a recent rise in more conservative interpretations of the religion, which many see as a threat to its long-standing reputation for religious tolerance and diversity. 
The State Islamic University (UIN) in Yogyakarta city, on Java island, said it had 41 students using the full veil, or burqa, who would be offered counseling sessions and ultimately be asked to take off the veil if they wanted to graduate.
The Islamic Defenders Front, a conservative group that campaigns against activities it deems un-Islamic, said in a statement the policy ""did not make sense"" and was in conflict with the country's efforts to preserve diversity.
A women's rights activist decried what she described as a limitation on the freedom of women to wear what they want.
""Using full-face veils is a choice and we cannot interfere in their choice and their freedom,"" said the activist, Lathiefah Widuri Retyaningtyas.
University rector Yudian Wahyudi said radicalization, as exemplified by the burqas, undermined learning.
""Female students wearing the burqa, and radical groups, they are disturbing the teaching process,"" Wahyudhi said.
""We are putting moderate Islam forward,"" he said, adding that the policy was a ""preventive action to save the students"". 
Students would be allowed to continue using regular headscarves that do not cover the face, he said.
A recent survey showed that nearly a fifth of high school and university students support the establishment of a caliphate over the current secular government. 

The data has alarmed authorities already struggling to contain the growing influence of both peaceful and militant Islamist groups in the world's third-largest democracy.

1653,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 05:31AM ET</span>","In rare, bold comments, Hong Kong judge chides former leader as 'uncooperative'","HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Hong Kong judge chided a former city leader now embroiled in a corruption case for being uncooperative and misleading the public, in rare, strongly worded comments that also put the city's rich and powerful under the spotlight.
Donald Tsang, the city's second leader after Hong Kong's 1997 handover from British to Chinese rule, is currently on bail pending appeal after being sentenced to 20 months behind bars for misconduct. 
Two jury panels in two trials failed to reach a consensus on a separate, more serious bribery charge.
An independent legal system sits at the core of the wide-ranging autonomy promised to Hong Kong in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that guarantees it freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.
In a judgment issued on Tuesday, High Court Judge Andrew Chan ordered Tsang to pay a third of the prosecution's trial costs of HK$15 million ($1.91 million).
Chan also described Tsang's attitude during investigations into his alleged offences as ""far from co-operative"", even though Tsang had told the public he had given his full co-operation.
""That seems to be very far from the truth,"" Chan wrote, noting that Tsang's attitude had led to ""totally unnecessary costs which the taxpayer had to pay"". 
A spokeswoman for Tsang said he had no comment on the judgment, but that he was discussing whether to appeal against having to pay the legal costs.
Chan also rebuked the involvement of a public relations firm, which he said tried to bring prominent public figures into the courtroom, including the former justice minister and media personalities in an attempt to introduce good character evidence for Tsang to the jury ""through the back door"".
While there was no direct evidence the firm was engaged by Tsang himself, the inference was ""overwhelming"", Chan wrote.
""It came therefore with no surprise that in recent years, when the wealthy and powerful were charged for criminal offences, they tried all kinds of means and ways to list their cases in the High Court before a jury,"" Chan wrote.
He added it was ""undesirable"" for public relations firms to get involved in criminal proceedings as it could be perceived they are seeking to influence the jury.
""It does nothing good to the rule of law in Hong Kong. This serves as a warning to all public relations firm or consultant.""
But some legal experts raised concerns over Chan's judgment.
""He committed a very fundamental and grave error in not allowing Donald Tsang the chance to explain, before he came to a rather serious and negative conclusion,"" said Eric Cheung, a law academic at the University of Hong Kong.
He also said it would be the prosecution, not the defense, which gets to choose the trial venue.
Former Justice Secretary Wong Yan-lung also said in a statement on Wednesday the judgment contained factual inaccuracies because nobody had arranged his court appearance. The decision had been his alone to show support for Tsang. 
Tsang was sentenced in February 2017 after a jury found him guilty of a charge of misconduct in public office. 
He had deliberately concealed private rental negotiations with a property tycoon while his cabinet approved a broadcasting license for a now defunct radio company that the tycoon partly owned.

WARSAW (Reuters) - A Moroccan man arrested in Sept. 2016 in Poland was connected to Islamic State and attacks in Paris the previous year in which 130 people were killed, Polish prosecutors said on Wednesday.
He was involved with the militant group in 2015 and 2016 and was an informant for Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a coordinator of the November 2015 attack and an assault on a Paris-bound train that August that was thwarted, the National Prosecutor's Office said.
""Photo files with instructions on creating explosive devices (such as) a homemade bomb that could be detonated by using a mobile phone as well as photos of objects on which the explosives were to be used, were discovered on the phone of Mourad T.,"" the office said.
""The investigation has also revealed that the suspect, Mourad T., was a collaborator of ISIS recruiter Abdelhamid Abaaoud,"" it said in a statement.
It did not give the suspect's last name but said he was arrested in the southwestern city of Rybnik on Sept. 5, 2106.
""He has been in a pre-trial detention used as a preventive measure,"" it said.
He participated in a meeting in Turkey's Edirne in December 2014, attended, among others, by Abaaoud and militants killed in January 2015 by Belgian police in Verviers while thwarting an alleged plot. 
The suspect said he was a Syrian refugee and used fake birth information to receive a special identification card in Austria. He came to Poland through the Czech Republic, it said. 
Prosecutors charged him with participation in an armed criminal organization, Islamic State, and he faces up to eight years in prison. He is to be tried in Poland, the statement said.

1657,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 09:22AM ET</span>",'Acts of genocide' suspected against Rohingya in Myanmar: U.N.,"By Stephanie Nebehay and Simon Lewis
GENEVA/YANGON (Reuters) - The United Nations human rights chief said on Wednesday he strongly suspected that ""acts of genocide"" may have taken place against Muslim Rohingyas in Myanmar's northern Rakhine state since August.
His comments come as Myanmar's military published a lengthy response to widespread allegations over its campaign in Rakhine and said its investigations had cleared troops of almost all alleged abuses. 
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said in a speech to the U.N. Human Rights Council that reports of bulldozing of alleged mass graves showed a ""deliberate attempt by the authorities to destroy evidence of potential international crimes, including possible crimes against humanity.""
The United Nations defines genocide as acts meant to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group in whole or in part. Such a designation is rare under international law, but has been used in contexts including Bosnia, Sudan and an Islamic State campaign against the Yazidi communities in Iraq and Syria.
Zeid said last December that Myanmar's security forces may be guilty of committing genocide..
""This Council is aware that my office has strong suspicions that acts of genocide may have taken place in Rakhine State since August,"" he said, noting that his office said on Tuesday that it believes ethnic cleansing is still underway in Rakhine. 
Nearly 700,000 Rohingya have fled Rakhine into Bangladesh since insurgent attacks sparked a security crackdown in August, joining 200,000 refugees from a previous exodus.
Rohingya are still fleeing because of ""systematic"" if lower-intensity persecution and violence there, Zeid said.
""Victims have reported killings, rape, torture and abductions by the security forces and local militia, as well as apparently deliberate attempts to force the Rohingya to leave the area through starvation, with officials blocking their access to crops and food supplies,"" he said. 
The True News Information Team said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post containing the army's position that the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) armed group had ""threatened, coerced and persuaded other villagers to flee to Bangladesh"".
The post addressed a letter last month from British lawmakers to Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson calling for Myanmar to be referred to the International Criminal Court – which it said was based on ""one-sided accusations"" and ignored attacks on civilians by the ARSA - and a European Union decision to prepare sanctions targeted at Myanmar generals.
Zeid said his office had received reports of land inhabited by Rohingya being appropriated and members of other ethnic groups replacing them.
""A recent announcement that seven soldiers and three police officers will be brought to justice for the alleged extra-judicial killing of ten Rohingya men is grossly insufficient,"" he added.
Myanmar's government must take steps to provide real accountability for violations and respect the rights of Rohingya, including to citizenship, Zeid said.

A fact-finding mission set up by the Council, headed by former Indonesian Attorney-General Marzuki Darusman, is due to report on Monday on its initial findings based on interviews with victims and survivors in Bangladesh and other countries.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - With U.S.-Cambodian relations at a low and Chinese influence growing, Washington is trying a new way to win hearts and minds: sponsoring a well-known Cambodian musician to sing positive songs about America.
""When there is tension, countries seek ways to ease it so arts and culture can help,"" said 37-year-old Yorn Young, who launched his ""Lovin' USA"" album in Phnom Penh on Tuesday. He was not worried if people thought it was propaganda, he added.
Yorn Young told Reuters he was getting over $10,000 from the United States for a concert on March 17 in Kampong Thom province, north of the capital. More concerts could follow if it is a success.
Diplomatic ties between the United States and Cambodia have worsened during a crackdown on opponents of authoritarian leader Hun Sen, who has ruled the Southeast Asian country for 33 years and made it one of China's closest regional allies.
The United States scaled back aid after the main opposition leader was arrested and his party banned ahead of an election in July. Planned aid for Cambodia has also been reduced as part of more general cuts under U.S. President Donald Trump. 
Meanwhile, the government accuses the United States of supporting opposition plots to win power.
Yorn Young's music could help improve the relationship, the U.S. embassy said.
""I think it brings us closer together,"" said Cultural Affairs Officer Monica Davis.
Hun Sen often reminds Cambodians about devastating U.S. bombing that began in the late 1960s and a coup by a U.S.-backed general in 1970. Shortly afterwards, U.S. troops invaded from Vietnam and war engulfed the country, leading to the takeover by the genocidal Khmer Rouge in 1975.
Public opinion toward the United States in generally favorable, however. A 2016 survey showed that 85 percent of Cambodians had a positive view of the U.S. impact on the region.
LOST TO CHINA
""From America's perspective, they have lost Cambodia to China. What they continue to possess is the goodwill of the Cambodian people,"" said political commentator Ou Virak.
""In terms of soft power, America is still miles ahead of China ... but China is catching up and the Trump presidency is adding a huge boost to that.""
The songs on the album ""Lovin’ USA: Yorn Young Journey Across America"" are about the beauty of U.S. cities and states that he visited in recent years on trips funded by the U.S. government.
""Cannot believe it's real. Smiling scenery so appealing,"" are the Khmer lyrics of ""Florida, Florida"", sung in a slow and sentimental style.
The United States remained very important to Cambodians, Yorn Young said.
""In Cambodia, people spend U.S. dollars, the internet is American, everything is American,"" said Yorn Young, who has also performed at Cambodian government-sponsored concerts and said he had a good relationship with government officials.
Sok Eysan, a spokesman for the ruling Cambodian People's Party, welcomed the musical initiative as a positive sign - while also condemning the Trump administration's ""support of its puppet, the opposition party"".
The United States has dismissed accusations of American backing for an alleged plot by opposition leader Kem Sokha, who faces treason charges he says were intended to stop him contesting the election.
The White House said last week it was suspending or curtailing several Treasury, USAID and military assistance programs that support Cambodia's military, taxation department and local authorities.
Hun Sen has challenged the United States to cut off aid altogether and pointed to Cambodia's growing help from China.
According to official figures, Cambodia expects more than $260 million from China in bilateral aid in 2018 - more than seven times as much as from the United States. 

Most Chinese aid goes to big projects such as dams, roads and power grids rather than ""soft power"" initiatives.

Egypt has stepped up a crackdown on media outlets it deems to be publishing reports which might harm national security, as the country approaches an election where President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is virtually guaranteed a second term, and the military fights to crush Islamic State militants in the Sinai Peninsula.

Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, in an annual report submitted to the United Nations Human Rights Council, said: ""Potential candidates have allegedly been pressured to withdraw, some through arrests. Legislation prevents candidates and supporters from organizing rallies. Independent media have been silenced, with over 400 media and NGO websites completely blocked.""

1661,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 04:40AM ET</span>",Asian giants China and India flex muscles over tiny Maldives,"By Sanjeev Miglani and Shihar Aneez
NEW DELHI/COLOMBO (Reuters) - A Chinese naval combat force that entered the Indian Ocean for the first time in four years may have helped deter an Indian intervention in the Maldives after its pro-China president imposed a state of emergency, according to military and diplomatic sources and analysts.
India has traditionally been the biggest player in the tiny island chain 400 km (250 miles) to its south, and faced calls from Maldives' opposition leaders last month to use force against President Abdulla Yameen to restore democracy.
After the state of emergency was declared India - which sent troops to foil a coup in the Maldives three decades ago - moved aircraft and ships to its southern bases and put special forces on standby, two military sources in New Delhi said.
But in the end, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held off from hard action, unwilling to entangle the military in a foreign country of 400,000 people, the sources said. 
Beijing's signals it would not look kindly on any foreign involvement in the Maldives - where it is investing millions of dollars as part of its Belt and Road Initiative - backed up by its naval presence in the eastern Indian Ocean, may also have weighed against an intervention, security analysts said. 
China's defense ministry said the ships carried out routine exercises. ""These drills were normal exercises for this year and not aimed at any third party,"" the ministry said in a statement to Reuters, when asked whether the maneuvers were linked to the crisis in Maldives. It did not elaborate.
Beijing's foreign ministry said it was paying close attention to events in the Maldives and had asked the government in Male to protect Chinese interests there.
India's defense ministry did not respond to a request for comment. A naval official confirmed the Chinese ships entered the Indian Ocean, but said they were thousands of miles away from the Maldives. 
""The Indian navy has a robust maritime domain awareness and we have a clear picture of the happenings in the Indian Ocean Region,"" the official said. 
Details of the deployments by India and China as well as diplomatic messages from Beijing that have not previously been reported, show how the Asian giants flexed military muscles as the crisis in the strategically located archipelago unfolded.
Both militaries have since backed off and last week Vijay Gokhale, India's top diplomat, made an unscheduled visit to Beijing where the two sides discussed ways to address their ""differences on the basis of mutual respect and sensitivity to each other's concerns, interests and aspirations,"" the Indian foreign ministry said. It did not give more details.
Liu Zongyi, a South Asia expert at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies, told the People's Daily in January that Yameen's tilt towards China had caused unhappiness in New Delhi.
India had been infuriated with the signing of a free trade deal with China last December, he said, adding: ""The political unrest in the Maldives in actual fact is a power struggle with international factors."" 
CHINESE FLOTILLA
At the end of January, a Chinese navy ""surface action group"", which included an amphibious Type 071 vessel for troops to make a marine landing, quietly crossed into the Indian Ocean through Indonesia's Sunda Straits. 
It was the first time such a force entered the area since an exercise by a similar group in 2014 in the eastern Indian Ocean that raised concern in India about Chinese motives behind conducting amphibious drills. 
Thousands of miles away in the Maldives, Yameen, long criticized for running his Muslim majority nation with an iron fist, rejected a surprise Supreme Court decision on Feb. 1 to free political dissidents. 
Instead, the Maldives' leader threw the judges too into prison and imposed a state of emergency, saying he was acting to thwart a coup. 
Beijing said events in the Maldives were an internal matter and the international community should play ""a constructive role"" and avoid ""further complicating the situation"". Meanwhile, the People's Liberation Army posted photos of the warships, whose number had by then swelled to 11, taking part in rescue training exercises, according to Chinese state media.
Some analysts saw a carefully calibrated message from China.
""These are 'grey zone' tactics, you don't raise the level of provocation to a level that the adversary finds a reason to react or retaliate, but you send the message home,"" said Abhijit Singh, a former Indian naval officer, at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation.
""The message to India was: 'if you come too close to the Maldives, we are not too far away'.""
China, whose navy is now four times bigger than India's, is increasingly asserting itself in the Indian Ocean. It has built a network of friendly ports, its so-call ""String of Pearls"", around shipping lanes through which more than three-quarters of its oil moves.
MILITARY MANEUVERS
Soon after the emergency was declared in the Maldives, India's military moved C-130 Super Hercules and C-17 Globemaster transport planes from near Delhi to its Yelahanka air force base near the southern city of Bengaluru, and ordered paratroops to be on stand-by, the two Indian military source said. 
Warships were also put on readiness at the southern naval command in Kochi, they said. A government official dealing with security issues said moving planes and ships was standard operating procedure for the military.
A few days later the Indian navy launched ""large-scale operational exercises"" in the western Indian Ocean involving 40 warships including an aircraft carrier. The naval official said these were pre-planned.
Yameen was unfazed, and on Feb. 20 extended the emergency by another 30 days despite international calls not to do so.
A source close to Chinese diplomats in Colombo said that Beijing had told its missions in the region that China stood ready to help Yameen if India tried to unseat him. The source was not clear whether that included military help. 
A diplomat at the Maldives' embassy in Colombo said Beijing had given the same assurance of support to the Yameen government. A second diplomat said China had been dragged into the political crisis by the Maldivian opposition, which accused Beijing of grabbing some of its islands.
Throughout the crisis, the Maldivian government was in continuous contact with the Chinese embassy in Male and China was informed about Yameen's every move, including the state of emergency well, in advance, the first diplomat said. 
""The Chinese interest is purely commercial,"" Maldives' minister of fisheries and agriculture Mohamed Shainee said. ""They have invested a lot and they have to protect their investments.""

1662,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",Five facts on the discovery of WW2 warship 'Lady Lex',"(Reuters) - The wreck of the USS Lexington, an American warship sunk in a Pacific naval battle during the Second World War, has been found by a team working for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Paul Allen.
The iconic aircraft carrier was discovered on March 4 in the Coral Sea, about 500 miles (800 km) from Australia's east coast, according to Allen's website.
Here are five facts about the warship nicknamed ""Lady Lex"".
EARLY DAYS
The Lexington was originally designed as a battlecruiser, but was later converted into one of the U.S. Navy's early aircraft carriers. It joined the fleet in 1928, the fourth U.S. Navy ship to be named after the Battle of Lexington in the American Revolutionary War.
The Lexington was at sea when the Japanese navy attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, drawing the United States into the Second World War.
BATTLE OF CORAL SEA 
Over four days in May 1942, the Lexington and another carrier, USS Yorktown, battled a Japanese carrier fleet threatening New Guinea and Australia.
It was the first naval battle in history fought with the opposing ships never seeing each other. Historians consider the battle a draw, with both sides suffering losses, but it did blunt a Japanese advance.
The Lexington, badly damaged by Japanese torpedoes, bombs and secondary fires, was abandoned and scuttled on May 8. More than 200 crew, of a total of nearly 3,000 aboard, died in the battle. 
THE SEARCH
Allen's expedition team used a research ship, the Petrel, acquired by the billionaire in 2016 to explore and survey historic warships and artifacts.
The 25-foot (8-m) Petrel carries subsea equipment able to reach depths of 6,000 meters (19,700 ft), according to Allen's website. The team was helped by accurate accounts of where the Lexington went down, but still had to contend with harsh conditions.
""It's thousands of meters deep and it's very unpredictable,"" said Robert Kraft, director of subsea operations. ""We're putting a lot of electronics and high voltage down to very deep waters and sea water, where it shouldn't belong.""
THE WRECK
The Lexington was found on March 4 resting on the floor of the Coral Sea at a depth of 3,000 meters (1.86 miles). 
Allen's team posted close-up video of its anti-aircraft guns, the ship's name still visible on the hull, and a torpedo lying on the sea floor.
The footage also showed some of the 35 fighter and bomber aircraft that went down with the ship.
""There's no commercial value but there is, obviously...a historic and an archaeological value to looking for the Lexington,"" Kraft said.
OTHER DISCOVERIES
Allen-led expeditions have found other famous ships in recent years.
In 2015, they discovered the sunken Japanese warship Musashi, one of the largest battleships ever built, off the Philippines' coast. That ended a decades-long mystery about the exact location of the ship after it was attacked by U.S. aircraft in 1944.
In December 2017, the team used a remotely-operated undersea vehicle to explore and document the remains of the destroyer USS Ward at the bottom of Ormoc Bay in the Philippines.
The Ward is best known for firing the first American shot in the Second World War, when it attacked a Japanese midget submarine near Pearl Harbor early on Dec. 7, 1941.

SALISBURY, England (Reuters) - Britain said on Wednesday that investigators now knew more about a mystery substance that struck down a former Russian double agent and his daughter in an English city, in a case that threatens to further damage already strained ties with Moscow.
Sergei Skripal, once a colonel in Russia's GRU military intelligence service, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, were found slumped unconscious on a bench outside a shopping center in the southern English city of Salisbury on Sunday afternoon.
Both remain critically ill in intensive care.
British politicians and media have speculated that Russia may have been behind the suspected poisoning of a man it regards as a traitor. Moscow has strongly rejected any involvement.
""We do know more about the substance and the police will be making a further statement this afternoon in order to share some of that,"" interior minister Amber Rudd said after chairing the government's emergency response committee.
""We need to keep a cool head and make sure that we collect all the evidence we can and we need to make sure that we respond not to rumor,"" Rudd said. ""Then we will need to decide what action to take.""
Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation and Britain's military research laboratory at Porton Down is trying to identify the substance which caused Skripal, 66, and his daughter to collapse.
The suspected poisoning prompted Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson to say on Tuesday that if Moscow were behind the incident then Britain could look again at sanctions and take other measures to punish Russia, which he cast as a ""malign and disruptive"" state.
On Wednesday Russia reaffirmed its view that allegations of Russian involvement in the case were being cynically used to whip up an anti-Russian campaign in Britain.
""It's very hard not to assess this (speculation) as provocative black PR designed to complicate relations between our two countries,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters in Moscow.
A source close to the British investigation said that Russian involvement in the Skripal poisoning was just one of the versions being looked at by counter-terrorism investigators with assistance from the MI5 domestic intelligence agency. 
Police said new cordons had been added near Solstice Park, a business park, in the town of Amesbury near to Salisbury. They have sealed off the area of Salisbury where Skripal was found as well as the Zizzi pizza restaurant where they dined and the Bishop's Mill pub where they had a drink.
Some emergency workers were treated after the incident and one remains in hospital. 
""NEED TO DETER RUSSIA""
The British capital has been dubbed ""Londongrad"" due to the large amounts of Russian wealth which have flowed westwards since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union. It is the Western city of choice for many oligarchs from the former Soviet Union.
Britain has specifically drawn parallels with the 2006 murder of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko who was killed with radioactive polonium-210 in London.
A previous British inquiry said Russian President Vladimir Putin probably approved the murder of Litvinenko, who died after drinking green tea laced with the rare and very potent radioactive isotope at London's Millennium Hotel.
It took three weeks for British doctors to ascertain that Litvinenko had been poisoned by polonium-210 by which time he was at death's door.
Russia denied involvement in the death of Litvinenko, which the British inquiry said had been hatched by the Federal Security Service (FSB), main successor to the Soviet-era KGB.
Former British defense minister Michael Fallon called for a stronger response if Russia was involved in the Skripal affair. 
""We’ve got to respond more effectively than we did last time over Litvinenko. Our response then clearly wasn’t strong enough,"" Fallon told Reuters. ""We need to deter Russia from believing they can get away with attacks like this on our streets if it’s proved.""
Litvinenko's murder sent Britain's ties with Russia to what was then a post-Cold War low. Relations suffered further from Russia's annexation of Crimea and its military backing for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
The suspected poisoning of Skripal has come shortly before Russia's presidential election on March 18, which Putin is expected to win comfortably, extending his rule by a further six years. The former KGB officer has been president since 2000.
Russia's FSB arrested Skripal in 2004 on suspicion of betraying dozens of Russian agents to British intelligence. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2006 after a secret trial.

In 2010 Skripal was given refuge in Britain after being exchanged for Russian spies caught in the West as part of a Cold War-style spy swap at Vienna airport.

Police imposed an indefinite curfew in the central highlands district of Kandy where the violence has been centered since Sunday night following the death of a Buddhist youth in an altercation with a group of Muslims.
But police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said there had been ""several incidents"" throughout Tuesday night in the Kandy area, popular with tourists for its tea gardens. 
""The police arrested seven people. Three police officers were injured from the incidents,"" Gunasekara told Reuters. There was no information about how many civilians had been injured in the attacks, he said.
Tension has been growing between the two communities in Sri Lanka over the past year, with some hardline Buddhist groups accusing Muslims of forcing people to convert to Islam and vandalizing Buddhist archaeological sites.
Some Buddhist nationalists have also protested against the presence in Sri Lanka of Muslim Rohingya asylum-seekers from mostly Buddhist Myanmar, where Buddhist nationalism has also been on the rise.
President Maithripala Sirisena imposed a state of emergency for seven days on Tuesday, aiming to stop the violence from spreading to other parts of the country still healing from a 26-year civil war against Tamil separatists that ended in 2009.
A government minister said the latest violence in Kandy had been whipped up by people from outside the area. ""There is an organized conspiracy behind these incidents,"" Sarath Amunugama, a senior minister told reporters in Colombo. 
He said the government will implement the rule of law impartially in the overwhelmingly Buddhist nation in which Muslims make up 9 percent of the 21 million population, the smallest minority after ethnic Tamils, most of whom are Hindus. 

Police ordered Dialog Axiata, the country's largest mobile phone service provider, to restrain internet connections in the Kandy district after postings appeared on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) threatening attacks on Muslims.

The four parties in the center-right coalition agreed during the campaign that the leader of the party that won the most votes would head a government.
In a personal defeat for Berlusconi, the far-right League surpassed his Forza Italia (FI) party in Sunday's elections, winning about 17 percent of the vote to 14 percent for FI.
""In full respect of our agreements, we will now loyally support attempts by (Matteo) Salvini to form a government,"" Berlusconi told Corriere della Sera.
""I am here to support him, to guarantee the solidity of the coalition and keep our commitments with the voters,"" he said.

Queensland woman Jo Grant married her partner of eight years, Jill Kindt, on Dec. 15 in the garden of their home on Australia's northeast Sunshine Coast, less than a week after the nation became the 26th country to recognize same sex unions.
The couple had avoided a 30-day waiting period and were granted exceptional circumstances to become Australia's first married same sex couple following the passage of the marriage equality laws on Dec. 9. 
The wedding had remained private until it was revealed with the family's permission in parliament on Wednesday. 
""Jo and Jill were approved, married, and registered all in one day, after the registrar ruled exceptional circumstances,"" Queensland Attorney General Yvette D'Ath told parliament. 
""Jo’s mum Sandra believes the marriage renewed Jo's spirit, keeping her alive long enough to have one last Christmas with her family.""

By Katharine Houreld
NAIROBI (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson flew to Ethiopia at the start of his first diplomatic trip to Africa on Wednesday, seeking to bolster security alliances on a continent increasingly turning to China for aid and trade.
He was due to visit the African Union where many officials are still smarting from U.S. President Donald Trump's reported dismissal of member states as ""shithole"" countries in January. Trump later denied making the comment.
U.S. officials said Tillerson would focus on discussing ways of fighting terrorism and promoting stability, trade and investment on the week-long tour.
""The long reach of terrorism threatens to steal the future of countless individuals,"" Tillerson said in a speech at Virginia's George Mason University shortly before departing on Tuesday. 
Militant attacks in Africa had risen to more than 1,500 per year from around 300 in 2009, he said. 
""A growing population of young people, if left without jobs and a hope for the future, will create new ways for terrorists to exploit the next generation, subverting stability and derailing democratic governments."" 
Tillerson then announced an additional $533 million in aid for countries hit by drought and conflict. 
The U.S. Secretary of State was due to visit Ethiopia, the home of the African Union, and Kenya - both key U.S. allies in the fight against al Shabaab Islamist militants in Somalia.
He was also scheduled to visit tiny Djibouti, host to sprawling U.S., French and Chinese military bases.
In West Africa, Tillerson will visit Chad and Nigeria, both major oil-producers struggling to contain the Islamist Boko Haram insurgency. 
Analysts say Trump has focused mainly on security concerns in Africa at a time when China, Turkey and other nations are ramping up diplomatic and business links. 
POSTS UNFILLED
Trump has authorized the use of more aggressive U.S. military operations in Somalia and the deaths of four U.S. soldiers in Niger last year shone a spotlight on increasing U.S. counter-terrorism engagement in West Africa.
At the same time, key ambassadorships in South Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo and other nations remain unfilled, along with the continent's top diplomatic position, the assistant secretary of state for Africa. 
Trump has said he wants to cut the budgets for foreign aid and the State Department by a third. 
""Africa is ready and open for business. And the Chinese have understood it and have been more proactive and aggressive in a way that it's benefiting them,"" Brahima Coulibaly, the director of the Africa Growth Initiative at Brookings Institution, said, commenting on the trip.
Acting Assistant Secretary for African Affairs Don Yamamoto told journalists on Monday that U.S. diplomats were becoming concerned about the high levels of Chinese debt some nations were incurring. 
""The United States was concerned that some Chinese loans were pushing countries back into heavy debt not long after they received debt relief from international financial institutions,"" he said. 
""We're seeing countries at 50 percent, 100 percent, and in one case 200 percent of GDP debt based on concessionary loans from China.""

China surpassed the United States to become Africa's largest trading partner in 2009.

1670,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 08:07AM ET</span>",Damascus intensifies Ghouta assault in bid to cut rebel enclave in half,"By Tom Perry and Angus McDowall 
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian government forces pounded eastern Ghouta with air strikes on Wednesday in an effort to slice the rebel enclave in two as they intensified a campaign to deal the opposition its biggest defeat since 2016.
The Syrian government assault of the densely populated area on the outskirts of Damascus, which began more than two weeks ago, has become one of the fiercest campaigns of the war now entering its eighth year, with bombardment killing hundreds.
Live footage broadcast by Syrian state TV from the outskirts of the town of Mesraba showed enormous clouds of smoke rising into the sky. The sounds of explosions and jets could be heard.
A state TV correspondent said militant defenses in the town were being struck by ""preparatory fire"" in advance of a planned infantry assault. ""Mesraba is under heavy attack today,"" said Khalil Aybour, a member of an opposition council in Ghouta. 
Capturing Mesraba would be a major step towards severing the northern half of the Ghouta, including its biggest town, Douma, from the southern part. Government forces have seized more than 40 percent of the territory so far.
Civilians have been fleeing frontline areas into Douma and hiding in cellars.
""It's bad in the basement, but it's better than the bombing,"" Adnan, 30, a Douma resident who has been sheltering below ground with his wife and two-year-old daughter together with 10 other families, told Reuters by telephone.
The United Nations says 400,000 people are trapped in the towns and villages of the eastern Ghouta, under government siege for years and already running out of food and medicine before the assault. An aid convoy reached the area this week but government officials had stripped out most medical supplies.
Russia, President Bashar al-Assad's most powerful ally, has offered rebel fighters safe passage out with their families and personal weapons. The proposal echoes previous agreements under which insurgents, in the face of military defeat, were permitted to withdraw to opposition-held areas at the Turkish border. 
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group says 800 civilians have been killed by government bombing and shelling. The Observatory said an extra 700 pro-government militia fighters had arrived at the front as reinforcements to join the operation. 
The U.N. Security Council has called for a 30-day countrywide ceasefire, but Moscow and Damascus have not halted the campaign, arguing that the fighters they are striking are members of banned terrorist groups unprotected by the truce.
Russia's defense ministry said on Wednesday some rebels wanted to accept the proposal to evacuate. So far rebels have dismissed it in public. The military spokesman for one of the main eastern Ghouta rebel groups said rebels would defend the territory and there were no negotiations over a withdrawal.
""The factions of Ghouta and their fighters and its people are holding onto their land and will defend it,"" Hamza Birqdar of Jaish al-Islam told Reuters in a text message sent overnight.
The opposition says such evacuation agreements amount to a policy of demographic change by which Assad has forcibly displaced those who oppose him.
In an interview on state TV, a Syrian army colonel expressed confidence Ghouta would fall quickly, saying the people there would return to the ""state's embrace"" ""very, very, very soon"".
A commander in the military alliance fighting in support of Assad said he anticipated that rebels would end up besieged in Douma and then accept a withdrawal deal.
Assad said this week that the majority of people in eastern Ghouta want a return of state rule. But rebels and opposition activists say people fear government persecution.
COMPLICITY 
Russian warplanes have taken part in the eastern Ghouta operation, and the White House has accused Russia of complicity in the killing of civilians there.
Defeat in eastern Ghouta would mark the biggest setback for the anti-Assad rebellion since the opposition was driven from eastern Aleppo in late 2016 after a similar campaign of siege, bombing, ground assaults and the promise of safe passage out.
Moscow and Damascus say the Ghouta campaign is necessary to halt rebel shelling of the capital. The Observatory says such shelling has killed at least 27 people since Feb. 18, and Syrian state media have given a higher death toll.
Assad has steadily recovered rebel-held areas in western Syria since Russia intervened directly on his side in 2015.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Tuesday voiced concern about attacks in eastern Ghouta which ""reportedly claimed the lives of more than 100 people"" on Monday alone, as well as reports of shelling of Damascus.
Western states have been demanding Russia press Assad to abide by the 30-day ceasefire. The Security Council, where Russia holds a veto, will meet on Wednesday to discuss the failed ceasefire.
The U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said the government offensive could not be justified by its targeting of a few hundred fighters.
""Recent attempts to justify indiscriminate, brutal attacks on hundreds of thousands of civilians by the need to combat a few hundred fighters – as in Eastern Ghouta – are legally, and morally, unsustainable,"" he told the U.N. Human Rights Council.

""Also, when you are prepared to kill your own people so easily, lying is easy too. Claims by the Government of Syria that it is taking every measure to protect its civilian population are frankly ridiculous.""

The commander did not explain during what time period the production increase had taken place.
“In the past we had to do a lot of explaining to various bodies for our actions but it’s not like that anymore,” Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of the Guards’ aerospace division said, according to Fars. 
""Our production has increased three-fold compared to the past,"" he said, referring to missiles.
The government, parliament and other Iranian officials had, in particular, agreed on the need for ground-to-ground missiles, Hajizadeh said.
Fars gave no further details.
France’s foreign minister visited Iran on Monday on a delicate mission to reaffirm Europe’s support for a nuclear deal that opened Iran’s economy, while echoing U.S. concern about its missile program and role in regional conflicts.
Jean-Yves Le Drian's visit reflected French efforts to safeguard Iran's 2015 accord with major powers. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to pull out of the deal unless three European signatories help “fix” it by forcing Iran to limit its sway in the Middle East and rein in its missile program.

Senior Iranian officials told Le Drian on Monday that Iran’s ballistic missile program was not up for negotiation.

1672,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 01:30AM ET</span>",Detained asylum seeker released after suing Trump administration,"(Reuters) - Federal authorities have released a Congolese woman seeking asylum with her daughter in the U.S. after she accused the Trump administration of unfairly separating immigrants like herself from their children, her lawyer said on Tuesday. 
The woman, referred to in her lawsuit only as Ms. L, was ""abruptly released"" after she was detained in San Diego and her 7-year-old daughter was sent by federal authorities to Chicago four months ago, the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement. 
""We hope that she'll be reunited with her daughter immediately. And we will continue fighting this horrific nationwide practice, because this mother is hardly the only asylum seeker who has had his or her child taken,"" said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, who is representing the woman in court.
The ACLU said the woman had brought her daughter to the United States to escape violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
The woman filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court Southern District of California on Feb. 26, claiming that the Trump administration violated her constitutional due process rights, a federal law protecting asylum seekers and the government’s own directive to release asylum seekers, court documents showed. 
People seeking asylum in the United States are interviewed by an asylum officer, and if they are found to have credible fear of returning home, they can remain in the country to pursue their claims in immigration court. 
Court challenges have led to limits on the amount of time children can be kept in immigration detention, and the government has often decided to release parents along with their children to await resolution of asylum cases. 
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has criticized the asylum process as rife with fraud. The administration has floated the idea of separating families at the border in an attempt to deter their migration. 
""This is not a one-off case,"" Gelernt said at the time the lawsuit was filed. ""We are hearing there are dozens if not hundreds of cases around the country. And the Administration is threatening to do even more family separation."" 
The lawsuit said Ms. L. and her daughter hid in a Catholic Church in her strife-torn homeland before deciding to risk a journey to the United States.
She explained to border officials in broken Spanish that she was seeking asylum and since Nov. 1 has been held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center. Four days after their arrival, her daughter was transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which houses and places children that arrive on the border alone.

1673,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 04:32AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Mexico left-wing candidate's lead widens as rivals bicker - poll,"By Christine Murray
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican left-wing presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador extended his lead to 14 points in an opinion poll completed last week, with a fight between his opponents over accusations of financial wrongdoing weighing on their support.
Lopez Obrador has 35 percent support ahead of the July 1 vote according to the survey by polling firm Parametria, published by Reuters on Wednesday ahead of wider publication. 
That compared with 34 percent and an 11 percentage point lead in a survey by the same company a month earlier.
Lopez Obrador appeared to benefit from a tussle for second place between his opponents, who have spent the last couple of weeks accusing each other of corruption, with the former Mexico City mayor sitting comfortably above the fray.
""The fight for second place is damaging them both,"" Parametria founder Francisco Abundis said. ""For citizens, these disputes are very tiring."" 
In the number two spot, Ricardo Anaya of left-right coalition ""For Mexico in Front,"" slipped to 21 percent support, from 23 percent in the previous poll.
Former finance minister and ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) hopeful Jose Antonio Meade slid for the second consecutive month, to 16 percent from 18 percent.
The poll was taken between Feb. 24 and March 1, as the mudslinging was intensifying.
At the center of the Anaya controversy is the purchase and sale of real estate in an industrial park in the state of Queretaro between 2014 and 2016, which Meade says led to illicit enrichment by his rival. Anaya said the deals were legitimate.
Anaya responded by pointing to irregularities detected by federal auditors worth millions of dollars in the accounts of the ministry for social development when it was run by Rosario Robles, now minister for agrarian, land and urban development. 
Anaya's campaign says some of the embezzlement of public funds happened when Meade was minister at the ministry, an accusation Meade's team calls a ""lie.""
The poll is based on interviews with 800 people in their homes; 12 percent either did not answer, responded that they did not know or could not choose a candidate listed. The poll has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points.
Lopez Obrador's 14-point lead is larger than in other recent polls done before the recent furor over Anaya's business dealings. Mexico's Reforma newspaper gave him an 8-point lead, while polling organization Consulta Mitofsky put the gap at just 5 percentage points.
Independent hopeful and former first lady Margarita Zavala surged to 10 percent of the vote in the Parametria poll, while on-leave Nuevo Leon Governor Jaime Rodriguez grew to 5 percent.

The campaign starts officially on March 30. Candidates will participate in the first television debate on April 22 in Mexico City.

The fiery-tempered leader is the subject of a Philippine lawyer's complaint to the ICC accusing him of making killing ""best practice"" in his ferocious 19-month-old war on drugs.
The ICC last month said it had started a preliminary examination to establish whether it had jurisdiction, and if crimes against humanity had been committed.
""You cannot acquire jurisdiction over me, not in a million years,"" Duterte said in a speech late on Tuesday.
""That is why I don't respond to them. That's the truth.""
He added: ""Believe it. They cannot ever, ever hope to acquire jurisdiction over my person.""
Duterte has previously called the ICC ""useless"" and ""hypocritical"", the kind of comments that have maintained his appeal among voters drawn by his defiance and maverick style.
Though he says he would be open to any investigations by the United Nations and ICC, he last week told security forces they should not cooperate with them.
The ICC is a court of last resort and only steps in when a country’s government is found to be unwilling or unable to do so.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque predicted that the ICC would find it had no jurisdiction in the Philippines and no crime to investigate.
""Because Philippine courts are able and willing, the International Criminal Court has no jurisdiction,"" Roque said in a regular news briefing. 
""When it comes to merit, the war against drugs cannot be considered a crime against humanity."" 
He said the campaign had a legitimate, counter-narcotics purpose and was ""an official exercise of the police powers of the state"".
The government denies activists' allegations that drug dealers and users are being systematically targeted for execution.
Police say they have killed about 4,100 drug dealers, in shootouts, but have no ties to unidentified armed men who have killed hundreds of drug users.

Duterte has also said the Philippines' ICC membership might be invalid on a domestic level, because Manila's 2011 accession to the ICC's Rome Statute was not announced in the country's official gazette.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's grand welcome for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will begin on Wednesday with a lunch with Queen Elizabeth, as the two countries seek to widen longstanding defense ties into a far-reaching partnership.
Both sense an opportunity to broaden their existing relationship: Britain is looking for trading partners as it exits the European Union, and Saudi Arabia needs to convince skeptical investors about its domestic reforms. 
But as Prince Mohammed and Prime Minister Theresa May meet, demonstrators will protest both countries' roles in Yemen where war has killed an estimated 10,000 people and where 8.3 million people depend on food aid and 400,000 children have life-threatening levels of malnutrition. 
Inside May's Downing Street offices the two leaders will launch a ""UK-Saudi Strategic Partnership Council"" - an initiative to encourage Saudi Arabia's economic reforms and foster more cooperation on issues such as education and culture, as well as defense and security. 
""It will usher in a new era of bilateral relations, focused on a partnership that delivers wide-ranging benefits for both of us,"" May's spokesman told reporters.
Britain is vying to land the stock market listing of state oil firm Saudi Aramco, but no decision is expected this week. 
Later this month Prince Mohammed visits the United States, which also wants the lucrative listing, although sources said both countries may miss out.
British officials were privately delighted at the decision by Prince Mohammed, 32, to choose Britain as the major western destination on his first foreign trip since becoming heir to the Saudi throne last year.
The British government is keen to transform its historic defense relationship into two-way trade and investment, eyeing both an expanded market in Saudi Arabia for service sector exports, and attracting Saudi cash to finance domestic projects.
Business deals are possible with British defense group BAE Systems (LON:BAES) and European weapons maker MBDA, and initial agreements could be concluded on gas exploration, petrochemicals and other industries, according to British and Saudi sources. 
ROYAL TREATMENT
The three-day visit will include two audiences with the British Royal family, a briefing with national security officials, and a prestigious visit to the prime minister's country residence.
May intends to use the private dinner at Chequers, a 16th-century manor house 40 miles (60 km) northwest of London, to bring up concerns over the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, her spokesman said.
A Saudi-led military coalition is fighting the Houthi movement in Yemen, generating what the United Nation said in January was the world's worst humanitarian crisis.
""You can expect them to discuss Yemen, and the prime minister to raise deep concerns at the humanitarian situation,"" May's spokesman said. ""She will also reiterate how seriously we take allegations of violations against international humanitarian law.""
Speaking to reporters in London on Monday, Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir said his country had failed to effectively communicate the reasons behind its involvement in Yemen, but that they had not chosen to start the war. 
Protestors are planning to target the Saudi officials over Yemen and other human rights issues, and Britain for licensing 4.6 billion pounds of weapons sales to Saudi Arabia since 2015.
Buses have spent two days touring London with banners accusing Prince Mohammed of war crimes, with more planned for Wednesday ahead of the main rally. 

""It is vital that people show up to the protest tomorrow outside Downing Street to make clear that the UK government's complicity in the war on Yemen is not supported by the public and that we demand a peaceful and humane foreign policy,"" said Lindsey German of the Stop the War Coalition.

1677,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 11:17PM ET</span>","North Korea overture seen as tiny step on rocky, unpromising road","By Arshad Mohammed and David Brunnstrom
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In floating the possibility of nuclear talks with the United States, North Korea took a first step on a road likely to be long, more arduous and just as prone to failure as past efforts.
Former U.S. officials who have dealt with the North reacted with deep skepticism to Pyongyang's offer, made public by South Korea, to hold talks with the United States on denuclearization and to halt nuclear and missile tests while negotiating.
While arguing it is worth testing the waters to see if North Korea is willing to give up its nuclear program, and to glean intelligence from dealing with the secretive nation's officials, they see virtually no chance Pyongyang will actually do so.
""For the past three decades, (administrations) of both political parties have tried every single option ... except the use of military force and none of these have halted the North,"" said Mitchell Reiss, a senior U.S. diplomat under Republican former President George W. Bush who has negotiated with North Korea.
North Korea is likely to make demands that the United States would find anathema following Pyongyang's reported statement that it has no need for a nuclear program ""if military threats against the North are resolved and its regime is secure,"" former U.S. officials said.
North Korea in the past has sought the withdrawal of U.S. forces in South Korea and the wider region, effectively meaning an end to the U.S.-South Korean alliance, something Washington could not accept.
""This is the sort of rhetoric that one encounters at the bare beginnings of a process that can last years, and of course the only processes that have been run with North Korea on the nuclear issue have come a cropper,"" said a former U.S. official involved in talks with North Korea who spoke on condition of anonymity, using an idiom meaning failed.
FRESH MEMORIES OF FAILURE
Under the 1994 ""Agreed Framework"" negotiated under Democratic former U.S. President Bill Clinton, North Korea committed to freeze and dismantle its nuclear facilities in return for two lightwater reactors and fuel oil while the nuclear power plants were built.
That pact unraveled after Bush took office in 2001, with relations souring when he called North Korea part of an ""axis of evil"" and accused it of running a uranium enrichment program in violation of the 1994 deal.
The Bush administration ultimately engaged in ""six-party"" talks that achieved a deal in September 2005 under which North Korea agreed to give up its nuclear program in return for economic and energy aid and an end to its diplomatic isolation.
Those talks included the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States.
Relations again deteriorated when the United States froze North Korean accounts at a Macau bank in late 2005 and accused it of money laundering and when Pyongyang conducted its first nuclear test in October 2006.
In 2007, a new deal was struck under which North Korea would get a million tons of heavy fuel oil in return for steps to shut down and seal its main Yongbyon nuclear plant that produces weapons-grade plutonium and to invite inspectors to oversee them. That agreement unraveled in 2009.
'PEACE HAS NOT BROKEN OUT'
North Korea has conducted six nuclear weapons tests and pushed ahead on trying to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles that, if mated to a nuclear warhead, could threaten the U.S. mainland.
Current and former U.S. officials said as a practical matter it is far more difficult to get a country to give up a weapons system it already possesses rather than one it is still developing.
""It's much harder to get the North Koreans to undo something they have done in terms of missile development and nuclear development,"" said Daniel Russel, a former U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific.
""Peace has not broken out on the Korean peninsula,"" Russel said, adding that North Korea so far has done nothing to signal a willingness to concede on denuclearization. 
Russel said he saw the latest North Korean move as fitting a well-established pattern in which ""the North Korean game has been to offer to rent some peace and quiet to the West.""
""What traditionally comes next is that they move up a ladder of escalating demands without offering significant or irreversible commitments or concessions, and finally, when they hit the limit and the U.S. or South Koreans put their foot down, that becomes the pretext to revert to the cycle of provocations.""
Nevertheless, said Chris Hill, the key U.S. negotiator with North Korea from 2005 to 2009, it is important for the Americans not to look stubborn or churlish about the prospects.
""We need to be responsive and not miss the moment,"" Hill said, if only to show the people of American allies South Korea and Japan that the United States is willing to talk. ""That said, I don't think we have peace in our times.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - An Iraqi-Canadian man on Tuesday pleaded guilty to a U.S. charge that he helped orchestrate the April 2009 truck bombing of a U.S. base in Mosul, Iraq, that killed five soldiers.
Faruq Khalil Muhammad 'Isa, 50, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to murder Americans. The charge carries a maximum sentence of life in prison, but prosecutors have agreed to a sentence of 26 years, under a plea deal described by U.S. District Judge Roslynn Mauskopf in Brooklyn.
Mauskopf did not decide Tuesday whether to accept that agreement. She said that if she decides not to accept it, 'Isa will be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Peter Baldwin said in court that the prosecutors had consulted with the families of the victims of the attack, and that some supported the deal while others did not.
""While no amount of jail time can make up for the loss of a family member, the government believes that the agreed-upon sentence provides a fair and just resolution to the very serious charges brought against the defendant,"" Baldwin said.
""We are mindful of how difficult this case is for so many, but think that the proposed plea agreement would be an appropriate resolution of the case,"" Mildred Whalen, a lawyer for Isa, said in an email after the hearing.
'Isa, who was born in Iraq and is an Iraqi and Canadian citizen, was arrested in Edmonton, Alberta, in 2011. He is also known as Sayfildin Tahir Sharif.
Prosecutors have said that, while living in Canada, 'Isa conspired with a group of militants that carried out a suicide truck bombing on April 10, 2009, at the United States' Forward Operating Base Marez in Mosul.
In addition to the conspiracy charge, the indictment charged 'Isa with murdering each of the five victims and with supporting terrorists. Prosecutors said at a February 2015 court hearing that 'Isa was working with Islamic state, according to court records.
'Isa did not plead guilty to the murder charges or the terrorism charge.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. general for Africa told lawmakers on Tuesday that the military could face ""significant"" consequences should China take a key port in Djibouti, as Beijing becomes increasingly muscular in Africa in an effort to expand its influence. 
Last month, Djibouti ended its contract with Dubai's DP World, one of the world's biggest port operators, to run the Doraleh Container Terminal, citing failure to resolve a dispute that began in 2012.
DP World called the move an illegal seizure of the terminal and said it had begun new arbitration proceedings before the London Court of International Arbitration.
During a U.S. congressional hearing on Tuesday, which was dominated by concerns about China's role in Africa, lawmakers said they had seen reports that Djibouti seized control of the port to give it to China as a gift. 
China has already built a military base in Djibouti, just miles from a critical U.S. military base.
""If this was an illegal seizure of that port, what is to say that government wouldn't illegally terminate our lease before its term is up,"" said Representative Bradley Byrne, a Republican. 
In a letter to U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Byrne said he was concerned about China's influence in Djibouti and the impact it would have on U.S. military and intelligence assets.
Djibouti is strategically located at the southern entrance to the Red Sea on the route to the Suez Canal.
Marine General Thomas Waldhauser, the top U.S. military commander overseeing troops in Africa, said that if China placed restrictions on the port's use, it could affect resupplying the U.S. base in Djibouti and the ability of Navy ships to refuel there.
""If the Chinese took over that port, then the consequences could be significant,"" Waldhauser said during the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee hearing. 
Djibouti hosts a U.S. military base that is home to about 4,000 personnel, including special operations forces, and is a launch pad for operations in Yemen and Somalia.
""There are some indications of (China) looking for additional facilities, specifically on the eastern coast ... So Djibouti happens to be the first - there will be more,"" Waldhauser said.
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he did not know anything about the port situation, but China's cooperation with Africa was neither aimed at any third party nor aimed at excluding anyone.
""We hope that the U.S. side can objectively and fairly view China's development and China-Africa cooperation,"" he told a daily news briefing.
SOFT POWER 
China has sought to be visible in Africa, including through high-profile investment in public infrastructure projects, as it deepens its trade ties. 
Waldhauser said that the United States would be unable to match the scale of that investment throughout the continent, noting Beijing's construction of shopping malls, government buildings and even soccer stadiums. 
""We'll never outspend the Chinese in (Africa),"" Waldhauser said, noting some of the Chinese investments in Djibouti.
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Tuesday the United States will give more than $533 million in humanitarian aid for victims of conflicts and drought in Ethiopia, Somalia, South Sudan and the West and Central African countries bordering Lake Chad.
But Tillerson contrasted the United States' work on the African continent, which he said promoted ""sustainable growth,"" with that of China, which recently pledged $124 billion for its Silk Road plan to expand links between Asia, Africa, Europe and other places. 
Tillerson said China's investment in Africa ""encouraged dependency.""
This year, the U.S. military put countering China, along with Russia, at the center of a new national defense strategy.
The Pentagon said China was a part of ""revisionist powers"" that ""seek to create a world consistent with their authoritarian models.""
Waldhauser said he was in the process of rewriting U.S. military strategy in the region with China in mind.
""China has been on the African continent for quite some time, but we as a combatant command have not dealt with it in terms of a strategic interest,"" Waldhauser said.

""We are taking baby steps in that regard,"" he added.

The decision by the Superior Court of Justice makes it more likely that Lula, whose conviction on corruption charges was upheld in January by a lower appeals court, could be forced to begin serving out his 12-year sentence in a matter of weeks, even as he appeals to higher courts.
Lula, Brazil's first working-class president, oversaw years of robust growth and falling inequality during a commodity boom last decade and has said he wants to run again for the presidency in October. He leads all early polls.
However, he is likely to be blocked from running by a law that bars the candidacy of any politician with a criminal conviction upheld on appeal. 

Lula faces six other corruption-related trials. Even if he is found guilty in one of the other trials, it is unlikely there would be any appeals decisions in those cases before the October election.

The kingdom is leading a coalition formed in 2015 to fight the Iran-aligned Houthi group that controls most of northern Yemen and the capital Sanaa, in a war that has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced more than three million.
The French administration under President Emmanuel Macron has drawn criticism in particular from rights groups over its support of the kingdom's actions and allowing weapons it has sold to Riyadh potentially to be used in its Yemen operations.
When asked specifically why France continued to sell weapons to Saudi and the Emirates in the current context, Jean-Yves Le Drian skirted the issue and said the priority was to find a political solution to the Yemen crisis.
""I'm really worried by the situation in Yemen,"" Le Drian told parliament's foreign affairs committee. ""It's an absurd war. It's true that there are Saudi weapons, but would you believe it there are Iranian weapons too, lots (of them)."" 
Iran has denied supplying the Houthis weapons.
The two Gulf Arab states are among France's main weapons' clients receiving tanks, armored vehicles, munitions, artillery and in the case of the Emirates, fighter jets. 
Unlike some European states, Paris has shown no concrete signs of reducing or suspending sales to the Saudi-led coalition despite warnings that some of its weapons could be used in the war in Yemen, sources aware of the issue have said. 
However, Paris has grown increasingly concerned by the worsening humanitarian situation and in December Macron called for a ""complete lifting"" of a Saudi blockade on Yemen.

""The problem is the sovereignty of the states that commit their own armies to an absurd conflict, and we hope that ... we will quickly (re-)start the political solution, because it is probably the crisis in the region that would be easiest to resolve if there was the political will on all sides.""

KAMNIK, Slovenia (Reuters) - A former comedian tipped to become Slovenia's next prime minister said on Tuesday he would slash red tape to boost investment and shake up the electoral and judicial systems if his party wins June's national election.
Marjan Sarec, 40, a newcomer to national politics, stunned Slovenians last November when he won 47 percent of the vote in a presidential run-off won by a former prime minister and acting president, Borut Pahor.
His center-left party, The List of Marjan Sarec, formed in 2014, has only about 300 members, but opinion polls show it winning up to 19 percent of the vote, ahead of its rivals.
""We absolutely need to reduce bureaucracy,"" Sarec told Reuters in an interview, adding that he wanted to devolve more power to local communities to facilitate new construction.
Slovenia, a tiny ex-Yugoslav republic of two million people, joined the European Union 14 years ago and has seen strong economic growth that is expected to reach at least 3.9 percent this year.
But many Slovenians are disappointed with established parties over corruption and other issues, especially since their country narrowly avoided an international bailout for its banks in 2013.
Sarec, who is currently mayor of the Alpine town of Kamnik, said he would aim as prime minister to speed up court procedures, which can drag on for years, by limiting the mandate of judges. Most judges in Slovenia have unlimited mandates.
Sarec said he also wanted to raise the threshold for a party to enter parliament to ""at least five percent"" from the current four percent, a level he said resulted in weak coalition governments of at least three parties.
""We have a weak state so we need a strong government,"" he said.
PRIVATIZATIONS
The International Monetary Fund says Slovenia, where the state still controls about 50 percent of the economy, should speed up privatizations, but the government has refused to sell major companies over the past decade.
""We need to keep strategic firms in state hands, like (telecoms operator) Telekom Slovenije and (port operator) Luka Koper,"" he said, adding the state should also not sell minority stakes in companies such as fuel retailer Petrol and pharmaceutical producer Krka.
However, Sarec said Slovenia should sell majority state stakes in its two largest banks, Nova Ljubljanska Banka (NLB) and Abanka, in line with promises made to the European Commission. But the state should retain at least 25 percent of NLB to have a say in key business decisions, he added.
Slovenia has promised to sell the two banks in return for the Commission's approval of state aid to them in 2013.
Sarec said his government would try to run a balanced budget and reduce public debt towards 60 percent of national output, which is the maximum level allowed for eurozone members, adding that this would hinge on future economic growth.
He said the new government would have to introduce pension reform, including further promotion of private pension schemes, to ease the burden of a rapidly aging population on the budget.

Sarec did not disclose possible candidates for cabinet jobs but said he favored independent professionals for some top posts such as finance minister.

The killing of investigative reporter Kuciak, 27, and his fiancee, who were found shot dead at their home on Feb. 25, is the country's largest police investigation in its modern history. The case has rocked the nation and its government. 
Police have said Kuciak's death was probably connected to his reporting. 
Last week, they detained - then later released - seven men whose first names and last initials matched those of subjects Kuciak had written about in his final report. The story, published posthumously, investigated suspected mafia links to Italian businessmen in eastern Slovakia.
The police have not given any further details on its investigation and said in a Tuesday statement they could not provide any more information on prosecutor's orders.
Kalinak, who is facing calls to quit or be sacked, briefed a parliamentary committee on Tuesday.
""The biggest-ever team of investigators is working on the murder of Kuciak and his fiancee. More than 100 witnesses have been interviewed already,"" he said.
Kalinak has faced previous calls to quit. Last year, thousands protested to demand his resignation over ties he had with a developer investigated for tax fraud. Both had denied wrongdoing then.
Prime Minister Robert Fico has again resisted calls to fire his party ally Kalinak, who said on Tuesday his priority was the investigation.
""I don't feel directly responsible for the murder of a journalist (...) but I'm having hard time getting over it,"" he told reporters. ""We will first talk to our coalition partners.""
President Andrej Kiska called on Sunday for substantial changes to the government or early elections to rebuild public trust following the killing.
One of the subjects, Antonino Vadala, in Kuciak's last article had past links to two people who subsequently went on to work in Fico's office. Both have resigned and denied any connection to the killing.
In an interview with Slovak newspaper Korzar published on Tuesday, Vadala denied links to the Italian mafia or Slovak politicians. He said Kuciak mistook him for someone else with the same name but he was killed before Vadala could meet with him and explain.
""Everything that has been written about us, concerns a different Vadala family, not us,"" Vadala was quoted as saying.

Lula, who is likely to be barred from running because of a corruption conviction that was upheld on appeal in January, also had the lowest rejection rate among likely contenders in the survey, conducted by pollster MDA. Support for him in several potential second-round matchups rose from levels in an MDA poll in September.
Still, nearly half of those polled, 46.7 percent, said they would never vote for Lula, underlining widespread voter discontent with political choices in Brazil as graft investigations continue to target the political class.
In a runoff vote against right-wing congressman Jair Bolsonaro, the MDA polls found, Lula would take 44 percent of the vote against 26 percent for his opponent. 
If Lula is barred by courts from running for the presidency, the poll found that Bolsonaro would face environmentalist and former senator Marina Silva in a second-round runoff, which takes place in Brazil if no single candidate wins a majority of votes on the first ballot.
Bolsonaro and Marina Silva are polling within the survey's margin of error in a theoretical runoff, MDA found, a situation repeated in other likely second-round scenarios absent Lula.
Lula has said repeatedly that he wants to run and will fight for that chance in Brazil's top courts. However, the country's constitution, with rare exceptions, bans politicians from running for office if their convictions have been upheld on appeal. The question of whether Lula can run is not likely to be settled by the courts for several months. 
The survey showed that the vast majority of those asked think President Michel Temer is doing a poor job as president, with 73 percent giving a negative evaluation, little changed from the last poll in September, when Temer received a negative rating from 76 percent.

The MDA poll, which had a margin of error of 2.2 percentage points, was commissioned by national transportation association CNT and surveyed 2,002 people across Brazil from Feb. 28 to March 4.

Citizens' rights are one of the relatively easier parts of the negotiation to unravel more than 40 years of union, but hit a snag when Britain said those people arriving from the EU after Brexit day in March next year would be treated differently.
At a meeting in London, May reiterated her belief that the ""expectations of those moving to the UK in this period will not be the same as those who arrived before our withdrawal"", her spokesman said, but offered little detail on her position.
Last week, the government said EU citizens arriving in Britain during a post-Brexit transition period would be able to apply for indefinite leave to stay in the country, but that their rights would be governed by British courts.
""I think it is possible in the coming days and coming weeks ... (to) make progress on this and (that) we can conclude on this,"" Verhofstadt told reporters.
""It should be fine that the citizens rights' chapter is done, it is finished, it is concluded and everybody knows, UK nationals and EU citizens know, what their status is in the future."" 
Other aspects of a deal to end Britain's membership of the EU are likely to be more complicated. 
May urged EU negotiators last week to show more flexibility in talks on a future relationship, asking them to seal a deep trade deal, unlike any that has been signed before, to avoid any hard border with EU member Ireland.

But many of her ideas were met with scepticism, with Verhofstadt saying Britain had added a ""few extra cherries on the cake"".

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Dozens of Argentine lawmakers of all political stripes presented a bill to legalize abortion on Tuesday, launching a debate that promised to divide a deeply Catholic nation.
Amid cheers from activists, around 70 members of the lower house of Congress unveiled a bill that would allow women in Argentina to interrupt pregnancy during the first 14 weeks, according to a copy of the proposal seen by Reuters.
While Argentina's Congress has debated abortion before, the topic has garnered more attention since center-right President Mauricio Macri said he was in favor of debate and would encourage his allies in Congress to vote as they saw fit even though he was personally opposed.
Argentina, like most countries in Latin America, currently permits abortion in specific cases, including rape and risk to the mother's life. Rights groups have criticized a requirement for a judge's permission, which often results in lengthy delays or denial of the procedure. 
An issue that has divided political parties, the abortion proposal could pass the lower house but will likely face resistance in the more conservative Senate. 
The bill emphasizes the danger Argentine women face in seeking clandestine abortions, particularly poor women. About a third of maternal deaths in the country are related to such procedures, the bill says. 
""This is a topic of equality and inequality, because those who do not have money pay with their health or their bodies,"" said opposition lawmaker Aracelia Ferreyra during the presentation of the bill. 
Argentina's neighbor Uruguay is an outlier in Latin America in permitting abortions. A Chilean court last year upheld a law legalizing abortion in certain cases. Chile had been one of only a handful of countries worldwide where the procedure was banned without exception.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Lawmakers from the Alternative for Germany (AfD) are on a fact-finding trip to Syria, said members of the anti-immigrant group, which wants Syria to be classified a safe country of origin in a move that would make it easier to deport failed asylum seekers.
Syrians make up the biggest single group of asylum seekers among the more than a million migrants fleeing war and poverty who have arrived in Europe's largest economy since mid-2015.
The migrant influx, facilitated by Chancellor Angela Merkel's 2015 decision to open Germany's borders, was a boon for the anti-immigrant AfD. It won 12.6 percent in September's election, becoming the biggest opposition party and the first far-right group to sit in the German parliament since the 1960s.
A statement by the lawmakers posted on the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page of Christian Blex, an AfD parliamentarian in the regional assembly of the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, said that he and six other AfD members - some of them lawmakers in the national parliament - were on a private visit to Syria from March 5.
""The experiences the MPs gain will enable them to rationally evaluate the situation in Syria regarding continuing discussions about classifying it as a safe country of origin, which would also affect the decision about halting deportations of rejected asylum seekers,"" the statement said.
The AfD regularly lambasts the media as unreliable and the statement said they did not trust German coverage of Syria, and so the lawmakers would seek to find out first-hand about life in liberated areas of Syria and the government's efforts to provide services for returning refugees.
The AfD in November proposed repatriating half a million Syrian refugees, saying the war was nearly over and that President Bashar al-Assad had urged refugees to return home. 
However, fighting is continuing in many areas, the United Nations says, in a complex civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people since 2011 and forced millions to flee in the worst refugee crisis since World War Two.
Germany has not deported anyone to Syria since 2012 and in December extended that policy until the end of 2018. 
The German upper and lower houses of parliament decide which countries go on the list of safe countries of origin.
Blex posted photos of busy roads, a swimming pool and buildings along with a caption which said they had arrived in Damascus and added: ""You hardly see any military. There are adverts for mobile phones and televisions. Normal daily life.""
Blex said in a separate Facebook posts that the delegation had spoken to representatives of the Syrian parliament and met Syria's Grand Mufti Ahmed Badr al-Din Hassoun, who Blex said called upon all Syrian refugees to return home. The lawmakers said they also plan to visit education facilities.
The visit takes place as Russia has offered Syrian rebels safe passage out of the Damascus enclave of eastern Ghouta, setting out a deal by which the opposition would surrender its last major stronghold near Damascus to Assad.

1693,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>",Italian vote heralds tougher EU stance on migration,"By Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The failure of Italy's neighbors to help out more with a huge influx of migrants boosted the anti-immigrant vote and contributed to the resounding defeat of its ruling party in last weekend's election, European officials acknowledge.
But given the difficulty of persuading all EU states to take their share of new arrivals, officials in Brussels now believe the bloc will have to take a harsher line on immigration.
""The message we hear is: continue being very, very tough on asylum. Be tough as you can on immigration. And then get even tougher,"" said a senior European Union diplomat.
Italy's center-left Democratic Party won less than a fifth of the votes, losing to anti-establishment and right-wing parties that campaigned hard against immigration. 
Under pressure from euroskeptic rivals, mainstream EU politicians read it as meaning they must take a hard line on immigration or risk losing power.
""Italy has, it's undeniable, suffered for months and months under the pressure of migration. This very strong migration pressure is a context we should keep in mind,"" said French President Emmanuel Macron.
About 170,000 refugees and migrants crossed the Mediterranean to Italy in 2014, according to U.N. figures. In the next two years arrivals were 154,000 and 181,500, before falling to 119,000 in 2017. 
Italy and Greece bore the brunt of the influx as the EU struggled to manage a crisis that delivers daily reminders of its urgency.
African immigrants marched through Florence on Monday chanting ""no more racism"" after an Italian man shot dead a Senegalese street vendor earlier in the day.
On Tuesday, officials said 21 migrants were missing and feared drowned when a rubber dinghy and a wooden boat had to be rescued after setting off from Libya for Italy.
The crisis that reached a head in 2015, when more than a million people arrived in Europe from the Middle East and Africa, has shaken the EU and fueled a wave of anti-immigration and euroskeptic sentiment.
The EU has since agreed deals - criticized by rights groups - with countries such as Turkey and Libya, offering them money and other help to keep people away from its shores.
The bloc has tightened its external borders and asylum laws and is spending more in distant countries to stop people from heading for Europe.
The Italian vote means the EU will stay on this course, officials in Brussels say, turning itself into what rights groups call ""Fortress Europe"".
In Austria, a government official said the vote was ""another wake-up call"" in support of the tougher migration policies advocated by Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.
BLAME GAME
But behind the EU's unity on the need to stop refugees and migrants arriving in the first place lies a more intractable problem.
While frontline states on the Mediterranean bore the immediate impact of the jump in immigration, and wealthy countries such as Germany and Sweden also took in large numbers, post-communist governments in the east refused to accept their share. 
Rome and Berlin blamed nationalist governments in Poland and Hungary for failing to show solidarity when it was needed, while they still accepted the development money western nations send to the bloc's poorer members.
""There is a problem with solidarity in Europe,"" Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said in Dublin on Monday. ""We are all part of the responsibility,"" he said, referring to the eastern Europeans.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar agreed that the whole EU must assist those most in need. 
Italy and Greece feel they have been left to manage on their own, while Germany, the Netherlands and France have pressed hard, if in vain, to break the resistance in the east. 
Some in the west have proposed cutting EU handouts for the east but the ex-communist states hit back.
Commenting on the Italian election, Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski said EU pressure over migration could backfire. 
""Today, the root of euroskepticism is in the founding members of the EU, while central and eastern Europe is a center of stability,"" he said.
Poland and Hungary, as well as Slovakia and the Czech Republic, cite security concerns and the need to preserve the traditional make-up of their societies in refusing to accept refugees from the Middle East and North Africa.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican on Tuesday signaled its concern over the results of Italy's national election, which saw sharp gains for populist and anti-immigrant parties.
The biggest winners were the League -- the largest party in a center-right grouping that employed the most fiery anti-migrant rhetoric during the campaign -- and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.
Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's Secretary of State, was asked on the sidelines of a conference on immigration if the Holy See was worried about the results.
""The Holy See has to work in whatever conditions arise. We can't (always) have the society that we would like to have, or the conditions that we would like to have,"" he told the Catholic news agency SIR.
It was the Vatican's first public reaction to the results and its most authoritative because Parolin, its top diplomat, ranks second only to Pope Francis in the Holy See's hierarchy.
During the campaign, League leader Matteo Salvini clashed with the pope several times over immigration.
When Francis backed a proposed law that would have granted Italian citizenship to children born in Italy of immigrant parents -- something the League vehemently opposed -- Salvini said Francis could house the children in the Vatican if he wanted to.
Political squabbling blocked discussion of the law before parliament was dissolved ahead of the elections.
Salvini also criticized the pope for promoting dialogue with Islam. Many of the Africans who made the dangerous crossing of the Mediterranean to reach Italy are Muslim.
Parolin said at the conference that the Vatican realized that the election results meant it would have to continue ""a work of education"" about the dignity and rights of immigrants.
Surveys show Italians are increasingly uneasy after more than 600,000 migrants reached Italy by boat in four years. Last month, a neo-Nazi wounded six migrants in a shooting spree in central Italy.
""Citizens must feel safe and protected but at the same time we can't slam doors in the faces of people who are fleeing violence and threats,"" Parolin said.
The pope, who was born in Argentina of Italian immigrant stock, has championed the cause of migrants since taking office in 2013.
Last year he called for a radical change of attitude towards immigrants, saying they should be welcomed with dignity and denouncing the ""populist rhetoric"" he said was fuelling fear and selfishness in rich countries.

The center-right has vowed to deport hundreds of thousands of migrants if they are able to form a government. 5-Star has also vowed to step up deportations of illegal immigrants.

(Reuters) - A nine-day strike by West Virginia teachers ended on Tuesday with state officials approving a 5 percent pay raise for all state workers, giving a boost to some of the lowest-paid educators in the country.
The walkout across the Appalachian state left more than 277,000 students idle as their teachers flooded the state capitol in Charleston to protest. Some schools planned to reopen on Wednesday after the deal was reached.
""Our children have suffered enough. We have to return some normalcy to the education process,"" Republican Governor Jim Justice said before signing the pay raise bill in a televised ceremony.
Teachers cheered in the halls of the state capitol after the pay deal was announced, a broadcast by the governor's office showed. West Virginia ranked 46th among the 50 U.S. states for average teacher pay last year at $45,783, according to the National Education Association.
Craig Blair, chairman of the Senate's Finance Committee, said he believed the pay raise was the biggest in state history. The Senate had initially sought a 4 percent raise, balking at a 5 percent hike approved by the House of Delegates.
""We've also done this without increasing any taxes at all,"" he said in a livestreamed meeting with House negotiators to reconcile differences in the chambers' bills. ""Now, there's going to be some pain.""
Blair said lawmakers would pay for the raise by cutting state spending by $20 million, taking funds from general services and Medicaid.
Randi Weingarten, head of the American Federation of Teachers, said by phone from West Virginia that the strike was indicative of the state's long history of labor activism as a coal mining hub and of the planning that educators had done before walking out.
""When you are pushed to the brink, people will stand up and show up and they will fight for themselves and their families,"" she said.

In Oklahoma, teachers are weighing a possible walkout over budget cuts that have led to four-day school weeks in the state and teachers' average salaries trailing those in West Virginia.

Zdenek Ondracek was narrowly elected by the lower house of parliament last Friday to head the commission - the first Communist lawmaker to hold such a post since the fall of communism nearly three decades ago.
The appointment was considered a signal the party was gaining influence as Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis's ANO party sought its support for a new government.
Thousands of Czechs protested in Prague and other cities against Ondracek's appointment on Monday evening and also against Babis, who had said over the weekend he would support Ondracek's recall from the committee. 
On Tuesday, Ondracek announced his resignation in parliament.
""I am not leaving this post because of a couple of loudmouths in the street, but because I have assessed the security situation of myself and my family,"" he said, mentioning unspecified threats against his family.
Many lawmakers opposed Ondracek, who was part of a police unit that used water cannon, clubs and dogs to disperse anti-regime protests in 1989. Those demonstrations eventually led to the peaceful overthrow of the Communist dictatorship in what became known as the Velvet Revolution.
The Communist party, which opposes NATO membership and holds pro-Russian views, has held out chances of support for Babis, whose minority cabinet lost a confidence vote in January even though ANO handily won an October election.
Other parties have mostly shunned Babis, who faces police charges of illegally obtaining European Union funds worth 2 million euros ($2.48 million) a decade ago. He denies wrongdoing.
His ANO party is chiefly negotiating with the Social Democrats whose chairman, Jan Hamacek, had said the party could join an ANO-led government but Babis' presence remained a problem.
Direct or indirect support might also come from the far-right, anti-EU SPD party of Czech-Japanese businessman Tomio Okamura - which has also raised concern among opposition parties and from some in ANO.

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",UK PM May to hold talks with Saudi Crown Prince at country residence,"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May will hold talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at her country residence on Thursday, diplomatic sources said, in another sign of the importance with which London is treating his visit.
The visit to Chequers, a 16th-century manor house 40 miles (60 km) northwest of London, will be in addition to a previously announced meeting at May's London office on Wednesday, the sources said on Tuesday. 
Prince Mohammed's visit, part of his first foreign tour as heir apparent, is aimed at persuading Britain that his reforms have made his country a better place to invest and a more tolerant society.
The trip will include lunch with Queen Elizabeth, a dinner with heir to the throne Prince Charles and his son Prince William, and meetings with British intelligence chiefs.
The inclusion of the prestigious trip to Chequers and two audiences with the British royal family demonstrate the extent to which London is prepared to endorse reforms in Saudi Arabia which have loosened social restrictions on women.
The visit is expected to attract protests from human rights campaigners particularly over Britain's licensing of 4.6 billion pounds ($6.4 billion) worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia since the start of a conflict in Yemen where more than 10,000 people have been killed.
Nevertheless, the British government is keen to use the trip to expand their longstanding alliance beyond defense and security, and into two-way trade and investment, eyeing both an expanded market in Saudi Arabia for service sector exports, and attracting Saudi cash to finance domestic projects.
The three-day visit, and a trip to the United States later this month, could also shape Saudi Arabia's decision on where to list oil giant Aramco - something Britain is keen to attract to the City of London - at a time when sources say the chances of London and New York hosting the IPO appear to be receding.

The Tashkent government hopes the March 26-27 conference will jumpstart the ""Afghan-owned, Afghan-led process for national reconciliation"", its foreign ministry said in a statement.
It is unclear, however, whether any Taliban representatives will be present at the meeting where Afghan President Ashraf Ghani is set to deliver a keynote speech.
The meeting will be the first such event to be hosted by Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who came to power in 2016 and has pledged to open up the resource-rich nation of 32 million to the outside world.
Tashkent has invited UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and his Special Representative for Afghanistan, Tadamichi Yamamoto, to the conference, as well as EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini, and her counterparts from China, Russia, the United States, Britain and many other countries.
It is, however, uncertain whether all of them will attend.
Mirziyoyev's office said last week that U.S. President Donald Trump supported the conference in a message, saying his ""administration is considering the composition of the relevant delegation of the United States"".
The Uzbek foreign ministry said it expected the meeting to adopt the resolution calling for ""guaranteed integration of the armed opposition into the political life of Afghanistan"" while condemning ""all forms and manifestations of terrorism"".
""Initiating the Tashkent Conference, Uzbekistan by no means intends to confine itself to arranging it as a one-off event, but to continue with vigorous efforts – both bilaterally and multilaterally – to promote a peaceful political process in Afghanistan,"" it said.
Mirziyoyev took over the predominantly Muslim former Soviet republic after the death of President Islam Karimov who had run it for more than a quarter of a century.
Tashkent's ties with the West were strained under Karimov who was often criticized over his government's human rights abuses.
Mirziyoyev has promised to liberalize the resource-rich nation and has embarked on a diplomatic campaign to bring in much-needed foreign investment.
